00:00 - everyone welcome to the final day of Cs
00:02 - edcon which is quite sad I know we've
00:03 - been having a great time together but
00:05 - I'm really excited uh to be your host MC
00:08 - for the last and best plenary of Cs
00:11 - edcon and we're going to be talking
00:12 - about the 2023 state of Cs report so if
00:14 - you already have your hard copy feel
00:16 - free to pull it out and follow along if
00:18 - you don't have it don't worry we have
00:20 - plenty left still at
00:23 - registration so I am excited uh to
00:25 - welcome up my co-authors so before I do
00:27 - that though my name is Hannah Weissman
00:29 - and I am the director of policy code.org
00:31 - and the author of the state of Cs report
00:34 - and I'm going to be joined on stage by
00:35 - two of my great co-authors so BT from
00:38 - the computer science Teachers
00:41 - Association and Josh Childs from esep so
00:45 - I'll be talking a little bit about uh my
00:47 - section of the report and then I'll turn
00:49 - it over to them uh so we will give you
00:50 - guys a great overview and you're again
00:52 - take it out and follow
00:55 - along so our big headline this year is
00:57 - that 2023 is the biggest year of growth
01:00 - since 2018 so well over half of high
01:02 - schools in the country now have access
01:04 - to foundational computer science and
01:05 - when you see where we started in 2018
01:07 - that is amazing progress and we should
01:09 - all feel incredibly proud of that so
01:11 - many more students have access to
01:12 - computer science than they did just five
01:14 - years ago and while we don't have data
01:16 - from 10 years ago would would be even
01:17 - worse 10 years ago so we've made so much
01:19 - progress um but I know that uh we're all
01:22 - a little competitive as well so we like
01:24 - the national number but we also like to
01:26 - see uh state facts as well so you can
01:28 - see that there really is a big range um
01:30 - in the country there's still states that
01:31 - have a minority of their schools
01:33 - offering computer science all the way to
01:35 - states that have almost every one of
01:37 - their high schools offering computer
01:38 - science um this map is in the book along
01:41 - with a lot of other ways to to see where
01:43 - your state ranks and and see what your
01:44 - neighbors are up
01:46 - to importantly as well just because
01:49 - computer science is offered doesn't
01:50 - necessarily mean that students are
01:52 - taking it so we are so excited this year
01:53 - to see that there are more students than
01:55 - ever before enrolled in computer
01:58 - science and so we have over 700,000 high
02:02 - school students taking computer science
02:04 - importantly we actually don't get data
02:05 - from every state so this number is even
02:07 - higher if we were to get data from all
02:09 - 50 states we also this year for the
02:11 - first time got data from a ton of States
02:13 - about middle school computer science so
02:16 - so many of us in this room right we know
02:17 - that early exposure is crucial we don't
02:19 - want the first computer science
02:20 - opportunity to be when a student is in
02:22 - ninth grade and so we had data from 19
02:24 - States this year that almost 350,000
02:27 - students were taking computer science
02:29 - that Middle School level and again if we
02:31 - had data from every state those numbers
02:33 - would be even higher so you can see in
02:35 - the state of Cs report there's a map
02:37 - that shows which states gave us data
02:38 - this year if your state is not included
02:40 - please reach out talk to your policy
02:42 - makers talk to your Department of
02:43 - Education we want to get data from every
02:45 - state it's so crucial for us to have
02:47 - that data to keep everyone accountable
02:50 - to be achieving our goals and really
02:51 - making sure that every student has uh
02:54 - both the ability to participate and then
02:56 - it's actually enrolled it's not just
02:57 - enough that they have a course offer but
02:59 - we we actually want to see all students
03:01 - enrolled in computer
03:02 - science and so with such tremendous
03:05 - growth in progress this year some of us
03:07 - might be asking how how did that happen
03:08 - and it's it's not a coincidence it's
03:10 - thanks to so many of us in this room
03:11 - here and a lot of it is due to policies
03:14 - right this doesn't happen overnight this
03:16 - is sustained Statewide commitment and
03:19 - effort and so these are the 10 policies
03:21 - recommended by the code.org aacy
03:23 - Coalition many of you in this room are a
03:25 - part of that advocacy Coalition and
03:27 - while I'm not going to go through all of
03:28 - these policies what they do is they make
03:30 - sure that there's the capacity to teach
03:31 - computer science they make sure there's
03:33 - developed and strong leaders at the
03:34 - school and administrative level and they
03:37 - make sure that students have access and
03:38 - that there is equity for all students
03:40 - taking computer science I do want to
03:42 - call out that this year the code.org
03:44 - absy Coalition added our 10th policy
03:46 - which is recommending that every state
03:48 - Implement a graduation requirement we
03:50 - have seen that even when students have
03:52 - the opportunity to take computer science
03:54 - they do not all enroll particularly our
03:56 - young women are economically
03:58 - disadvantaged students so graduation
04:00 - requirement means that every student has
04:02 - an opportunity uh an introductory
04:04 - computer science experience and then
04:06 - hopefully they go on to take more and
04:07 - continue exploring computer
04:10 - science so again we love a good map we
04:12 - love some competition so here you can
04:14 - see uh the policy adoption across state
04:16 - and one of the things that's really
04:17 - exciting that we passed a few years ago
04:19 - is that every state now has at least one
04:21 - policy promoting computer science at the
04:23 - Statewide level and that is really
04:25 - crucial to making sure that this doesn't
04:27 - uh disappear in a few years that it is
04:29 - part of the state's education ecosystem
04:31 - and you can see that we have several
04:33 - states that have all of our policies
04:35 - which is really exciting and just like
04:36 - how we're hoping to get every High
04:38 - School offering computer science we want
04:39 - every state on this map to be that dark
04:42 - blue so just to give you some quick um
04:45 - highlights from this past year we have
04:46 - 10 states that have nine or more
04:48 - policies and these states it's not a
04:50 - coincidence these states have really
04:52 - high access and they have high
04:53 - participation because their states have
04:55 - committed and invested uh at the state
04:57 - level uh to policies that ensure that
04:59 - their teachers and students are well
05:01 - prepared to succeed in computer science
05:03 - we also have three states this year that
05:05 - joined our five other states in having a
05:07 - computer science graduation requirements
05:09 - that's North Carolina North Dakota and
05:11 - Rhode Island So within the next five
05:12 - years all these states will be requiring
05:15 - uh to graduate high school to take a
05:16 - computer science
05:17 - course this year we had five states pass
05:20 - firsttime funding and that is so crucial
05:22 - because we see that once you pass
05:24 - funding for the first time it's so much
05:25 - easier to continue funding computer
05:27 - science to continue investing on the
05:29 - state level so we had Illinois Louisiana
05:32 - Michigan my home state of Minnesota uh
05:34 - and New Hampshire this year and that
05:36 - contributed to more money than ever
05:38 - before being allocated to Computer
05:39 - Science Education so we had over 120
05:42 - million and that's just at the state
05:43 - level that doesn't include any federal
05:45 - grants any money um from private or
05:47 - matches and so more money than ever been
05:50 - before has been flowing in to ensure
05:51 - that our teachers are well equipped and
05:53 - our students are prepared and excited
05:55 - for computer
05:57 - science now every year right we want we
05:59 - want to keep it interesting we don't
06:00 - want to have the same old thing every
06:02 - year so among the many new things in the
06:04 - report this year um is looking at the
06:06 - data uh by school size and
06:09 - so as some of you may be aware we
06:12 - actually have so many small high schools
06:14 - in this country over 50% of the high
06:16 - schools that are in this country are
06:17 - actually under 500 students and what we
06:20 - discovered this year is that it is so
06:22 - much harder for these high schools uh to
06:24 - be teaching computer science and so if
06:26 - we look at this graph here small high
06:28 - schools are student high schools with
06:30 - 500 students or less medium schools are
06:33 - uh between 500 and 1200 students and
06:36 - large schools are 1200 students or more
06:38 - so if we look at the large Schools
06:40 - they're almost all teaching computer
06:41 - science if a student is going to a
06:43 - school with more than 1,200 students
06:44 - they very very likely have access to
06:46 - computer science but that's contrasted
06:48 - with that most of the students at small
06:50 - high schools are not having access to
06:52 - computer science so when we think about
06:55 - that nationally we're at about 57 and a
06:57 - half% to get to that 100% % almost all
07:00 - of our work is going to be in small
07:02 - schools and as I mentioned for some of
07:03 - you who are at my session two days ago
07:06 - this is not just a rural issue there are
07:07 - small schools in urban areas Suburban
07:09 - areas rural areas these are public
07:11 - schools these are uh Charter Schools all
07:14 - of these schools need additional
07:16 - resources and help uh to get computer
07:18 - science offered we know that in these
07:19 - schools teachers often wear many hats um
07:22 - there might be less resources and so we
07:24 - really need to double down and invest to
07:25 - ensuring that students at these schools
07:27 - have access and are able to enroll and
07:29 - computer
07:30 - science I'm going to turn it over to BT
07:32 - now who's going to dig way more into the
07:34 - data with you all um and then uh talk
07:37 - about what we can do with that thanks
07:39 - Hannah yeah give it up for
07:41 - Hannah uh it's a pleasure to be here and
07:43 - to see you all again I'm BT from the
07:45 - computer science Teachers Association um
07:48 - and we have a lot to celebrate as Hannah
07:50 - just shared and I also want to share
07:53 - some things for us to reflect on and
07:54 - hopefully motivate us because we have
07:56 - some persistent Equity gaps who want to
08:00 - discuss first with regards to access
08:03 - which means offering a foundational high
08:05 - school computer science course um this
08:07 - chart shows access by student race and
08:10 - ethnicity and the labels are small but
08:13 - the first four I'll highlight are Native
08:15 - American Alaskan black latinx a native
08:18 - Hawaiian and Pacific Islander and they
08:20 - are all less likely to have access to CS
08:23 - at their High School than their uh white
08:26 - and Asian
08:28 - peers and I should also the the good
08:31 - news is all of these bars have risen
08:35 - over the last couple of years so we are
08:37 - making some steady progress
08:40 - here I also want to highlight that these
08:42 - numbers are different than participation
08:45 - which means enrollment in a course for
08:47 - example the first chart the first bar on
08:50 - the left side is 67% of Native Americans
08:53 - have access to high school CS far fewer
08:56 - actually participate in CS that's one of
08:58 - our biggest gaps and there's a
09:01 - phenomenal report from capore Center in
09:03 - Asus just released I'd recommend you
09:05 - read it to learn more about this Equity
09:08 - Gap uh we're going to transition talking
09:10 - about participation so participation is
09:13 - instead enrollment in those High School
09:15 - CS courses and this chart shows
09:18 - enrollment um disagreed by race and
09:20 - ethnicity and over the last three years
09:24 - participation by race ethnicity has been
09:26 - fairly consistent the
09:29 - kind of dark green bar shows the
09:32 - national demographics of that group and
09:34 - the light green bar shows their
09:36 - enrollment in high school CS courses and
09:39 - we see across these that nationally
09:42 - black native Hawaiian multiracial
09:44 - students and white students are
09:45 - proportionately represented to their
09:48 - enrollment in the schools Asian students
09:50 - are over represented and latinx and
09:52 - Native American and Alaskan students are
09:55 - underrepresented and in fact latinx
09:58 - students are pretty likely to attend a
10:01 - high school that offers computer science
10:03 - but they are far less likely to enroll
10:05 - in it there's a strong uh participation
10:08 - Gap here latinx students are 1.4 times
10:11 - less likely than their white indan peers
10:13 - to take foundational CS in high
10:16 - school another persistent Gap is with
10:20 - girls only 31% of young women are
10:23 - enrolled in high school computer science
10:25 - this has been the same over the last few
10:28 - years
10:30 - what that also means is with relative
10:32 - race and ethnicity parity but this
10:35 - gender gap we know that girls of color
10:37 - are most impacted they have that double
10:40 - bind and that means they're far less
10:43 - likely to enroll in
10:46 - CS there are other inequities Beyond
10:49 - race ethnicity gender school size uh so
10:51 - some to highlight some of these other
10:53 - subgroups we know that multilingual
10:55 - Learners students with disabilities and
10:59 - economically disadvantaged students are
11:00 - all underrepresented compared to their
11:02 - representation in the school in FAL
11:05 - computer
11:08 - science um some good news the efforts to
11:12 - teach computer science at the K levels
11:15 - have led to less pronounced disparities
11:18 - and this is true
11:20 - across all or most of the trends and one
11:23 - example is with gender so we just showed
11:25 - that 31% of uh girls enroll in high
11:28 - school CS in middle school that number
11:31 - is 44% and in elementary school it's 49%
11:35 - so we see far closer to
11:38 - parity and these group these numbers
11:41 - give an incomplete story and that's
11:44 - because we can see where CS is offered
11:47 - we have data around who takes it but we
11:51 - don't yet know at scale what that
11:53 - experience is like for them because
11:56 - really it matters the interactions
11:57 - between students stents and their
12:00 - teachers so in the report you'll find a
12:02 - number of quotes and stories embedded
12:04 - throughout that try to paint a better
12:06 - picture about what is driving that work
12:09 - and I'd be remiss if I didn't
12:11 - acknowledge the incredible work of the
12:13 - K12 teachers that lead to these changes
12:17 - and are disrupting inequities and are
12:19 - creating inclusive environments for
12:21 - their students that lead them to want to
12:23 - to continue to pursue CS um so I want to
12:25 - take a moment to thank those teachers
12:27 - yeah let's do that
12:29 - [Applause]
12:30 - um and as the world's largest CS
12:34 - department csda is here to support them
12:36 - and help connect them to other teachers
12:37 - so we welcome you to join our department
12:40 - as well as invite teachers to do the
12:42 - same uh now I'm to turn over to Josh
12:44 - he's going to talk about how to use a
12:48 - report thanks
12:50 - be thanks BT appreciate it and we
12:53 - appreciate the partnership that we have
12:55 - with code.org and csta when it comes to
12:57 - producing this report
12:59 - uh group of us last night went to dinner
13:02 - and then to the
13:04 - sphere how many of y'all went to the
13:06 - sphere or went to some show there we go
13:07 - look at the hands raised and it reminded
13:10 - me
13:11 - or uh really helped me to really double
13:14 - down the fact that CS matters CS
13:17 - education matters and all of us in the
13:19 - room are committed to seeing its growth
13:22 - seeing sustained and seeing more and
13:24 - more students and their families and
13:26 - communities getting impacted and access
13:28 - and participating in computer science
13:31 - and so as thinking about how do we use
13:33 - this report after you've flipped through
13:35 - the pages I don't know about you when
13:37 - you get a nice new book or report I like
13:38 - to sniff it a little bit get that new
13:40 - smell in
13:42 - me what next how do we use it and so I
13:46 - think about the student this the name of
13:49 - the session is the state of Cs in 2030
13:52 - so I'm thinking that student right now
13:54 - who's in their room or in the
13:56 - classroom they're designing some kind
13:58 - kind of robotic dog or dingo that may go
14:02 - to Google or Microsoft or NSF one day
14:05 - and say I want to fund something like
14:07 - this that could help address and answer
14:11 - some problems that are in society right
14:13 - now so how do we think about this report
14:16 - for what we want to see in the future
14:18 - with cs
14:19 - education well for one you all have a
14:21 - hard copy that you got to registration
14:23 - Hannah said there's more that you can
14:24 - get uh later on there's also a pdf
14:27 - online that you can provide the
14:30 - stakeholders and folks back at
14:33 - home to know more about the data in
14:35 - their
14:36 - state and about the national landscape
14:38 - around CS
14:40 - education including State handouts about
14:43 - your individual State and word it ranks
14:47 - in comparison to other states to a
14:49 - similar size and
14:51 - scope there's also a very unique and
14:53 - very cool data dashboard that's
14:56 - online that provides filters ways in
14:59 - which to access data based on different
15:02 - demographics and your local school so
15:06 - dig into that and you can find that at
15:08 - advocacy. code.org
15:12 - stateof
15:15 - Cs and as you think about this work as
15:18 - we leave Las Vegas later today or
15:21 - tonight on the red
15:23 - eyee how do we think about the work when
15:25 - it comes to expanding capacity
15:30 - how do we think about the work in CS
15:31 - when it comes to access for
15:34 - students how do we think about
15:36 - participation in CS for our students in
15:39 - our schools and most importantly what's
15:42 - the experience of Cs education for
15:45 - students around our
15:48 - country and so thinking of this
15:50 - framework that it guides our work in
15:52 - esep developed by my colleague Carol
15:55 - Fletcher and jce Warner at the
15:56 - University of Texas how do we think
15:58 - think about this work and our work where
16:00 - we're trying to impact what happens in
16:03 - CS classrooms around the
16:07 - country so
16:09 - now after this session after we go home
16:12 - this is where we kick in this is where
16:15 - our advocacy kicks into high gear to
16:18 - seeing the what we want to see in CS
16:20 - education so we got to identify who our
16:22 - audience
16:24 - is that's
16:26 - Educators that's policy
16:29 - makers that's industry
16:31 - leaders and community members students
16:35 - families small business owners all of
16:38 - those that are impacted or
16:41 - impact computer
16:44 - science and so thinking about how will
16:48 - you tailor your message and your message
16:51 - and your group's message in the back to
16:54 - the relevant audience that you want to
16:56 - see engaged in in computer
17:00 - science and most importantly who needs
17:03 - to know more about this report and the
17:05 - data that's embedded within the report
17:07 - and online and in the dashboard to help
17:10 - Advance this work
17:12 - further and then finally how do we
17:16 - Advocate it's not enough to keep what we
17:18 - have gained over the last two and a half
17:20 - days inside our head but how do we
17:23 - Advocate to that community and to that
17:26 - audience once we leave out of these
17:28 - doors
17:29 - and down those convention steps well
17:31 - first you got to ask the question how
17:32 - will you use the data in this report to
17:35 - make sense of the disparities that BT
17:37 - talked so wonderfully
17:39 - about in computer
17:43 - science second what
17:46 - actions and this says team but I want to
17:49 - flip that a little bit what actions will
17:51 - you take to address these disparities
17:56 - that we known about that you've heard
17:58 - over and over again not just here but in
18:00 - other conferences I know it's how our
18:02 - CSS folks work right we go from one week
18:05 - to the next week we gather at State
18:07 - Summit some other week we'll get
18:08 - together at another place right we hear
18:11 - the same thing over and over again so
18:12 - what are we going to do differ when we
18:14 - walk out of this room with this year's
18:17 - report and then finally how will you
18:20 - engage
18:21 - individuals from underrepresented
18:25 - populations to develop strategies in
18:28 - collab
18:29 - cation
18:30 - together not just for them but with them
18:34 - to address some of these deep
18:36 - disparities that we see in CS
18:40 - education again thank you to our
18:42 - partnership with code.org and the
18:44 - computer science Teachers Association
18:46 - for this work I want to give credit to
18:48 - the other Co co-author who's sitting in
18:50 - the audience Sarah dudon who I get to
18:51 - work with every day I'm G turn it back
18:53 - over to
18:56 - Hannah that
18:59 - all right thank you so much Josh and BT
19:02 - um you know 20 minutes is not enough to
19:04 - talk about a report that took us months
19:05 - to write uh but it's a little a little
19:07 - sneak peek for you all so we have put
19:09 - our contact information up here because
19:11 - the report is the beginning of a
19:13 - conversation please reach out to us we
19:15 - want to hear from you how are you using
19:17 - the report how can we make it better for
19:19 - future years this is a a product of a
19:21 - collaborative Community we want that
19:23 - conversation to continue uh so please I
19:25 - look forward to emails in my inbox uh
19:28 - hopefully not this weekend but maybe
19:29 - next week um so you know there was one
19:33 - other thing that we didn't mention and
19:34 - it wasn't an accident because I didn't
19:36 - want to steal the Thunder from the next
19:37 - folks um but one of the other things
19:39 - that is new this year in the report is
19:41 - AI right we've been talking so much
19:43 - about AI the last few days and how that
19:45 - impacts education but particularly how
19:47 - that impacts Computer Science Education
19:49 - right that is why we're all here and
19:51 - thinking about how we can best equip our
19:53 - teachers and students in computer
19:54 - science education and that includes AI
19:57 - so that iscl included in the report it's
20:00 - mentioned the executive summary in the
20:01 - introduction and it actually has its own
20:03 - section this year where it talks about
20:04 - the changing landscape and some
20:06 - guidelines and Frameworks for States and
20:08 - policy makers so that leads me to
20:10 - introducing the next part of our panel
20:12 - and I'm so excited to welcome on to the
20:14 - stage Patrick oin he is going to be the
20:16 - moderator of the next panel and they're
20:18 - going to be talking all about Ai and how
20:20 - that's going to impact uh the future of
20:21 - Computer Science Education so Patrick
20:24 - I'll welcome you on up to the
20:27 - stage
20:34 - I good
20:38 - morning let's hear it one more time for
20:40 - Hannah BT Josh congratulations on the
20:43 - release of the state ofcs
20:45 - report such a hugely impactful resource
20:48 - for our community and uh really taking
20:50 - to heart that that call to action in
20:51 - terms of you know leveraging this as a
20:54 - resource to go out in the work that
20:55 - we're doing as we leave Las Vegas um um
20:58 - so thank you for that um so yeah I'm
21:00 - Patrick oin I'm director of teacher
21:02 - skills within Microsoft philanthropies
21:04 - we're focused at Microsoft
21:06 - philanthropies on empowering nonprofits
21:08 - and communities with digital and AI
21:10 - capabilities to really Drive inclusive
21:12 - economic growth and So within that team
21:15 - I'm focused and my team is focused on
21:16 - teacher Skilling and so we do that
21:19 - through efforts whether that's free
21:20 - content resources Partnerships with
21:22 - nonprofit organizations like code.org
21:24 - csta csforall and others represented
21:27 - here um and supporting teachers in areas
21:29 - of Cs education AI cyber security and
21:32 - sustainability so just wanted to
21:34 - introduce myself for for folks that I
21:35 - haven't had the opportunity to meet yet
21:37 - so you have a little bit more context on
21:39 - on myself um so I have the privilege of
21:42 - moderating this panel of course we've
21:43 - been talking throughout the week about
21:46 - the impact of AI on education r large
21:49 - and the impact of AI on the workforce um
21:51 - but we haven't had as much of a kind of
21:53 - focused conversation on the impact of AI
21:56 - on CS education specific Al what is the
21:58 - future of Cs education in the context of
22:02 - AI in education what role does CS
22:04 - education play in teaching students to
22:08 - uh learn about how to use AI how to
22:10 - create with AI how to create AI
22:12 - Technologies and also how to do so
22:14 - responsibly and with the ethical impacts
22:16 - of computing uh on society in mind so
22:19 - lots to unpack there we have a fantastic
22:21 - panel lined up three uh individuals with
22:24 - varied perspectives and uh backgrounds
22:27 - that I think we're going to have a great
22:28 - Focus discussion here so first up I'd
22:30 - like to call to the stage Janna de
22:33 - philippus who is the senior program
22:34 - manager for public policy and economic
22:36 - graph at
22:39 - LinkedIn welcome
22:41 - Janna next up we have Jeff Forbes who is
22:45 - the program director for education and
22:47 - Workforce at
22:48 - nsf's uh directorate for computer and
22:51 - information sciences and Engineering I
22:53 - think I got that
22:56 - right please correct me if I miss messed
22:58 - that up and perhaps doesn't need an
23:01 - introduction but I will do so uh
23:03 - nonetheless the co-founder and CEO of
23:05 - code.org hadti
23:08 - partovi welcome
23:14 - hadti all right so I have a range of
23:17 - different questions here some of which
23:19 - I'm GNA ask to to individual panelists
23:21 - others I'll just open it up to to any of
23:23 - you to respond to and we can kind of uh
23:25 - build off the conversation from from one
23:26 - another um there's a chance we may have
23:28 - some opportunity for for questions in
23:30 - the audience although this this panel is
23:32 - a little bit more abbreviated than some
23:34 - of the other plenary panel sessions that
23:35 - we've had uh so so we'll just kind of
23:37 - monitor the time and see what's what's
23:39 - possible but I'd like to start with uh
23:41 - Janna in terms of um you know your work
23:44 - at LinkedIn and the work that your team
23:45 - does you recently published a report
23:47 - back in August um around the future of
23:50 - work uh as it relates to AI the AI
23:52 - impact on future work in a variety of
23:54 - different um uh spaces whether that's
23:56 - the roles that will be impacted how they
23:57 - might be impacted um different skills
24:00 - and how that plays into it so I think
24:02 - really just centering this question
24:03 - around skills and so what what are we
24:04 - hearing or seeing or learning from
24:06 - industry as it relates to the the skills
24:08 - that are needed around uh Ai and
24:10 - specific to CS thank you Patrick and
24:13 - it's great to be here today um let me
24:16 - start by saying that on LinkedIn we're
24:17 - seeing that AI skills are in high demand
24:20 - and growing fast job postings mentioning
24:23 - AI Tech like gbt or chat gbt have shot
24:27 - up 2 one times since this time last year
24:30 - um we're also seeing a high demand for
24:32 - AI skills and Technical roles like
24:34 - software engineer and data scientist the
24:37 - top AI skills we're seeing on the
24:39 - platform include um the software Library
24:42 - tensor flow or the python package pandas
24:45 - as well as some more General AI skills
24:48 - like um data structures or algorithm
24:51 - development um the fastest growing AI
24:54 - skills we're seeing include computer
24:56 - vision classific ation and natural
24:58 - language processing among among others
25:02 - um it's important to note that even for
25:04 - AI jobs so jobs that have ai in the
25:07 - title like AI engineer or head of AI um
25:10 - or require multiple AI skills on their
25:12 - job postings we're seeing a pretty even
25:14 - mix of technical skills and these AI
25:17 - skills specifically as well as people
25:20 - skills or soft skills um skills like
25:23 - communication and ethics um so it would
25:26 - be really important when thinking about
25:28 - teaching um computer science students
25:31 - and preparing them for the workforce
25:32 - that they're getting an education that
25:33 - includes the mix of technical
25:36 - proficiency and some of these other
25:39 - capabilities yeah thanks for that I
25:41 - related to that interestingly I was um I
25:43 - was on a different panel a few months
25:44 - ago and kind of asked a related question
25:46 - and so as prepar preparation for that
25:48 - panel I had gone through uh on the
25:50 - Microsoft career site and just kind of
25:52 - done an informal look at um job
25:54 - descriptions for kind of junior level
25:56 - development positions and I was looking
25:58 - through the skills that were listed in
25:59 - there and so many of them are kind of
26:02 - more of those soft skills that you're
26:03 - talking about around communication
26:04 - collaboration and teamwork um but also
26:06 - being able to read and interpret code
26:08 - and uh things of that nature and and you
26:11 - know of course there's a little bit in
26:12 - there in terms of you know fundamental
26:13 - knowledge and understanding of these
26:14 - data structures algorithms Etc but a lot
26:16 - around like yeah interpretation of code
26:18 - working with others on code um being a
26:20 - key piece of that which I think is kind
26:22 - of reflected in in the report as
26:25 - well one question I have for the kind of
26:27 - the whole group to respond to is just
26:28 - kind of again in the space of thinking
26:30 - about um the skills that we want
26:32 - students to to gain from a a computer
26:34 - science class especially if we're
26:35 - thinking about computer science class in
26:37 - you know 2030 as it was mentioned like
26:39 - we're thinking about the state of Cs in
26:41 - in 2030 you know uh a point of
26:44 - conversation that's come up in this
26:45 - community and in CS education over the
26:48 - last several years is that CS is is more
26:50 - than just programming right there's
26:51 - computational thinking is core to uh to
26:54 - uh to computer science so computational
26:57 - thinking in particular curious to get
26:59 - reactions from from the panelists in
27:00 - terms of do you see that how we think
27:02 - about that evolving um in light of of uh
27:05 - generative AI technology if so how um
27:08 - and how how do we really ensure that
27:09 - students are growing those skills in
27:11 - particular um in the future of
27:13 - Cs so uh yeah I do think that this is a
27:17 - pretty big change and I particularly
27:20 - like what you said uh Patrick about
27:22 - reading code um one of the things uh
27:26 - computational thinking uh was uh first
27:30 - uh uh at termed I guess by our uh prior
27:34 - director from NSF who really wanted to
27:37 - think about you know what are the key
27:39 - things that everyone needs to learn in
27:41 - our society today given that how much
27:44 - computation drives everything and it's
27:47 - really amazing that like a lot of that
27:49 - still applies today but there has been a
27:52 - real big shift right and I think there's
27:54 - going to be even bigger shift as we go
27:55 - forward into 2030 uh one of the
27:58 - anecdotes I like is a tweet where
28:01 - someone said they saw someone in a cafe
28:04 - who was just programming on their laptop
28:07 - without using any AI code generation
28:08 - tools it's like what's the matter with
28:10 - this person it's like seeing someone mow
28:13 - along with scissors like what like
28:17 - what's going on but I do think um you
28:20 - know we do look at uh what's happening
28:23 - across the country and um while we code
28:28 - and trying to think about code and
28:30 - trying to do a lot of the other things
28:32 - we expect in competitional thinking are
28:34 - expected it's uh there's a whole lot
28:37 - more that's people trying to write code
28:41 - people trying to solve particular
28:43 - problems and I think we're going to see
28:45 - a lot more in getting back to a lot of
28:48 - the uh tenants of competitional thinking
28:51 - you know what are how do we decompose
28:53 - problems how do we think about the
28:55 - impact of what's Happening how do we uh
28:59 - how are we able to ask questions about
29:02 - the data that we have and then know
29:04 - whether those answers are correct I
29:06 - think there's a lot that we're going to
29:07 - learn as we move forward uh with our new
29:10 - great
29:13 - tools hi everybody I have a lot of
29:15 - thoughts on this question so I don't
29:17 - know how to answer briefly um the first
29:19 - thing I want to say relative to what J
29:21 - shared about the skills on LinkedIn is I
29:24 - think you know today's job descriptions
29:26 - about AI talk about specific AI skills
29:29 - for an AI job uh but when it comes to
29:31 - the types of jobs people post on
29:33 - LinkedIn we are quickly moving to the
29:35 - point where every single job will have
29:37 - an expectation that you use AI because
29:40 - every single software tool out there is
29:43 - going to be adopting some form of AI so
29:45 - if you use Salesforce as a salesperson
29:48 - Salesforce is going to be using AI to
29:50 - pre-generate emails that you send to
29:52 - people uh if you use Photoshop as a
29:55 - graphic designer that already now has
29:57 - generative Ai and it's going to be
29:59 - almost redundant to say that you need to
30:01 - know how to use the AI aspects of
30:03 - Photoshop and using AI is going to be
30:06 - part of basic digital literacy but when
30:09 - we think about computer science in AI
30:10 - there's probably the greatest change um
30:13 - you know people have done surveys of of
30:16 - folks asking what Industries or What
30:18 - professions are going to be the most
30:20 - impacted by generative AI number one is
30:23 - software engineering number two is
30:25 - teaching so the combination of teaching
30:28 - and computer science is sort of at this
30:30 - Vortex of change because it both
30:33 - involves changing what we teach and
30:34 - involves changing how we teach it uh and
30:37 - both of those things are are quite
30:39 - relevant um the and what i' also want to
30:42 - add is that generative AI is just a part
30:45 - of an evolution and is a fast moving
30:47 - Target so just thinking around how does
30:50 - what we have seen in the last 12 months
30:53 - impact CS education for 10 years from
30:55 - now isn't enough because there's going
30:56 - to be this ongoing effort by the people
30:59 - creating these AI tools to add a greater
31:02 - level of critical thinking problem
31:04 - solving reasoning removing bias removing
31:07 - misinformation all the flaws we
31:09 - currently see there's somebody or teams
31:11 - of people working to remove those flaws
31:14 - uh and so it's going to be challenging
31:16 - and keep up with that but what is
31:17 - definitely clear is that the rot work of
31:21 - sort of coding is going to be reduced
31:23 - and the more sort of computational
31:26 - thinking work of break down problems or
31:28 - abstraction those are going to be
31:30 - increased uh even though code.org is
31:32 - called code.org uh as people who use our
31:35 - platform know that almost all the coding
31:37 - we teach is using blocks um using the
31:40 - blockly language which is how you learn
31:42 - the algorithmic thinking and ignore
31:44 - frankly or never even see the syntax
31:47 - because the syntax is going to be
31:48 - increasingly less important uh and So
31:50 - within CS education teaching how AI
31:53 - works and using that a AI to to solve
31:56 - problems is is going to rise in
31:58 - importance um the actual nitty-gritty of
32:01 - where did the semicolon go and you close
32:02 - your parentheses those are going to be
32:04 - less and less the things we deal with
32:06 - which I actually think makes programming
32:09 - much much more accessible uh and focuses
32:11 - on things like the creativity and the
32:13 - things that engage humans rather than
32:15 - the things that make it sort of nerdy
32:17 - and difficult yeah great insights thank
32:20 - you perhaps we'll see even kind of more
32:23 - block coding to your point there as as
32:24 - we get into to you know visioning to
32:27 - 2030 where the emphasis on introduction
32:29 - to computer science really leverages
32:31 - that even more as a a way to teach those
32:33 - uh computational thinking algorithmic
32:35 - thinking as well um and I like your
32:37 - point too hottie in terms of the impact
32:39 - on on teaching and software engineering
32:41 - and and and to to kind of build into
32:43 - that uh some of the conversations that
32:44 - have also come up that doesn't mean that
32:46 - that teachers and software Engineers
32:48 - necessarily are losing their job it's
32:50 - changing how those jobs are uh are
32:52 - working and that's I think an important
32:54 - point to to underscore as well um
32:57 - my next question is for Jeff um
33:00 - specifically and it's around just kind
33:01 - of if there's any early research just
33:03 - within your your work stream that you've
33:04 - seen uh into the use of generative AI in
33:07 - the highered space you know at the the
33:09 - maybe cs1 uh intro level CS courses
33:11 - where uh there's been experimentation
33:13 - with integration of of generative AI uh
33:16 - tools into those classes or any anything
33:18 - you've been hearing from that community
33:19 - of uh higher education faculty as it
33:21 - relates to lessons that that the K12
33:23 - sector could could learn from yeah uh
33:26 - there're actually been a remarkable
33:28 - amount of work done over the past year
33:30 - it turns out uh and it's difficult
33:33 - because it is such a moving Target but I
33:37 - think some of the lessons that we get
33:39 - there was a uh uh working group at the
33:42 - international computer science
33:44 - conference and uh Computer Science
33:47 - Education conference excuse me uh and
33:49 - you know what did they find well you
33:52 - turns out these tools work right they
33:54 - work really well uh for introductory uh
33:58 - programming right so what do I mean when
34:00 - I say that they work well they help
34:02 - students uh complete the tasks they make
34:05 - sure they complete the task and their
34:07 - Solutions are better um they're of
34:10 - course able to do it in less time but
34:12 - what's also remarkable is that you would
34:15 - think well um they're not able to maybe
34:19 - understand as much as one might think
34:21 - but they've even had studies where uh
34:24 - they had a group of uh students aged 10
34:27 - through 17 working on projects and half
34:30 - had access to uh AI code generation
34:33 - tools and half didn't um the ones who
34:37 - did have access to the AI uh generation
34:40 - tools of course you know did the
34:42 - assignments very well and did them
34:43 - quicker but also when they had to do
34:46 - things like code modification without
34:49 - the AI generation tool they did it just
34:51 - as well and when you ask them about uh
34:54 - doing the test not on the uh tool they
34:58 - did just as well in fact uh they in some
35:03 - cases uh did better especially if they
35:06 - this was a a camp that was in Python if
35:08 - they had prior scratch experience it
35:10 - turned out that that actually uh allowed
35:13 - them to use the tools even better now it
35:16 - is key that we think about how we teach
35:19 - in these environments right that it's
35:22 - not just about you know what we're
35:24 - teaching but how we teach and how we
35:27 - prepare to teach what the resources are
35:29 - that we're going to be providing
35:30 - students and there's been a lot of work
35:33 - on that and a lot of work also looking
35:36 - at how um faculty are trying to address
35:40 - these issues because as you can imagine
35:43 - there's a variety of levels of comfort
35:46 - with this right I imagine you all have
35:49 - to do an incredible amount to update uh
35:52 - a lot of the great tools that you
35:54 - already have out there that's asking a
35:56 - lot of uh curriculum developers are
35:59 - asking a lot of Faculty but I do think
36:02 - this is really an opportunity based on
36:04 - all the research that we're seeing that
36:06 - this does have a substantial impact um
36:10 - but it does appear that you still do
36:13 - want people to take these classes
36:14 - because the impact does get less the
36:17 - higher up the curriculum you're going
36:20 - right so now that may change because one
36:23 - of the things we're finding are the
36:24 - newer tools are better than the old
36:27 - tools but it does seem to be the case
36:29 - that you do want to learn some of these
36:32 - things because if you want to succeed in
36:34 - some of the later courses you do need uh
36:37 - currently at least uh to have gone
36:40 - through these introduction classes which
36:42 - have some of the same learning
36:43 - objectives before but now you're
36:45 - incorporating AI Tools in as one of the
36:48 - things that students and teachers are
36:50 - using yeah thanks for that Jee and I
36:52 - think kind of going up to the from
36:54 - highed to Industry there's actually been
36:56 - some interesting research that that
36:58 - GitHub has done related to the use of
37:00 - the GitHub co-pilot technology kind of
37:02 - code assistance technology uh leveraging
37:04 - generative Ai and they've found in their
37:06 - early research of developers that are
37:07 - using that tool that not only are they
37:10 - producing code more more quickly but
37:12 - there's also in terms of the sentiments
37:13 - of the developers that are using the
37:15 - tools that they're finding themselves
37:16 - more fulfilled by the work that they're
37:18 - doing because they're putting aside some
37:20 - of the more uh timec consuming menial
37:22 - tasks and able to focus their time on
37:24 - what really matters to them so kind of
37:26 - just building on some of the the pieces
37:27 - that you were seeing in the research at
37:28 - the higher ed space as well Jeff um
37:32 - curious to kind of zoom in like for this
37:34 - exercise of future of Cs in in 2030 and
37:37 - hotti I was particularly interested to
37:39 - get your perspective on this question of
37:41 - like if we're sitting in a in a computer
37:42 - science class you know seven years from
37:44 - now um what what do you think that would
37:47 - look like from a pedagogical perspective
37:50 - um you know what a lot of I think for
37:52 - most of us that have been in a computer
37:54 - science class or computer science
37:55 - teachers ourselves a lot of time spent
37:57 - students at their computers coding um do
37:59 - you expect that to to continue to be the
38:02 - case or how do you think uh things will
38:04 - will will evolve in that classroom
38:05 - setting uh in terms of instruction and
38:07 - pedagogy and just how students are
38:08 - spending their time I'm really curious
38:10 - to get your your thoughts on that I know
38:12 - you mentioned previously hottie in terms
38:13 - of like wrote work uh being reduced and
38:16 - there was a comment earlier from Jeff I
38:18 - think about like code reading more than
38:20 - code writing um so kind of pulling
38:21 - together a few threads curious to to get
38:23 - your your vision and thoughts there
38:25 - hottie um
38:27 - I didn't know this question was coming
38:28 - so I have to think about my answer and I
38:30 - also would say I don't want my answer to
38:32 - carry too much weight because I'm coming
38:34 - up with it right now this isn't like the
38:37 - seven-year plan for code. Works work no
38:39 - worries any members of my team in the
38:41 - room this isn't like our our our
38:44 - seven-year agenda um i' first say nobody
38:48 - knows exactly what things are going to
38:49 - be like in seven years I'm not sure at
38:51 - any point you could predict that but
38:52 - with this pace of change it's quite
38:55 - difficult uh so I can the things I'm
38:57 - most sure of are the trends I mentioned
38:59 - which is learning more about how AI
39:01 - works and learning more how to use Ai
39:04 - and learning less about rote repetitive
39:06 - stuff uh uh you know the reduction of
39:08 - rote and repetitive work in computer
39:10 - science isn't a new trend you know uh
39:13 - when my father was learning it computer
39:14 - science involved punching holes in
39:17 - cardboard you know and to represent ones
39:20 - and zeros uh and you know right before I
39:22 - went to college people were learning an
39:24 - assembly language because that was the
39:26 - the the primary way you learned and each
39:29 - decade typing code has become closer and
39:33 - closer to English uh and we're going to
39:36 - continue on that path um I expect
39:39 - block-based programming will actually
39:41 - increase and you know syntactical coding
39:44 - will be will decrease because it'll be
39:46 - more like oh not everybody needs to do
39:48 - that um in fact I wouldn't be surprised
39:50 - if the generative tools for coding
39:52 - generate block looking stuff and you
39:54 - don't need to look at the stuff
39:55 - underneath because that's the part that
39:57 - the computer definitely has has done a
39:59 - better job of um uh one thing I think I
40:03 - mentioned a couple days ago I especially
40:05 - think HTML coding is going to drop in in
40:08 - sort of what you teach in a high school
40:10 - or middle school class because jobs in
40:13 - HTML coding are also going to just
40:15 - generally those are going to be things
40:16 - that tools like canva or other tools
40:19 - just automatically generate HTML for us
40:22 - uh in the same way that Assembly
40:24 - Language coding is not something people
40:25 - do um
40:26 - the the one thing I'd say that I'll
40:28 - probably you know every time I think
40:30 - about it slightly blows my own mind and
40:32 - I'm not sure whether this is in four
40:34 - years or seven years or 10 uh but if you
40:37 - if you try the current chat GPT audio
40:40 - like UI where you can speak to it and it
40:42 - speaks back and you're not typing it
40:44 - just it's speaking um that's already
40:46 - here today we're not very far from a
40:49 - point where your an AI teacher can be
40:53 - sort of a person that you speak to that
40:55 - looks like like a person it could even
40:57 - have the visuals of like it could be me
41:00 - you know somebody did a 3D scan of me in
41:02 - a in a measure of my voice or or you
41:04 - know any any celebrity or Tech leader or
41:08 - whatever that is your teacher and you
41:10 - speak to them and it speaks to you uh as
41:13 - it and this is not just in CS education
41:15 - all of Education there's this
41:17 - opportunity to have a real AI tutor not
41:20 - like a chat bot that types and you need
41:21 - to read what it says uh and I suspect
41:24 - we'll see things like that before the
41:27 - end of this decade how that impacts all
41:29 - of Education uh I'm certain that the
41:31 - role of a teacher will continue to
41:33 - become more of a facilitator and a coach
41:36 - and the role of a curriculum developer
41:38 - is going to be more of using this kind
41:40 - of AI to basically uh not just deliver
41:43 - information but deliver interactive
41:45 - teaching and coaching and that's going
41:47 - to be wild in its impacts but I think
41:49 - it'll increase equity and it'll give a a
41:53 - much broader set of people access to the
41:55 - best educators
41:57 - thank you yeah sorry to put you on the
41:59 - spot there with that one but I
42:00 - appreciate the answer and agree in terms
42:02 - of the the pace of change and how much
42:04 - that's impacting the entire education
42:06 - community and um how you know we all
42:09 - here in this room and and others other
42:11 - leaders in education CS education Ai and
42:13 - education really need to support the
42:15 - community in adapting to to these
42:17 - technological changes um to support our
42:21 - students um you mentioned Equity there
42:23 - at the end HTI I just want to kind of
42:25 - Bring It uh conversation to that that
42:27 - space for the the whole panel to respond
42:29 - to as as you choose um you know we saw
42:32 - from the state of Cs report uh that
42:34 - there's been improvements in there's uh
42:36 - in terms of equity and access um some
42:39 - some lags in some cases uh that were
42:41 - called out in terms of participation so
42:43 - obviously we're all well familiar with
42:45 - uh the the persistent e Equity gaps that
42:47 - have existed within Computer Science
42:49 - Education the technology industry at
42:51 - large um and just curious to hear from
42:54 - the panelists in terms of you know both
42:56 - both the opportunities that that are
42:57 - presented which I think you were just
42:58 - touching on hottie but also um there are
43:00 - risks to to equity um you know with past
43:03 - technological innovations uh that have
43:06 - widened Equity gaps and so uh definitely
43:08 - a concern of of everyone here I know um
43:10 - so just your thoughts on on the risks
43:13 - the opportunities um of AI as it relates
43:15 - to CS education and equity in CS
43:19 - education I can start on this one um I
43:21 - just wanted to um point to what hadti
43:24 - said about gener helping create access
43:28 - accessibility to um coding in terms of
43:31 - ensuring that students have more time
43:33 - for the deeper thinking and planning and
43:36 - computational thinking and less time on
43:38 - the more rotary tasks involved in coding
43:41 - I think that's a great Point um I'd add
43:43 - to it that we're starting to see the
43:45 - potential for genev AI in helping
43:48 - students who may face barriers to
43:50 - traditional learning methods um that
43:52 - that can gen can be a tool in helping
43:55 - individualize learning um in terms of
43:58 - risks um as as luden the question we
44:01 - already have um Equity gaps and Cs and
44:04 - an AI specifically our own data from
44:07 - LinkedIn earlier this year shows that in
44:09 - the AI field um it is still very over
44:13 - represented by men for example 70% male
44:16 - to 30% female um and it is so important
44:20 - that um these roles are diverse um to
44:23 - ensure that the impacts of AI Tech
44:26 - technology um that there are no negative
44:28 - impacts for underrepresented groups so
44:30 - this is a really critical point um the
44:33 - last thing I'll say on this is that our
44:35 - research at LinkedIn looks at um the
44:37 - overall impact of AI on the workforce um
44:40 - think Patrick you alluded to it in in
44:42 - the introduction of our report um and
44:45 - what we're seeing is that women and
44:47 - younger workers are over represented in
44:50 - jobs that stand to see the most
44:52 - immediate impacts of gen on their jobs
44:55 - um so it's really important that um
44:57 - computer science students and
44:59 - professionals who are working on this
45:00 - technology are also thinking about those
45:02 - impacts and that educators are thinking
45:05 - about how to um train and teach future
45:08 - Generations in the workforce on learning
45:11 - skills um as their jobs May evolve with
45:15 - Gen
45:17 - technology so uh yeah I'm very concerned
45:21 - about like how do we make sure this is
45:23 - going to narrow gaps rather than make
45:26 - them bigger and I think there are a lot
45:27 - of reasons to worry about perhaps the
45:30 - gaps getting bigger um prior to being at
45:33 - NSF I uh talk computer science uh at
45:36 - Duke University in North Carolina for 19
45:39 - years and one of the things we saw is
45:43 - just the impact of Preparatory privilege
45:46 - right if you have prior experience in
45:49 - what that means in terms of what you're
45:52 - able to do when you get there and that
45:55 - could be become even larger with access
45:58 - to these tools and we're even seeing
46:00 - some places where uh there are things
46:03 - happening in high schools that really
46:06 - are making things worse for example at
46:08 - one school they uh cut off access uh to
46:12 - uh chat GPT so you couldn't go through
46:14 - the school's uh computers but then the
46:17 - students who had the ability to tether
46:19 - to their phones were still able to get
46:21 - access to chat GPT so instead of
46:25 - actually trying to level the playing
46:26 - field what they did was uh allow folks
46:28 - who had access to hotpots to be able to
46:31 - do more um so uh don't do that um and uh
46:36 - but I do think there are great
46:38 - opportunities as well um we are seeing
46:42 - work where uh one of the big problems on
46:45 - the University level is capacity right
46:47 - we don't have enough capacity in terms
46:49 - of teaching assistants and professors to
46:51 - work with all the students and some uh
46:55 - there are already some uh Educators who
46:58 - are creating really good like uh helper
47:02 - Bots that do a much better job than
47:05 - honestly our taas and faculty were doing
47:07 - in terms of giving high quality
47:10 - immediate responses that help people
47:12 - with the problem that they're working on
47:15 - so uh I am hopeful but I do think that
47:18 - this is going to require a real
47:20 - dedication on everyone's part to make
47:22 - sure that we're narrowing the
47:24 - gaps
47:26 - I similarly see sort of both sort of
47:29 - risks and also opportunities but I'm way
47:30 - more optimistic about the opportunities
47:32 - and that's much more because I think
47:34 - about the longterm not necessarily the
47:36 - you know last year schools ban chat gbt
47:38 - which was I think a a big mistake I I
47:41 - suspect when we look 10 years from now
47:44 - the rise of all AI tools but especially
47:47 - generative AI is going to be something
47:49 - we look back as having been one of the
47:51 - greatest equalizers in education uh and
47:54 - the reason I say that first first of all
47:55 - is the access is increasingly going to
47:58 - be anybody who has a phone which is uh
48:00 - and phones already reach a very very
48:03 - large percentage of the global
48:04 - population and and that's only going to
48:06 - increase I also would say when I think
48:08 - about Equity I don't just think in the
48:09 - United States if you think globally
48:12 - there are places that just the entire
48:14 - country barely teaches computer science
48:16 - for example but access to a phone
48:18 - suddenly will have will provide you
48:19 - access to a personalized uh tutor and uh
48:24 - if you think about not just where CS is
48:26 - taught versus it's not taught that's
48:29 - going to be easier with with these new
48:31 - tools and then there's places where it's
48:33 - taught in places where it's taught
48:34 - poorly the quality of of education is
48:37 - also going to go up because more and
48:39 - more the as the role of the teacher
48:41 - becomes that of a coach or facilitator
48:43 - everybody will have an much higher
48:46 - quality sort of uh content experience
48:49 - and we already see that with the work
48:51 - that code.org has done for example part
48:52 - of why access to computer science is
48:55 - more equitable is the money we put into
48:56 - training teachers but part of it is
48:58 - because we've created a curriculum that
48:59 - allows a history teacher to begin
49:01 - teaching computer science uh because the
49:04 - history teacher doesn't need to be a CS
49:06 - expert because our curriculum and our
49:08 - videos and so on carry some of that
49:11 - weight and that has enabled an equitable
49:13 - spread of access when an AI tutor does
49:17 - even more than code.org videos or
49:18 - curriculums do that will actually
49:20 - increase the equity Equitable access and
49:23 - the it'll widen the the gap between
49:25 - those who do or don't have access to
49:27 - basic digital Hardware but I believe the
49:30 - more value we put into that digital
49:32 - Hardware the more our e our global
49:35 - economy is going to spread access as we
49:37 - see with smartphones the more powerful
49:39 - smartphones get the more people end up
49:41 - having them yeah thank you just
49:44 - completely agree with all the panelists
49:45 - there in terms of just this broader
49:46 - theme of the the great opportunities
49:49 - that do exist and uh for differentiated
49:51 - learning personalized learning um to to
49:54 - Really extend that opportunity to some
49:55 - more students uh and and appreciate you
49:57 - calling out you know the global
49:59 - considerations as well they're hottie um
50:02 - but while also being very cognizant and
50:04 - mindful of the um the risks of of
50:06 - widening gaps as well I think we've got
50:09 - time maybe just for one last question
50:11 - here uh before we call wrap up the panel
50:14 - um I want to talk a little bit about uh
50:16 - responsible Ai and just the the the role
50:18 - that CS education has to ensure that um
50:22 - and this kind of has two two elements to
50:24 - it both the responsible use of AI um but
50:27 - also the responsible development of AI
50:28 - systems um and you know for future AI
50:31 - developers out there and just kind of
50:33 - what role um you know foundational CS
50:35 - classes should play in in ensuring that
50:37 - that's part of the the curriculum or um
50:40 - more broadly as we think about CS
50:41 - education and the the um interplay of
50:44 - responsible use of Technology maybe at
50:45 - large uh not just AI but any any
50:47 - thoughts or reactions
50:52 - there um so uh NSF we're respons
50:55 - responsible for uh trying to broaden
50:58 - participation of the Computing research
51:01 - community and I think that becomes more
51:04 - important because we really need I mean
51:07 - these technologies have a much broader
51:09 - impact than they used to but I also
51:11 - wanted to say I'm seeing that this has
51:14 - been a great opportunity in that the
51:18 - impact of technology was always like
51:21 - meaningful and not necessarily always
51:24 - like you know nice and with AI it's
51:29 - foregrounded everyone wants to have a
51:32 - conversation about it because it's real
51:34 - easy to see the problems and everyone
51:37 - wants to have the discussions about
51:39 - ethics that before I think we a little
51:41 - abstract but now I think these are
51:44 - things that are impacting students lives
51:47 - impacting their fam's lives and people
51:49 - want to engage so I really think this is
51:51 - a great opportunity for us as a
51:54 - community
51:56 - just going to say that um you know I
51:58 - think definitely students should be
52:00 - learning responsible AI in terms of if
52:02 - they're going to be developing these
52:03 - Technologies pointing back to the
52:05 - diversity Stat or lack there of
52:07 - diversity in the AI field so that's
52:08 - really critical but also I'd say WID
52:11 - spread AI literacy um the broader
52:14 - understanding of what is this technology
52:16 - what are are the differential impacts
52:18 - what are the biases that may exist and
52:20 - being able to comprehend that so whether
52:22 - these students will go on to actually
52:25 - design these algorithms or be on the
52:27 - consumer side using them as hadti
52:29 - mentioned in Salesforce or in other
52:31 - software where they will be um I think
52:34 - that's also really
52:36 - critical so first of all I agree with
52:38 - Jeff that you know teaching about
52:39 - societal impacts has been a part of
52:41 - computer science in the last uh couple
52:44 - decades you know pre AI uh you know the
52:47 - csta standards for many years have
52:49 - included sort of learning about the
52:51 - societal impacts of Technology as part
52:53 - of learning computer science you know
52:55 - with with great power comes great
52:57 - responsibility and we should be teaching
52:59 - students not only what a computer could
53:01 - do but what it should do uh and with AI
53:04 - it is a superpower for anybody who has
53:06 - computer science skills AI basically
53:08 - doubles those skills and so it doubles
53:10 - the necessity of making sure we teach
53:12 - students how to use it at you know for
53:15 - for positive social impact and as
53:17 - Educators I would say when it comes to
53:19 - responsibility our responsibility to
53:21 - democratize access to this education is
53:24 - even greater
53:25 - because the the abilities of somebody
53:28 - who knows computer science have just
53:30 - basically increased generative AI coding
53:32 - has always been a superpower but coding
53:34 - with AI is now like a double or triple
53:36 - superpower and that's a superpower that
53:38 - needs to be in the hands of everybody uh
53:41 - we we none of us want a world where a
53:43 - very small percentage of of the
53:45 - population are creating the tools and
53:47 - technologies that everybody else are
53:48 - just blindly using we should all
53:51 - envision a society where every human
53:53 - being has the knowledge to to maximize
53:55 - their own personal potential as creators
53:58 - and that's our our number one
53:59 - responsibility as educators of computer
54:01 - science what a fantastic note to end on
54:04 - because we are at time thank you
54:06 - panelists appreciate you all thank you
54:08 - audience for your
54:11 - engagement I pass it back to
54:15 - Hannah all right let's give a hand up
54:17 - for that great panel
54:22 - everyone well so while this is the last
54:25 - time we're all going to be together in
54:27 - this room don't leave yet we have two
54:29 - great sessions still happening this
54:31 - morning both at 10:00 a.m. and 11:00
54:32 - a.m. um including some really great
54:35 - lesson demos so please stay and enjoy
54:38 - that um if you've not yet picked up a
54:40 - hard copy of the state FCS report I
54:42 - don't know what you're waiting for we've
54:43 - got plenty out there I'll be sad if I
54:45 - have to take a lot home I don't want
54:47 - that so please make sure to swing by and
54:49 - grab that we also have state handouts uh
54:51 - so please uh grab one if you want to
54:53 - grab one for a colleague um as Josh
54:55 - mentioned this is such a crucial tool to
54:57 - Advocate uh so please take it home uh to
55:00 - your home community and and use it to
55:02 - get more computer science of have a few
55:04 - other housekeeping things uh check out
55:06 - of your rooms by 11: a.m. please we do
55:09 - not want the hotel to get mad at us we
55:11 - do have luggage storage downstairs right
55:13 - by the escalators in the St James room
55:15 - so if you need to run up quickly and
55:17 - grab your suitcase you can bring it down
55:18 - there um and we have several lost and
55:20 - found items some stray glasses some
55:22 - stray cords so make sure to swing by the
55:25 - registration desk to grab all of that
55:26 - but thank you so much for a wonderful CS
55:29 - edcon

Cleaned transcript:

everyone welcome to the final day of Cs edcon which is quite sad I know we've been having a great time together but I'm really excited uh to be your host MC for the last and best plenary of Cs edcon and we're going to be talking about the 2023 state of Cs report so if you already have your hard copy feel free to pull it out and follow along if you don't have it don't worry we have plenty left still at registration so I am excited uh to welcome up my coauthors so before I do that though my name is Hannah Weissman and I am the director of policy code.org and the author of the state of Cs report and I'm going to be joined on stage by two of my great coauthors so BT from the computer science Teachers Association and Josh Childs from esep so I'll be talking a little bit about uh my section of the report and then I'll turn it over to them uh so we will give you guys a great overview and you're again take it out and follow along so our big headline this year is that 2023 is the biggest year of growth since 2018 so well over half of high schools in the country now have access to foundational computer science and when you see where we started in 2018 that is amazing progress and we should all feel incredibly proud of that so many more students have access to computer science than they did just five years ago and while we don't have data from 10 years ago would would be even worse 10 years ago so we've made so much progress um but I know that uh we're all a little competitive as well so we like the national number but we also like to see uh state facts as well so you can see that there really is a big range um in the country there's still states that have a minority of their schools offering computer science all the way to states that have almost every one of their high schools offering computer science um this map is in the book along with a lot of other ways to to see where your state ranks and and see what your neighbors are up to importantly as well just because computer science is offered doesn't necessarily mean that students are taking it so we are so excited this year to see that there are more students than ever before enrolled in computer science and so we have over 700,000 high school students taking computer science importantly we actually don't get data from every state so this number is even higher if we were to get data from all 50 states we also this year for the first time got data from a ton of States about middle school computer science so so many of us in this room right we know that early exposure is crucial we don't want the first computer science opportunity to be when a student is in ninth grade and so we had data from 19 States this year that almost 350,000 students were taking computer science that Middle School level and again if we had data from every state those numbers would be even higher so you can see in the state of Cs report there's a map that shows which states gave us data this year if your state is not included please reach out talk to your policy makers talk to your Department of Education we want to get data from every state it's so crucial for us to have that data to keep everyone accountable to be achieving our goals and really making sure that every student has uh both the ability to participate and then it's actually enrolled it's not just enough that they have a course offer but we we actually want to see all students enrolled in computer science and so with such tremendous growth in progress this year some of us might be asking how how did that happen and it's it's not a coincidence it's thanks to so many of us in this room here and a lot of it is due to policies right this doesn't happen overnight this is sustained Statewide commitment and effort and so these are the 10 policies recommended by the code.org aacy Coalition many of you in this room are a part of that advocacy Coalition and while I'm not going to go through all of these policies what they do is they make sure that there's the capacity to teach computer science they make sure there's developed and strong leaders at the school and administrative level and they make sure that students have access and that there is equity for all students taking computer science I do want to call out that this year the code.org absy Coalition added our 10th policy which is recommending that every state Implement a graduation requirement we have seen that even when students have the opportunity to take computer science they do not all enroll particularly our young women are economically disadvantaged students so graduation requirement means that every student has an opportunity uh an introductory computer science experience and then hopefully they go on to take more and continue exploring computer science so again we love a good map we love some competition so here you can see uh the policy adoption across state and one of the things that's really exciting that we passed a few years ago is that every state now has at least one policy promoting computer science at the Statewide level and that is really crucial to making sure that this doesn't uh disappear in a few years that it is part of the state's education ecosystem and you can see that we have several states that have all of our policies which is really exciting and just like how we're hoping to get every High School offering computer science we want every state on this map to be that dark blue so just to give you some quick um highlights from this past year we have 10 states that have nine or more policies and these states it's not a coincidence these states have really high access and they have high participation because their states have committed and invested uh at the state level uh to policies that ensure that their teachers and students are well prepared to succeed in computer science we also have three states this year that joined our five other states in having a computer science graduation requirements that's North Carolina North Dakota and Rhode Island So within the next five years all these states will be requiring uh to graduate high school to take a computer science course this year we had five states pass firsttime funding and that is so crucial because we see that once you pass funding for the first time it's so much easier to continue funding computer science to continue investing on the state level so we had Illinois Louisiana Michigan my home state of Minnesota uh and New Hampshire this year and that contributed to more money than ever before being allocated to Computer Science Education so we had over 120 million and that's just at the state level that doesn't include any federal grants any money um from private or matches and so more money than ever been before has been flowing in to ensure that our teachers are well equipped and our students are prepared and excited for computer science now every year right we want we want to keep it interesting we don't want to have the same old thing every year so among the many new things in the report this year um is looking at the data uh by school size and so as some of you may be aware we actually have so many small high schools in this country over 50% of the high schools that are in this country are actually under 500 students and what we discovered this year is that it is so much harder for these high schools uh to be teaching computer science and so if we look at this graph here small high schools are student high schools with 500 students or less medium schools are uh between 500 and 1200 students and large schools are 1200 students or more so if we look at the large Schools they're almost all teaching computer science if a student is going to a school with more than 1,200 students they very very likely have access to computer science but that's contrasted with that most of the students at small high schools are not having access to computer science so when we think about that nationally we're at about 57 and a half% to get to that 100% % almost all of our work is going to be in small schools and as I mentioned for some of you who are at my session two days ago this is not just a rural issue there are small schools in urban areas Suburban areas rural areas these are public schools these are uh Charter Schools all of these schools need additional resources and help uh to get computer science offered we know that in these schools teachers often wear many hats um there might be less resources and so we really need to double down and invest to ensuring that students at these schools have access and are able to enroll and computer science I'm going to turn it over to BT now who's going to dig way more into the data with you all um and then uh talk about what we can do with that thanks Hannah yeah give it up for Hannah uh it's a pleasure to be here and to see you all again I'm BT from the computer science Teachers Association um and we have a lot to celebrate as Hannah just shared and I also want to share some things for us to reflect on and hopefully motivate us because we have some persistent Equity gaps who want to discuss first with regards to access which means offering a foundational high school computer science course um this chart shows access by student race and ethnicity and the labels are small but the first four I'll highlight are Native American Alaskan black latinx a native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander and they are all less likely to have access to CS at their High School than their uh white and Asian peers and I should also the the good news is all of these bars have risen over the last couple of years so we are making some steady progress here I also want to highlight that these numbers are different than participation which means enrollment in a course for example the first chart the first bar on the left side is 67% of Native Americans have access to high school CS far fewer actually participate in CS that's one of our biggest gaps and there's a phenomenal report from capore Center in Asus just released I'd recommend you read it to learn more about this Equity Gap uh we're going to transition talking about participation so participation is instead enrollment in those High School CS courses and this chart shows enrollment um disagreed by race and ethnicity and over the last three years participation by race ethnicity has been fairly consistent the kind of dark green bar shows the national demographics of that group and the light green bar shows their enrollment in high school CS courses and we see across these that nationally black native Hawaiian multiracial students and white students are proportionately represented to their enrollment in the schools Asian students are over represented and latinx and Native American and Alaskan students are underrepresented and in fact latinx students are pretty likely to attend a high school that offers computer science but they are far less likely to enroll in it there's a strong uh participation Gap here latinx students are 1.4 times less likely than their white indan peers to take foundational CS in high school another persistent Gap is with girls only 31% of young women are enrolled in high school computer science this has been the same over the last few years what that also means is with relative race and ethnicity parity but this gender gap we know that girls of color are most impacted they have that double bind and that means they're far less likely to enroll in CS there are other inequities Beyond race ethnicity gender school size uh so some to highlight some of these other subgroups we know that multilingual Learners students with disabilities and economically disadvantaged students are all underrepresented compared to their representation in the school in FAL computer science um some good news the efforts to teach computer science at the K levels have led to less pronounced disparities and this is true across all or most of the trends and one example is with gender so we just showed that 31% of uh girls enroll in high school CS in middle school that number is 44% and in elementary school it's 49% so we see far closer to parity and these group these numbers give an incomplete story and that's because we can see where CS is offered we have data around who takes it but we don't yet know at scale what that experience is like for them because really it matters the interactions between students stents and their teachers so in the report you'll find a number of quotes and stories embedded throughout that try to paint a better picture about what is driving that work and I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the incredible work of the K12 teachers that lead to these changes and are disrupting inequities and are creating inclusive environments for their students that lead them to want to to continue to pursue CS um so I want to take a moment to thank those teachers yeah let's do that um and as the world's largest CS department csda is here to support them and help connect them to other teachers so we welcome you to join our department as well as invite teachers to do the same uh now I'm to turn over to Josh he's going to talk about how to use a report thanks be thanks BT appreciate it and we appreciate the partnership that we have with code.org and csta when it comes to producing this report uh group of us last night went to dinner and then to the sphere how many of y'all went to the sphere or went to some show there we go look at the hands raised and it reminded me or uh really helped me to really double down the fact that CS matters CS education matters and all of us in the room are committed to seeing its growth seeing sustained and seeing more and more students and their families and communities getting impacted and access and participating in computer science and so as thinking about how do we use this report after you've flipped through the pages I don't know about you when you get a nice new book or report I like to sniff it a little bit get that new smell in me what next how do we use it and so I think about the student this the name of the session is the state of Cs in 2030 so I'm thinking that student right now who's in their room or in the classroom they're designing some kind kind of robotic dog or dingo that may go to Google or Microsoft or NSF one day and say I want to fund something like this that could help address and answer some problems that are in society right now so how do we think about this report for what we want to see in the future with cs education well for one you all have a hard copy that you got to registration Hannah said there's more that you can get uh later on there's also a pdf online that you can provide the stakeholders and folks back at home to know more about the data in their state and about the national landscape around CS education including State handouts about your individual State and word it ranks in comparison to other states to a similar size and scope there's also a very unique and very cool data dashboard that's online that provides filters ways in which to access data based on different demographics and your local school so dig into that and you can find that at advocacy. code.org stateof Cs and as you think about this work as we leave Las Vegas later today or tonight on the red eyee how do we think about the work when it comes to expanding capacity how do we think about the work in CS when it comes to access for students how do we think about participation in CS for our students in our schools and most importantly what's the experience of Cs education for students around our country and so thinking of this framework that it guides our work in esep developed by my colleague Carol Fletcher and jce Warner at the University of Texas how do we think think about this work and our work where we're trying to impact what happens in CS classrooms around the country so now after this session after we go home this is where we kick in this is where our advocacy kicks into high gear to seeing the what we want to see in CS education so we got to identify who our audience is that's Educators that's policy makers that's industry leaders and community members students families small business owners all of those that are impacted or impact computer science and so thinking about how will you tailor your message and your message and your group's message in the back to the relevant audience that you want to see engaged in in computer science and most importantly who needs to know more about this report and the data that's embedded within the report and online and in the dashboard to help Advance this work further and then finally how do we Advocate it's not enough to keep what we have gained over the last two and a half days inside our head but how do we Advocate to that community and to that audience once we leave out of these doors and down those convention steps well first you got to ask the question how will you use the data in this report to make sense of the disparities that BT talked so wonderfully about in computer science second what actions and this says team but I want to flip that a little bit what actions will you take to address these disparities that we known about that you've heard over and over again not just here but in other conferences I know it's how our CSS folks work right we go from one week to the next week we gather at State Summit some other week we'll get together at another place right we hear the same thing over and over again so what are we going to do differ when we walk out of this room with this year's report and then finally how will you engage individuals from underrepresented populations to develop strategies in collab cation together not just for them but with them to address some of these deep disparities that we see in CS education again thank you to our partnership with code.org and the computer science Teachers Association for this work I want to give credit to the other Co coauthor who's sitting in the audience Sarah dudon who I get to work with every day I'm G turn it back over to Hannah that all right thank you so much Josh and BT um you know 20 minutes is not enough to talk about a report that took us months to write uh but it's a little a little sneak peek for you all so we have put our contact information up here because the report is the beginning of a conversation please reach out to us we want to hear from you how are you using the report how can we make it better for future years this is a a product of a collaborative Community we want that conversation to continue uh so please I look forward to emails in my inbox uh hopefully not this weekend but maybe next week um so you know there was one other thing that we didn't mention and it wasn't an accident because I didn't want to steal the Thunder from the next folks um but one of the other things that is new this year in the report is AI right we've been talking so much about AI the last few days and how that impacts education but particularly how that impacts Computer Science Education right that is why we're all here and thinking about how we can best equip our teachers and students in computer science education and that includes AI so that iscl included in the report it's mentioned the executive summary in the introduction and it actually has its own section this year where it talks about the changing landscape and some guidelines and Frameworks for States and policy makers so that leads me to introducing the next part of our panel and I'm so excited to welcome on to the stage Patrick oin he is going to be the moderator of the next panel and they're going to be talking all about Ai and how that's going to impact uh the future of Computer Science Education so Patrick I'll welcome you on up to the stage I good morning let's hear it one more time for Hannah BT Josh congratulations on the release of the state ofcs report such a hugely impactful resource for our community and uh really taking to heart that that call to action in terms of you know leveraging this as a resource to go out in the work that we're doing as we leave Las Vegas um um so thank you for that um so yeah I'm Patrick oin I'm director of teacher skills within Microsoft philanthropies we're focused at Microsoft philanthropies on empowering nonprofits and communities with digital and AI capabilities to really Drive inclusive economic growth and So within that team I'm focused and my team is focused on teacher Skilling and so we do that through efforts whether that's free content resources Partnerships with nonprofit organizations like code.org csta csforall and others represented here um and supporting teachers in areas of Cs education AI cyber security and sustainability so just wanted to introduce myself for for folks that I haven't had the opportunity to meet yet so you have a little bit more context on on myself um so I have the privilege of moderating this panel of course we've been talking throughout the week about the impact of AI on education r large and the impact of AI on the workforce um but we haven't had as much of a kind of focused conversation on the impact of AI on CS education specific Al what is the future of Cs education in the context of AI in education what role does CS education play in teaching students to uh learn about how to use AI how to create with AI how to create AI Technologies and also how to do so responsibly and with the ethical impacts of computing uh on society in mind so lots to unpack there we have a fantastic panel lined up three uh individuals with varied perspectives and uh backgrounds that I think we're going to have a great Focus discussion here so first up I'd like to call to the stage Janna de philippus who is the senior program manager for public policy and economic graph at LinkedIn welcome Janna next up we have Jeff Forbes who is the program director for education and Workforce at nsf's uh directorate for computer and information sciences and Engineering I think I got that right please correct me if I miss messed that up and perhaps doesn't need an introduction but I will do so uh nonetheless the cofounder and CEO of code.org hadti partovi welcome hadti all right so I have a range of different questions here some of which I'm GNA ask to to individual panelists others I'll just open it up to to any of you to respond to and we can kind of uh build off the conversation from from one another um there's a chance we may have some opportunity for for questions in the audience although this this panel is a little bit more abbreviated than some of the other plenary panel sessions that we've had uh so so we'll just kind of monitor the time and see what's what's possible but I'd like to start with uh Janna in terms of um you know your work at LinkedIn and the work that your team does you recently published a report back in August um around the future of work uh as it relates to AI the AI impact on future work in a variety of different um uh spaces whether that's the roles that will be impacted how they might be impacted um different skills and how that plays into it so I think really just centering this question around skills and so what what are we hearing or seeing or learning from industry as it relates to the the skills that are needed around uh Ai and specific to CS thank you Patrick and it's great to be here today um let me start by saying that on LinkedIn we're seeing that AI skills are in high demand and growing fast job postings mentioning AI Tech like gbt or chat gbt have shot up 2 one times since this time last year um we're also seeing a high demand for AI skills and Technical roles like software engineer and data scientist the top AI skills we're seeing on the platform include um the software Library tensor flow or the python package pandas as well as some more General AI skills like um data structures or algorithm development um the fastest growing AI skills we're seeing include computer vision classific ation and natural language processing among among others um it's important to note that even for AI jobs so jobs that have ai in the title like AI engineer or head of AI um or require multiple AI skills on their job postings we're seeing a pretty even mix of technical skills and these AI skills specifically as well as people skills or soft skills um skills like communication and ethics um so it would be really important when thinking about teaching um computer science students and preparing them for the workforce that they're getting an education that includes the mix of technical proficiency and some of these other capabilities yeah thanks for that I related to that interestingly I was um I was on a different panel a few months ago and kind of asked a related question and so as prepar preparation for that panel I had gone through uh on the Microsoft career site and just kind of done an informal look at um job descriptions for kind of junior level development positions and I was looking through the skills that were listed in there and so many of them are kind of more of those soft skills that you're talking about around communication collaboration and teamwork um but also being able to read and interpret code and uh things of that nature and and you know of course there's a little bit in there in terms of you know fundamental knowledge and understanding of these data structures algorithms Etc but a lot around like yeah interpretation of code working with others on code um being a key piece of that which I think is kind of reflected in in the report as well one question I have for the kind of the whole group to respond to is just kind of again in the space of thinking about um the skills that we want students to to gain from a a computer science class especially if we're thinking about computer science class in you know 2030 as it was mentioned like we're thinking about the state of Cs in in 2030 you know uh a point of conversation that's come up in this community and in CS education over the last several years is that CS is is more than just programming right there's computational thinking is core to uh to uh to computer science so computational thinking in particular curious to get reactions from from the panelists in terms of do you see that how we think about that evolving um in light of of uh generative AI technology if so how um and how how do we really ensure that students are growing those skills in particular um in the future of Cs so uh yeah I do think that this is a pretty big change and I particularly like what you said uh Patrick about reading code um one of the things uh computational thinking uh was uh first uh uh at termed I guess by our uh prior director from NSF who really wanted to think about you know what are the key things that everyone needs to learn in our society today given that how much computation drives everything and it's really amazing that like a lot of that still applies today but there has been a real big shift right and I think there's going to be even bigger shift as we go forward into 2030 uh one of the anecdotes I like is a tweet where someone said they saw someone in a cafe who was just programming on their laptop without using any AI code generation tools it's like what's the matter with this person it's like seeing someone mow along with scissors like what like what's going on but I do think um you know we do look at uh what's happening across the country and um while we code and trying to think about code and trying to do a lot of the other things we expect in competitional thinking are expected it's uh there's a whole lot more that's people trying to write code people trying to solve particular problems and I think we're going to see a lot more in getting back to a lot of the uh tenants of competitional thinking you know what are how do we decompose problems how do we think about the impact of what's Happening how do we uh how are we able to ask questions about the data that we have and then know whether those answers are correct I think there's a lot that we're going to learn as we move forward uh with our new great tools hi everybody I have a lot of thoughts on this question so I don't know how to answer briefly um the first thing I want to say relative to what J shared about the skills on LinkedIn is I think you know today's job descriptions about AI talk about specific AI skills for an AI job uh but when it comes to the types of jobs people post on LinkedIn we are quickly moving to the point where every single job will have an expectation that you use AI because every single software tool out there is going to be adopting some form of AI so if you use Salesforce as a salesperson Salesforce is going to be using AI to pregenerate emails that you send to people uh if you use Photoshop as a graphic designer that already now has generative Ai and it's going to be almost redundant to say that you need to know how to use the AI aspects of Photoshop and using AI is going to be part of basic digital literacy but when we think about computer science in AI there's probably the greatest change um you know people have done surveys of of folks asking what Industries or What professions are going to be the most impacted by generative AI number one is software engineering number two is teaching so the combination of teaching and computer science is sort of at this Vortex of change because it both involves changing what we teach and involves changing how we teach it uh and both of those things are are quite relevant um the and what i' also want to add is that generative AI is just a part of an evolution and is a fast moving Target so just thinking around how does what we have seen in the last 12 months impact CS education for 10 years from now isn't enough because there's going to be this ongoing effort by the people creating these AI tools to add a greater level of critical thinking problem solving reasoning removing bias removing misinformation all the flaws we currently see there's somebody or teams of people working to remove those flaws uh and so it's going to be challenging and keep up with that but what is definitely clear is that the rot work of sort of coding is going to be reduced and the more sort of computational thinking work of break down problems or abstraction those are going to be increased uh even though code.org is called code.org uh as people who use our platform know that almost all the coding we teach is using blocks um using the blockly language which is how you learn the algorithmic thinking and ignore frankly or never even see the syntax because the syntax is going to be increasingly less important uh and So within CS education teaching how AI works and using that a AI to to solve problems is is going to rise in importance um the actual nittygritty of where did the semicolon go and you close your parentheses those are going to be less and less the things we deal with which I actually think makes programming much much more accessible uh and focuses on things like the creativity and the things that engage humans rather than the things that make it sort of nerdy and difficult yeah great insights thank you perhaps we'll see even kind of more block coding to your point there as as we get into to you know visioning to 2030 where the emphasis on introduction to computer science really leverages that even more as a a way to teach those uh computational thinking algorithmic thinking as well um and I like your point too hottie in terms of the impact on on teaching and software engineering and and and to to kind of build into that uh some of the conversations that have also come up that doesn't mean that that teachers and software Engineers necessarily are losing their job it's changing how those jobs are uh are working and that's I think an important point to to underscore as well um my next question is for Jeff um specifically and it's around just kind of if there's any early research just within your your work stream that you've seen uh into the use of generative AI in the highered space you know at the the maybe cs1 uh intro level CS courses where uh there's been experimentation with integration of of generative AI uh tools into those classes or any anything you've been hearing from that community of uh higher education faculty as it relates to lessons that that the K12 sector could could learn from yeah uh there're actually been a remarkable amount of work done over the past year it turns out uh and it's difficult because it is such a moving Target but I think some of the lessons that we get there was a uh uh working group at the international computer science conference and uh Computer Science Education conference excuse me uh and you know what did they find well you turns out these tools work right they work really well uh for introductory uh programming right so what do I mean when I say that they work well they help students uh complete the tasks they make sure they complete the task and their Solutions are better um they're of course able to do it in less time but what's also remarkable is that you would think well um they're not able to maybe understand as much as one might think but they've even had studies where uh they had a group of uh students aged 10 through 17 working on projects and half had access to uh AI code generation tools and half didn't um the ones who did have access to the AI uh generation tools of course you know did the assignments very well and did them quicker but also when they had to do things like code modification without the AI generation tool they did it just as well and when you ask them about uh doing the test not on the uh tool they did just as well in fact uh they in some cases uh did better especially if they this was a a camp that was in Python if they had prior scratch experience it turned out that that actually uh allowed them to use the tools even better now it is key that we think about how we teach in these environments right that it's not just about you know what we're teaching but how we teach and how we prepare to teach what the resources are that we're going to be providing students and there's been a lot of work on that and a lot of work also looking at how um faculty are trying to address these issues because as you can imagine there's a variety of levels of comfort with this right I imagine you all have to do an incredible amount to update uh a lot of the great tools that you already have out there that's asking a lot of uh curriculum developers are asking a lot of Faculty but I do think this is really an opportunity based on all the research that we're seeing that this does have a substantial impact um but it does appear that you still do want people to take these classes because the impact does get less the higher up the curriculum you're going right so now that may change because one of the things we're finding are the newer tools are better than the old tools but it does seem to be the case that you do want to learn some of these things because if you want to succeed in some of the later courses you do need uh currently at least uh to have gone through these introduction classes which have some of the same learning objectives before but now you're incorporating AI Tools in as one of the things that students and teachers are using yeah thanks for that Jee and I think kind of going up to the from highed to Industry there's actually been some interesting research that that GitHub has done related to the use of the GitHub copilot technology kind of code assistance technology uh leveraging generative Ai and they've found in their early research of developers that are using that tool that not only are they producing code more more quickly but there's also in terms of the sentiments of the developers that are using the tools that they're finding themselves more fulfilled by the work that they're doing because they're putting aside some of the more uh timec consuming menial tasks and able to focus their time on what really matters to them so kind of just building on some of the the pieces that you were seeing in the research at the higher ed space as well Jeff um curious to kind of zoom in like for this exercise of future of Cs in in 2030 and hotti I was particularly interested to get your perspective on this question of like if we're sitting in a in a computer science class you know seven years from now um what what do you think that would look like from a pedagogical perspective um you know what a lot of I think for most of us that have been in a computer science class or computer science teachers ourselves a lot of time spent students at their computers coding um do you expect that to to continue to be the case or how do you think uh things will will will evolve in that classroom setting uh in terms of instruction and pedagogy and just how students are spending their time I'm really curious to get your your thoughts on that I know you mentioned previously hottie in terms of like wrote work uh being reduced and there was a comment earlier from Jeff I think about like code reading more than code writing um so kind of pulling together a few threads curious to to get your your vision and thoughts there hottie um I didn't know this question was coming so I have to think about my answer and I also would say I don't want my answer to carry too much weight because I'm coming up with it right now this isn't like the sevenyear plan for code. Works work no worries any members of my team in the room this isn't like our our our sevenyear agenda um i' first say nobody knows exactly what things are going to be like in seven years I'm not sure at any point you could predict that but with this pace of change it's quite difficult uh so I can the things I'm most sure of are the trends I mentioned which is learning more about how AI works and learning more how to use Ai and learning less about rote repetitive stuff uh uh you know the reduction of rote and repetitive work in computer science isn't a new trend you know uh when my father was learning it computer science involved punching holes in cardboard you know and to represent ones and zeros uh and you know right before I went to college people were learning an assembly language because that was the the the primary way you learned and each decade typing code has become closer and closer to English uh and we're going to continue on that path um I expect blockbased programming will actually increase and you know syntactical coding will be will decrease because it'll be more like oh not everybody needs to do that um in fact I wouldn't be surprised if the generative tools for coding generate block looking stuff and you don't need to look at the stuff underneath because that's the part that the computer definitely has has done a better job of um uh one thing I think I mentioned a couple days ago I especially think HTML coding is going to drop in in sort of what you teach in a high school or middle school class because jobs in HTML coding are also going to just generally those are going to be things that tools like canva or other tools just automatically generate HTML for us uh in the same way that Assembly Language coding is not something people do um the the one thing I'd say that I'll probably you know every time I think about it slightly blows my own mind and I'm not sure whether this is in four years or seven years or 10 uh but if you if you try the current chat GPT audio like UI where you can speak to it and it speaks back and you're not typing it just it's speaking um that's already here today we're not very far from a point where your an AI teacher can be sort of a person that you speak to that looks like like a person it could even have the visuals of like it could be me you know somebody did a 3D scan of me in a in a measure of my voice or or you know any any celebrity or Tech leader or whatever that is your teacher and you speak to them and it speaks to you uh as it and this is not just in CS education all of Education there's this opportunity to have a real AI tutor not like a chat bot that types and you need to read what it says uh and I suspect we'll see things like that before the end of this decade how that impacts all of Education uh I'm certain that the role of a teacher will continue to become more of a facilitator and a coach and the role of a curriculum developer is going to be more of using this kind of AI to basically uh not just deliver information but deliver interactive teaching and coaching and that's going to be wild in its impacts but I think it'll increase equity and it'll give a a much broader set of people access to the best educators thank you yeah sorry to put you on the spot there with that one but I appreciate the answer and agree in terms of the the pace of change and how much that's impacting the entire education community and um how you know we all here in this room and and others other leaders in education CS education Ai and education really need to support the community in adapting to to these technological changes um to support our students um you mentioned Equity there at the end HTI I just want to kind of Bring It uh conversation to that that space for the the whole panel to respond to as as you choose um you know we saw from the state of Cs report uh that there's been improvements in there's uh in terms of equity and access um some some lags in some cases uh that were called out in terms of participation so obviously we're all well familiar with uh the the persistent e Equity gaps that have existed within Computer Science Education the technology industry at large um and just curious to hear from the panelists in terms of you know both both the opportunities that that are presented which I think you were just touching on hottie but also um there are risks to to equity um you know with past technological innovations uh that have widened Equity gaps and so uh definitely a concern of of everyone here I know um so just your thoughts on on the risks the opportunities um of AI as it relates to CS education and equity in CS education I can start on this one um I just wanted to um point to what hadti said about gener helping create access accessibility to um coding in terms of ensuring that students have more time for the deeper thinking and planning and computational thinking and less time on the more rotary tasks involved in coding I think that's a great Point um I'd add to it that we're starting to see the potential for genev AI in helping students who may face barriers to traditional learning methods um that that can gen can be a tool in helping individualize learning um in terms of risks um as as luden the question we already have um Equity gaps and Cs and an AI specifically our own data from LinkedIn earlier this year shows that in the AI field um it is still very over represented by men for example 70% male to 30% female um and it is so important that um these roles are diverse um to ensure that the impacts of AI Tech technology um that there are no negative impacts for underrepresented groups so this is a really critical point um the last thing I'll say on this is that our research at LinkedIn looks at um the overall impact of AI on the workforce um think Patrick you alluded to it in in the introduction of our report um and what we're seeing is that women and younger workers are over represented in jobs that stand to see the most immediate impacts of gen on their jobs um so it's really important that um computer science students and professionals who are working on this technology are also thinking about those impacts and that educators are thinking about how to um train and teach future Generations in the workforce on learning skills um as their jobs May evolve with Gen technology so uh yeah I'm very concerned about like how do we make sure this is going to narrow gaps rather than make them bigger and I think there are a lot of reasons to worry about perhaps the gaps getting bigger um prior to being at NSF I uh talk computer science uh at Duke University in North Carolina for 19 years and one of the things we saw is just the impact of Preparatory privilege right if you have prior experience in what that means in terms of what you're able to do when you get there and that could be become even larger with access to these tools and we're even seeing some places where uh there are things happening in high schools that really are making things worse for example at one school they uh cut off access uh to uh chat GPT so you couldn't go through the school's uh computers but then the students who had the ability to tether to their phones were still able to get access to chat GPT so instead of actually trying to level the playing field what they did was uh allow folks who had access to hotpots to be able to do more um so uh don't do that um and uh but I do think there are great opportunities as well um we are seeing work where uh one of the big problems on the University level is capacity right we don't have enough capacity in terms of teaching assistants and professors to work with all the students and some uh there are already some uh Educators who are creating really good like uh helper Bots that do a much better job than honestly our taas and faculty were doing in terms of giving high quality immediate responses that help people with the problem that they're working on so uh I am hopeful but I do think that this is going to require a real dedication on everyone's part to make sure that we're narrowing the gaps I similarly see sort of both sort of risks and also opportunities but I'm way more optimistic about the opportunities and that's much more because I think about the longterm not necessarily the you know last year schools ban chat gbt which was I think a a big mistake I I suspect when we look 10 years from now the rise of all AI tools but especially generative AI is going to be something we look back as having been one of the greatest equalizers in education uh and the reason I say that first first of all is the access is increasingly going to be anybody who has a phone which is uh and phones already reach a very very large percentage of the global population and and that's only going to increase I also would say when I think about Equity I don't just think in the United States if you think globally there are places that just the entire country barely teaches computer science for example but access to a phone suddenly will have will provide you access to a personalized uh tutor and uh if you think about not just where CS is taught versus it's not taught that's going to be easier with with these new tools and then there's places where it's taught in places where it's taught poorly the quality of of education is also going to go up because more and more the as the role of the teacher becomes that of a coach or facilitator everybody will have an much higher quality sort of uh content experience and we already see that with the work that code.org has done for example part of why access to computer science is more equitable is the money we put into training teachers but part of it is because we've created a curriculum that allows a history teacher to begin teaching computer science uh because the history teacher doesn't need to be a CS expert because our curriculum and our videos and so on carry some of that weight and that has enabled an equitable spread of access when an AI tutor does even more than code.org videos or curriculums do that will actually increase the equity Equitable access and the it'll widen the the gap between those who do or don't have access to basic digital Hardware but I believe the more value we put into that digital Hardware the more our e our global economy is going to spread access as we see with smartphones the more powerful smartphones get the more people end up having them yeah thank you just completely agree with all the panelists there in terms of just this broader theme of the the great opportunities that do exist and uh for differentiated learning personalized learning um to to Really extend that opportunity to some more students uh and and appreciate you calling out you know the global considerations as well they're hottie um but while also being very cognizant and mindful of the um the risks of of widening gaps as well I think we've got time maybe just for one last question here uh before we call wrap up the panel um I want to talk a little bit about uh responsible Ai and just the the the role that CS education has to ensure that um and this kind of has two two elements to it both the responsible use of AI um but also the responsible development of AI systems um and you know for future AI developers out there and just kind of what role um you know foundational CS classes should play in in ensuring that that's part of the the curriculum or um more broadly as we think about CS education and the the um interplay of responsible use of Technology maybe at large uh not just AI but any any thoughts or reactions there um so uh NSF we're respons responsible for uh trying to broaden participation of the Computing research community and I think that becomes more important because we really need I mean these technologies have a much broader impact than they used to but I also wanted to say I'm seeing that this has been a great opportunity in that the impact of technology was always like meaningful and not necessarily always like you know nice and with AI it's foregrounded everyone wants to have a conversation about it because it's real easy to see the problems and everyone wants to have the discussions about ethics that before I think we a little abstract but now I think these are things that are impacting students lives impacting their fam's lives and people want to engage so I really think this is a great opportunity for us as a community just going to say that um you know I think definitely students should be learning responsible AI in terms of if they're going to be developing these Technologies pointing back to the diversity Stat or lack there of diversity in the AI field so that's really critical but also I'd say WID spread AI literacy um the broader understanding of what is this technology what are are the differential impacts what are the biases that may exist and being able to comprehend that so whether these students will go on to actually design these algorithms or be on the consumer side using them as hadti mentioned in Salesforce or in other software where they will be um I think that's also really critical so first of all I agree with Jeff that you know teaching about societal impacts has been a part of computer science in the last uh couple decades you know pre AI uh you know the csta standards for many years have included sort of learning about the societal impacts of Technology as part of learning computer science you know with with great power comes great responsibility and we should be teaching students not only what a computer could do but what it should do uh and with AI it is a superpower for anybody who has computer science skills AI basically doubles those skills and so it doubles the necessity of making sure we teach students how to use it at you know for for positive social impact and as Educators I would say when it comes to responsibility our responsibility to democratize access to this education is even greater because the the abilities of somebody who knows computer science have just basically increased generative AI coding has always been a superpower but coding with AI is now like a double or triple superpower and that's a superpower that needs to be in the hands of everybody uh we we none of us want a world where a very small percentage of of the population are creating the tools and technologies that everybody else are just blindly using we should all envision a society where every human being has the knowledge to to maximize their own personal potential as creators and that's our our number one responsibility as educators of computer science what a fantastic note to end on because we are at time thank you panelists appreciate you all thank you audience for your engagement I pass it back to Hannah all right let's give a hand up for that great panel everyone well so while this is the last time we're all going to be together in this room don't leave yet we have two great sessions still happening this morning both at 1000 a.m. and 1100 a.m. um including some really great lesson demos so please stay and enjoy that um if you've not yet picked up a hard copy of the state FCS report I don't know what you're waiting for we've got plenty out there I'll be sad if I have to take a lot home I don't want that so please make sure to swing by and grab that we also have state handouts uh so please uh grab one if you want to grab one for a colleague um as Josh mentioned this is such a crucial tool to Advocate uh so please take it home uh to your home community and and use it to get more computer science of have a few other housekeeping things uh check out of your rooms by 11 a.m. please we do not want the hotel to get mad at us we do have luggage storage downstairs right by the escalators in the St James room so if you need to run up quickly and grab your suitcase you can bring it down there um and we have several lost and found items some stray glasses some stray cords so make sure to swing by the registration desk to grab all of that but thank you so much for a wonderful CS edcon
