A function is pretty much a sequence of instructions
00:04 - to perform a specific task.
00:06 - Basically if you're building a car,
00:08 - what you want the car to do is what a function is.
00:11 - Turn right, you want to turn left,
00:12 - you want it to drive, you want it to stop.
00:15 - All those could be functions.
00:17 - Now that we're back with our farmer,
00:18 - we're going to start learning how to define functions.
00:20 - You'll notice in your workspace
00:22 - that there's a block that has a star in the corner.
00:24 - This is a function definition.
00:26 - At the top line of the block it tells us the name of the function.
00:30 - The blocks inside of it tell us what it does.
00:32 - This definition sits in the workspace,
00:34 - but our farmer won't do the actions
00:36 - inside the function, until we drag out the function block.
00:40 - To do that, we need to click on the functions category in the menu
00:43 - and drag out the "fill 5" function.
00:46 - Let's put the fun back into functions!
