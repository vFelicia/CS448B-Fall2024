00:19 - hi
00:21 - hello
00:23 - hi everyone and welcome to code bytes
00:25 - in today's lesson
00:27 - we're going to visit a fictional place
00:29 - called monster town where a virus
00:31 - outbreak is about to happen we'll be
00:33 - using computer science to understand how
00:35 - quickly a virus can spread and what can
00:37 - be done to slow it down and help all the
00:39 - monsters get healthy again my name is
00:41 - mike harvey and i'm a curriculum
00:43 - development manager at code.org and this
00:45 - here with me is taylor my sidekick and
00:48 - co-programmer for today you want to say
00:50 - hi taylor hi everyone i am in sixth
00:53 - grade i'm 11 years old and i've been
00:55 - coding for around four years now
00:58 - most of my most recent projects that
01:00 - i've been doing is
01:01 - learning how to make and code web pages
01:04 - excellent thanks for sharing that taylor
01:06 - now this week as you already know we're
01:09 - celebrating the hour of code and
01:11 - millions of students are learning basic
01:13 - computer science our code just passed
01:16 - 1 billion student engagements reaching
01:18 - students in every city and every country
01:20 - around the world we're joined today by
01:22 - all of you and so many other students
01:24 - that want to learn to code in this huge
01:26 - global classroom
01:28 - and it looks like even more students are
01:29 - joining us as we speak we have actually
01:32 - a little map that some of you may have
01:33 - had a chance to go and flag yourselves
01:35 - on so let's see if we can pull that up
01:37 - and see where people are calling from
01:39 - today
01:41 - so take a look at this taylor this is
01:42 - where all the people who are joining
01:44 - code bites today are coming from
01:47 - so we've got people all over the united
01:48 - states and we've got people out in in
01:50 - europe and asia as well too we even get
01:52 - somebody up in alaska
01:54 - uh taylor and i are calling from uh our
01:57 - homes in maine today which is up in the
02:00 - northeastern united states uh it's 11
02:03 - a.m here but it could be earlier or
02:05 - later depending on where you live
02:08 - okay so now getting to the episode for
02:10 - today
02:11 - but we're going to do three things today
02:13 - we're going to learn to code naturally
02:16 - and we're going to do that in a really
02:17 - fun tool called sprite lab
02:18 - we're going to be creating an outbreak
02:20 - simulator using events now if you
02:23 - watched code bites yesterday you had the
02:25 - chance to program your own dance party
02:27 - and that activity also used events so
02:29 - you'll have a little bit of a head start
02:31 - there don't worry if you weren't there
02:32 - for the episode yesterday we're going to
02:34 - let you know everything you need to know
02:35 - today
02:36 - finally we're going to learn how
02:37 - simulations can help us understand the
02:39 - world around us
02:41 - now
02:42 - feel free today if you want to just
02:44 - watch and learn with taylor and i you
02:46 - can do that or if you want to try and
02:47 - follow along at the same time you can do
02:49 - so by going to code.org
02:52 - outbreak
02:53 - and that will bring you right to the
02:54 - same activity that taylor is going to be
02:56 - going through on her computer screen
02:58 - right now
03:00 - so taylor
03:01 - uh taylor's going to get us started
03:03 - today by telling us a little bit about
03:05 - monster town and what's been happening
03:06 - there so do you want to go ahead and
03:08 - share your screen and and give us the
03:10 - lowdown what's going on in monster town
03:13 - monster town was usually a happy and
03:14 - healthy place the monsters in monster
03:17 - town love to wander around to visit
03:19 - their friends
03:20 - one day one of the monsters started
03:22 - feeling sick the monster had caught a
03:25 - virus
03:26 - a virus is a tiny germ that can make you
03:28 - sick
03:29 - the other monsters were not too worried
03:31 - so they kept visiting their friends
03:34 - soon after two more monsters got sick it
03:37 - was the same virus it seems they got the
03:39 - virus from their friend
03:42 - the virus slowly spread to the other
03:44 - monsters who were nearby the healthy
03:46 - monsters began to worry that they were
03:47 - all going to get sick
03:49 - the sick monsters began to worry that
03:51 - they were going to give the virus to
03:52 - everyone else
03:54 - stopping the spread fortunately after
03:57 - studying the virus the neighbors of
03:59 - monster town made an important discovery
04:01 - they realized that they were less likely
04:03 - to spread the virus if they were masks
04:05 - over their mouths with face masks on
04:07 - sick monsters were less likely to give
04:09 - the virus to healthy monsters
04:11 - all right thanks taylor so that was a
04:14 - that worked really well as a story but
04:16 - one of the great things about computer
04:17 - science is that we can actually make
04:19 - monster town come alive by writing some
04:21 - code so as i said a minute ago we're
04:23 - going to build a simulation of that
04:25 - story that taylor just read using sprite
04:27 - lab
04:28 - so taylor you want to go ahead and click
04:30 - continue we'll go on to the the next
04:31 - step here
04:33 - okay so once it's loaded uh
04:37 - let's see what we've got here
04:39 - okay so just a little bit of quick
04:41 - orientation here there's a big green
04:43 - square on the left uh and that is our
04:47 - space where the simulation is actually
04:49 - going to run yeah and you can actually
04:50 - stretch that out with those little dots
04:52 - that's a good idea maybe make it a
04:53 - little bit bigger
04:54 - and then in the middle of the screen
04:56 - there's a gray box that's our toolbox
04:58 - and if you click on those three labels
04:59 - there you'll see there's some different
05:01 - blocks inside you can kind of see what's
05:03 - going on there and then finally this big
05:05 - white area on the right is is our
05:07 - workspace right and that's where we're
05:08 - going to be writing the code
05:11 - uh taylor where'd you go do you want to
05:12 - turn your camera back on too so we can
05:14 - we can see you while you're you're
05:15 - coding i think you can uh leave your
05:18 - screen on as well at the same time is
05:20 - that possible or is it one or the other
05:23 - i don't know okay well let's make sure
05:25 - we can see your screen i can't see that
05:26 - anymore okay okay
05:32 - okay we'll we'll go with it like this
05:34 - then all right so
05:36 - let's see what we need to do first we're
05:38 - going to see if we can start putting
05:39 - together the pieces of the simulation
05:41 - and taylor you're you're in the driver's
05:43 - seat for writing the actual code that
05:45 - we're going to need
05:46 - so to make monster town come alive the
05:48 - first thing that we're going to need are
05:49 - sprites and
05:51 - sprites well what are they taylor do you
05:53 - have any idea what what sprites are
05:56 - sprites are almost like our characters
05:58 - well they are our characters essentially
06:00 - but um our sprites are essentially what
06:03 - we're going to be using in this
06:05 - experiment to like demonstrate what's
06:07 - going on in monster time
06:09 - yeah great and if you're using like a
06:11 - computer game you might think of sprites
06:13 - as being like the the characters or the
06:15 - obstacles or the things that you're
06:16 - trying to collect anything like that the
06:18 - little images that are that are
06:19 - controlled by the code so we need 10
06:22 - uh sprites that are going to represent
06:24 - the healthy monster those are the purple
06:25 - ones so let's bring that block out and
06:27 - connect it underneath
06:29 - okay and just like that they appear and
06:32 - unfortunately we also need one monster
06:34 - that's going to be six so we're going to
06:35 - represent that monster
06:37 - with another sprite that has a different
06:39 - costume we call these little pictures
06:41 - that that show up for each sprite as
06:44 - costumes and that's going to be a really
06:46 - important way for understanding how the
06:48 - simulation is actually working
06:50 - they're pretty big is there anything
06:51 - that we can do to make them smaller
06:54 - i was just thinking the same thing
06:55 - they're looking kind of crowded so let's
06:57 - take a look at and see if there are any
06:58 - other blocks there that we can use to
07:00 - change their size what are you seeing
07:03 - this one might look like it is going to
07:05 - do it okay so it says set all size to
07:08 - 50. yeah let's bring that one out in
07:09 - this case 50 means 50 so it should
07:12 - change them to about half their size
07:14 - yeah that's going to give them a little
07:15 - bit more room
07:16 - it's looking pretty good and there's one
07:19 - really important thing that i feel like
07:20 - isn't happening yet they're not really
07:22 - uh moving at all
07:24 - so that's the last thing that we want to
07:26 - to do here to get this really feeling
07:29 - like a simulation instead of just a
07:31 - picture so
07:33 - yeah we have this block that says uh all
07:34 - sprites begin wandering in sprite lab we
07:37 - can control our sprites with behaviors
07:38 - like wandering and that'll make them
07:40 - start to do things all on their own so
07:42 - if we snap that let's see
07:46 - okay now what do you need to do what are
07:48 - you doing there you hit the run button
07:51 - around the screen as you can see yeah
07:54 - you're wandering around the screen just
07:55 - like that okay awesome
07:57 - why don't you uh stop screen sharing for
07:59 - a second so we can we can talk to
08:00 - everybody about the next thing that uh
08:02 - that we're gonna need to understand to
08:04 - keep on going
08:06 - so there's a computer programming
08:08 - concept that i mentioned earlier that
08:09 - we're gonna need to keep going with this
08:11 - this project and that's called an event
08:17 - oh that's great great sign there
08:19 - yeah an event so when we code a computer
08:22 - program we can ask the computer to
08:24 - change what the computer does when the
08:26 - user like clicks with their mouse
08:28 - or types a letter on their keyboard
08:31 - each button click or key pressed is
08:33 - called an event an event could also be
08:35 - when something else happens like like
08:37 - two things touching on the screen
08:39 - we're going to use this concept of well
08:41 - we can use this concept of events all
08:42 - the time as people too when we respond
08:45 - to different signals like for example uh
08:48 - i've been enjoying taking my dogs out
08:50 - for for hikes and when i'm walking down
08:52 - a trail if i see other people coming
08:54 - that's like a signal that reminds me to
08:57 - make sure that my my mask is on straight
08:59 - uh just to be you know respectful and
09:02 - courteous to others
09:03 - so it's kind of me responding to
09:05 - something else that's happening so
09:08 - audience we have a quick question for
09:09 - you you're going to need your clicker
09:10 - fingers in in just a moment here we're
09:12 - going to put a poll up on the screen
09:14 - uh to see what you think so computer
09:16 - scientists
09:17 - need events if they want to change
09:19 - certain things to happen in response to
09:21 - other actions or to make programs more
09:23 - interactive
09:24 - which of these do you think is an
09:26 - example of an event
09:29 - all right we're going to give you just a
09:30 - few more seconds to answer the choices
09:32 - are going to a birthday party singing in
09:35 - a school concert or tapping an icon to
09:37 - open an app taylor do you think you have
09:40 - a guess which one might be the the right
09:41 - answer personally i think you'll be
09:43 - probably tapping an icon on the app
09:46 - all right let's close the poll and see
09:47 - what the audience said
09:49 - well most people agreed with you
09:51 - although it's it's interesting to see
09:52 - things like birthday party and school
09:54 - concert don't we sometimes think of
09:56 - those as being events too
09:59 - when we're not talking about computer
10:00 - science those would be great examples of
10:02 - events
10:03 - in computer science when we say event
10:05 - usually what we mean is that idea of
10:07 - like something happening in response to
10:09 - something else so in this case
10:11 - when you tap the icon on your smartphone
10:14 - the app opens up and so that's the kind
10:16 - of event that we're talking about here
10:19 - all right so
10:20 - let's see if we can take this idea back
10:23 - to sprite lab
10:24 - uh taylor you want to share your screen
10:26 - again and move on to the next level
10:41 - all right and once it loads
10:45 - okay great so we want to make something
10:48 - happen
10:49 - when a healthy monster touches a sick
10:51 - son a sick monster well maybe i don't
10:54 - mean we want something to happen but we
10:55 - need something to happen for this
10:56 - simulation uh taylor what do you think
10:59 - should happen when
11:01 - when this healthy monster touches the
11:03 - sick monster
11:04 - i think we should definitely have
11:06 - um the healthy monster get turned sick
11:09 - or
11:10 - well if the sick monster touches the
11:12 - healthy monster i feel that they should
11:14 - get turned to be sick i guess
11:16 - yeah it's kind of strange saying like we
11:18 - want that to happen maybe we don't want
11:20 - that to happen but that's that's what is
11:21 - happening that's the thing we're trying
11:22 - to model with this simulation right and
11:25 - i'm noticing there are a couple of new
11:26 - blocks of code down at the bottom we
11:28 - have this block that says when touches
11:30 - this is a new event block
11:33 - and it says when the healthy monster
11:35 - touches the sick monster
11:37 - now it looks like the next block of code
11:39 - that we need is is all ready to go did
11:40 - you already do that quickly
11:43 - uh it says
11:45 - change oh change costume that block
11:47 - right there
11:49 - now remember before we were saying that
11:51 - the costumes are the really the thing
11:52 - that that makes the simulation work and
11:55 - so when we change the costume of the
11:57 - monster it changes the appearance but it
11:59 - also changes what kind of happens in the
12:02 - simulation
12:03 - so we don't want all the healthy
12:05 - monsters to get sick we just want the
12:07 - subject of that event the one that
12:08 - actually did the touching so this code
12:11 - is exactly what we need already um what
12:14 - should happen differently now taylor
12:17 - um when we run the simulation the
12:19 - monsters should
12:20 - if it works the way it's supposed to um
12:23 - the monsters should um
12:25 - the stick monster when it touches a
12:26 - healthy monster this the healthy monster
12:28 - should as you can see in the block turn
12:31 - to a sip monster okay let's let's give
12:33 - it a try let's run that and see if your
12:35 - prediction
12:36 - is what happens
12:38 - see them wandering around
12:42 - oh there we go
12:44 - what did you notice
12:45 - none of them are starting to get sick as
12:46 - you can see on the screen but
12:49 - the it's
12:50 - as more and more it's like it's harder
12:52 - to control
12:53 - um just like monsters from getting
12:55 - healthy once they're sick okay cool all
12:58 - right now hang on here for a second uh
13:00 - now audience if you've done coding
13:02 - before you might have done like a
13:04 - tutorial where you're going through and
13:05 - solving puzzles if you get the right
13:07 - code you finish the puzzle you move on
13:09 - to the next one i want to just point out
13:11 - that what we're doing today is really
13:12 - pretty different we're running a
13:14 - simulation and the thing that's really
13:16 - cool about simulations is they don't
13:17 - happen exactly the same way every single
13:19 - time
13:20 - so
13:21 - we're not going to hit continue quite
13:22 - yet what we're going to do is keep
13:23 - playing we're going to run the
13:24 - simulation again and see if we can start
13:26 - to notice any patterns so taylor why
13:28 - don't we why don't you walk us through
13:29 - running this a couple of times
13:31 - and
13:32 - uh just give us give everybody your
13:34 - thoughts on what's happening is it same
13:36 - this time or is it a little different
13:39 - um
13:41 - it's similar but i um
13:43 - with the coding as you can see as the
13:45 - monsters go if there's healthy monsters
13:47 - and clumps and they go and the sick
13:49 - monster touches one of the healthy
13:50 - monsters they can get sick as they kind
13:53 - of modeled in the in the beginning of
13:54 - when we first started doing this
13:57 - activity
13:58 - yeah
13:59 - great let's let's run it one more time
14:02 - and hit keep playing and reset it one
14:03 - more time
14:04 - yeah i i heard you just say that when
14:07 - the healthy monsters are kind of clumped
14:09 - all together that they can get sick much
14:11 - more quickly
14:13 - this kind of reminds me of real life a
14:15 - little bit too where we know that like
14:17 - larger groups are can potentially
14:21 - get each other sick more quickly than
14:23 - people who are who are spread out
14:25 - all right
14:26 - so good news the simulation is working
14:29 - it's doing what you expected it to do
14:31 - bad news the monsters are just getting
14:33 - sick and there's no way we can make them
14:35 - better yet or is there i think we're
14:37 - ready to continue taylor why don't we
14:39 - see if we can help them out i remember
14:41 - you read the story at the beginning of
14:43 - the episode and you were telling us
14:44 - about a discovery that maybe could help
14:47 - the monsters of monster town could you
14:49 - remind everybody what that was
14:51 - yeah maybe um
14:53 - the monsters sense we can kind of relate
14:55 - this to real life maybe we could help
14:57 - stop the spread by maybe putting some
14:59 - masks on the sick monsters or even the
15:01 - healthy monsters
15:03 - yeah okay great so it looks like there's
15:05 - some extra code here
15:07 - um
15:09 - taylor i'm thinking
15:12 - actually it looks like you might have
15:13 - already added some of the code that we
15:15 - need can can we um
15:18 - just like we're just going to back this
15:19 - up real quick just so that we can have
15:21 - everybody see what you are doing
15:24 - because i think your your code from when
15:26 - you practice this was already there so
15:28 - actually
15:29 - do you see the purple stripe in the
15:30 - middle of the screen where it says
15:31 - workspace and then there's a version
15:32 - history button can you just tap on that
15:34 - version history button
15:36 - and then hit start over
15:40 - yeah there we go okay this is what what
15:41 - we'll see at the beginning it's
15:43 - refreshing
15:46 - sorry about that that's okay
15:48 - all right so now let's take a look and
15:50 - see what new blocks are are in the
15:52 - workspace if you scroll down
15:54 - okay cool
15:56 - uh so
15:57 - we have these new other new blocks that
16:00 - say when clicked so that's another kind
16:03 - of an event that can happen when the
16:05 - user clicks on something on their
16:07 - computer screen like a sprite so taylor
16:09 - can you since you had a chance to
16:10 - practice this earlier can you walk us
16:12 - through how we can use these new event
16:14 - blocks to give the monsters masks
16:16 - um
16:17 - when
16:18 - there's if you see like right here we
16:20 - could put we press the little plus
16:22 - button and there's a little box here
16:24 - that you can actually use in um
16:27 - these
16:28 - where is it there we go just a little
16:31 - messy um
16:33 - so there's the blocks and then you can
16:34 - take the blocks and you can actually add
16:36 - them to the different pieces of code to
16:38 - make it so when something's touched
16:40 - it um
16:43 - clears that block
16:44 - and when something's tapped
16:46 - it will change to
16:48 - the
16:50 - different things so i think we might
16:52 - actually be missing a block here yeah we
16:54 - need that change costume block again
16:56 - don't we similar to the
16:58 - third round we use the um
17:02 - the the block here to make it so that
17:06 - when that help the stick monsters touch
17:07 - the healthy monsters they got sick same
17:09 - block
17:11 - yeah so and but in this case we're going
17:13 - to change the monsters
17:15 - from what they were to
17:17 - a monster that has a mask on can you see
17:19 - there's like that little white face mask
17:21 - that they're wearing there we go all
17:23 - right and one more
17:33 - now these event blocks you can kind of
17:35 - drag them wherever you need to in your
17:36 - workspace to make space
17:39 - there we go
17:40 - okay so let's see what you've got now it
17:42 - says on the left it says when the
17:44 - healthy monster is clicked change the
17:46 - clicked healthy monster costume to
17:49 - a healthy monster with a mask on and
17:51 - then we have the kind of the same idea
17:53 - happening on the right but for
17:55 - stick monsters
17:56 - did the block disappear
17:58 - sorry my cat just deleted it somehow
18:03 - sorry about that
18:05 - let's get the um when clicked block
18:07 - instead of the wind touches block that's
18:09 - the one that we need
18:15 - yeah you can pull those two apart
18:17 - and then under events
18:21 - the one we need the one that went
18:23 - missing
18:24 - is that bottom one
18:26 - so bring that out and just change the
18:28 - the costume on that block to a sick
18:31 - monster
18:35 - in the green part of the block taylor
18:37 - yeah right there change that to the
18:38 - second costume there okay perfect that's
18:40 - the one that went missing i'm sorry
18:42 - oh that's that's okay
18:44 - we all have to uh
18:46 - deal with well some of us have to deal
18:48 - with cats and other distractions when
18:50 - we're trying to learn remotely it's just
18:52 - a new challenge this year
18:54 - okay so let's let's run this uh and
18:58 - we want to go kind of quickly since
18:59 - we're a little bit short on time so
19:01 - let's run this a couple times
19:03 - and now taylor what are you doing with
19:04 - your mouse as you're running the
19:06 - simulation i'm clicking on the sick
19:08 - monsters right now and as and
19:11 - now then since they have masks on they
19:13 - are not infecting our healthy monsters
19:15 - but we can actually put the masks and
19:17 - the healthy monsters as well
19:19 - okay cool
19:21 - now you did that pretty quickly and it
19:23 - seemed to help the the spread of the
19:25 - virus
19:26 - because you put masks on them kind of
19:28 - right away and only four monsters got
19:29 - sick if we tried this again and let's
19:32 - say
19:33 - uh run it and this time wait until like
19:35 - half the monsters get sick and then
19:37 - start putting on masks do you think
19:38 - anything different would happen
19:40 - i think if we waited as you can see
19:42 - right now um the monsters as you as you
19:45 - can see are going to are getting sick
19:47 - and if i start
19:49 - a little bit later when these monsters
19:51 - get sick it's gonna be harder
19:53 - to
19:54 - get um
19:56 - the other monsters to get them sick get
19:58 - them with masks on because then they
20:01 - a bunch of them will get infected faster
20:02 - and then it's harder to put masks on
20:04 - them when a bunch are injected yeah
20:07 - i i've
20:08 - i think we've heard that from from
20:10 - scientists too that like when something
20:12 - like this happens it's really important
20:14 - that we all work together quickly to try
20:16 - to to bring things under control and
20:18 - even though this simulation is pretty
20:19 - simple it is showing us that that idea
20:22 - that the faster we we act uh the better
20:26 - the the outcome
20:27 - we also saw earlier that the idea of
20:29 - like clumping the sprites together how
20:31 - that could could uh change the way that
20:34 - things work out too
20:36 - uh so this this simulation is pretty
20:38 - simple and basic it's only like what 10
20:40 - lines of code but we can even learn some
20:42 - things from it
20:44 - now we're
20:45 - a little bit short on time if you've got
20:47 - to go uh that's that's totally okay
20:50 - audience but uh for those of you who are
20:52 - able to stick around we got a couple
20:53 - quick uh wrap up questions for you so
20:56 - now in this activity we programmed using
20:59 - events so let's think about other
21:01 - scenarios that that work the same way
21:04 - and taylor you can stop screen sharing
21:06 - now okay great and we're going to put up
21:08 - a quick poll so which of these might be
21:11 - controlled by
21:13 - events uh and the choices are going to
21:15 - come up yep soon first choice playing
21:18 - the same game three times in a row
21:21 - second choice when someone gets tagged
21:23 - that player becomes it
21:25 - and third a baseball team practicing
21:27 - before a tournament
21:29 - all right
21:30 - and you've only had a little bit of time
21:32 - to answer but look at that 78 percent of
21:34 - people are in agreement that when
21:36 - someone gets tagged that player becomes
21:38 - it it's kind of like the simulation that
21:40 - we just saw too right where something
21:41 - changes about one of those objects when
21:44 - something happens and that's an exact uh
21:47 - connection to how events work when
21:49 - you're
21:50 - when you're doing computer science all
21:52 - right one more question we also created
21:55 - a simulation today of the virus outbreak
21:57 - at monster town so last question how can
22:00 - simulations be helpful in the real world
22:04 - choices are simulations can help us
22:06 - understand the world around us
22:08 - simulations let you test out ideas
22:10 - quickly cheaply and safely and
22:12 - simulations are a way to model complex
22:14 - systems in an interactive way
22:17 - what do you think taylor do you have any
22:19 - uh guesses here
22:21 - i think simulations can help us
22:24 - i think of all of these are kind of
22:26 - accurate but for me i think it's
22:28 - probably simulations can help us the
22:30 - world around us because
22:32 - well it kind of feeds into the other
22:34 - questions
22:35 - because
22:36 - because the world around us you can use
22:38 - the simulations to test out ideas
22:40 - and
22:41 - you can use them to like also test stuff
22:44 - and use complex systems in like an
22:46 - interactive way let's let's see what
22:47 - people thought
22:49 - isn't this interesting it's uh what i'm
22:51 - seeing is it's about a third
22:53 - a very evenly spread you know what this
22:55 - is a trick question because all of these
22:57 - answers are valid these are all
22:59 - potential benefits of simulation so no
23:01 - matter what you picked you picked
23:02 - something good in this case everybody so
23:04 - it's a nice job now that's the end of
23:06 - our show for today
23:08 - um and i want to give a big thank you to
23:10 - you taylor for for joining and being
23:12 - such a great co-teacher with me uh
23:14 - everybody that's been joining us on the
23:15 - call we hope you'll finish this tutorial
23:17 - yourself too remember it's code.org
23:20 - outbreak
23:21 - you can go even further than we did and
23:23 - continue improving your models and
23:24 - simulations by the time you finish
23:26 - you'll be able to share your creation
23:28 - with friends and family or even share a
23:29 - message about how to stay healthy when
23:31 - an outbreak happens in your town
23:35 - we hope that you'll continue joining us
23:38 - for code bites episodes um one last real
23:41 - fast quick thing just for fun that we
23:43 - thought we'd share taylor and i have
23:45 - have known each other for a little while
23:46 - because
23:48 - about three years ago i was one of her
23:49 - teachers when she was in third grade and
23:51 - you might remember that she mentioned
23:53 - that she's been uh learning computer
23:55 - science ever since and has been working
23:56 - on uh learning how to make a web page
23:58 - taylor i wondered if you could just take
24:00 - it like
24:01 - 30 seconds or less and just show us what
24:03 - you've been working on
24:04 - yeah i mean of course
24:07 - this is kind of an example of like how
24:09 - um computer science can help make our
24:11 - world like a better place i guess but um
24:13 - this is the website that i created and
24:15 - here's on like a bigger scale
24:18 - i created a website um
24:20 - yeah recently and
24:22 - this is just one example of things that
24:24 - you can do but um
24:26 - on the left there's the code and
24:32 - and then on the right is the the result
24:34 - and so you decided to make a page with
24:35 - things you can do to contribute to
24:37 - helping to save the planet that's such
24:39 - an amazing project taylor and i thank
24:41 - you for sharing that uh on that theme
24:44 - tomorrow's episode of code bytes if
24:46 - you're interested in in this topic like
24:48 - taylor is we really hope that you'll
24:50 - join if you if you if you can because
24:52 - we're going to be learning about how to
24:53 - create apps for good and uh
24:57 - and that's like just just a great
24:59 - example of of the kinds of things that
25:01 - we can do with computer science so
25:03 - thanks for watching everybody uh if
25:05 - you're on social media just a quick
25:08 - plug use the hashtags our code and
25:10 - codebyte so that we can see what you
25:11 - post okay now thanks for helping out
25:13 - today taylor you want to say bye to
25:15 - everybody on the call hi everyone thank
25:17 - you for coming out
25:19 - all right
25:20 - thanks everyone take care
25:28 - [Music]
25:44 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hi hello hi everyone and welcome to code bytes in today's lesson we're going to visit a fictional place called monster town where a virus outbreak is about to happen we'll be using computer science to understand how quickly a virus can spread and what can be done to slow it down and help all the monsters get healthy again my name is mike harvey and i'm a curriculum development manager at code.org and this here with me is taylor my sidekick and coprogrammer for today you want to say hi taylor hi everyone i am in sixth grade i'm 11 years old and i've been coding for around four years now most of my most recent projects that i've been doing is learning how to make and code web pages excellent thanks for sharing that taylor now this week as you already know we're celebrating the hour of code and millions of students are learning basic computer science our code just passed 1 billion student engagements reaching students in every city and every country around the world we're joined today by all of you and so many other students that want to learn to code in this huge global classroom and it looks like even more students are joining us as we speak we have actually a little map that some of you may have had a chance to go and flag yourselves on so let's see if we can pull that up and see where people are calling from today so take a look at this taylor this is where all the people who are joining code bites today are coming from so we've got people all over the united states and we've got people out in in europe and asia as well too we even get somebody up in alaska uh taylor and i are calling from uh our homes in maine today which is up in the northeastern united states uh it's 11 a.m here but it could be earlier or later depending on where you live okay so now getting to the episode for today but we're going to do three things today we're going to learn to code naturally and we're going to do that in a really fun tool called sprite lab we're going to be creating an outbreak simulator using events now if you watched code bites yesterday you had the chance to program your own dance party and that activity also used events so you'll have a little bit of a head start there don't worry if you weren't there for the episode yesterday we're going to let you know everything you need to know today finally we're going to learn how simulations can help us understand the world around us now feel free today if you want to just watch and learn with taylor and i you can do that or if you want to try and follow along at the same time you can do so by going to code.org outbreak and that will bring you right to the same activity that taylor is going to be going through on her computer screen right now so taylor uh taylor's going to get us started today by telling us a little bit about monster town and what's been happening there so do you want to go ahead and share your screen and and give us the lowdown what's going on in monster town monster town was usually a happy and healthy place the monsters in monster town love to wander around to visit their friends one day one of the monsters started feeling sick the monster had caught a virus a virus is a tiny germ that can make you sick the other monsters were not too worried so they kept visiting their friends soon after two more monsters got sick it was the same virus it seems they got the virus from their friend the virus slowly spread to the other monsters who were nearby the healthy monsters began to worry that they were all going to get sick the sick monsters began to worry that they were going to give the virus to everyone else stopping the spread fortunately after studying the virus the neighbors of monster town made an important discovery they realized that they were less likely to spread the virus if they were masks over their mouths with face masks on sick monsters were less likely to give the virus to healthy monsters all right thanks taylor so that was a that worked really well as a story but one of the great things about computer science is that we can actually make monster town come alive by writing some code so as i said a minute ago we're going to build a simulation of that story that taylor just read using sprite lab so taylor you want to go ahead and click continue we'll go on to the the next step here okay so once it's loaded uh let's see what we've got here okay so just a little bit of quick orientation here there's a big green square on the left uh and that is our space where the simulation is actually going to run yeah and you can actually stretch that out with those little dots that's a good idea maybe make it a little bit bigger and then in the middle of the screen there's a gray box that's our toolbox and if you click on those three labels there you'll see there's some different blocks inside you can kind of see what's going on there and then finally this big white area on the right is is our workspace right and that's where we're going to be writing the code uh taylor where'd you go do you want to turn your camera back on too so we can we can see you while you're you're coding i think you can uh leave your screen on as well at the same time is that possible or is it one or the other i don't know okay well let's make sure we can see your screen i can't see that anymore okay okay okay we'll we'll go with it like this then all right so let's see what we need to do first we're going to see if we can start putting together the pieces of the simulation and taylor you're you're in the driver's seat for writing the actual code that we're going to need so to make monster town come alive the first thing that we're going to need are sprites and sprites well what are they taylor do you have any idea what what sprites are sprites are almost like our characters well they are our characters essentially but um our sprites are essentially what we're going to be using in this experiment to like demonstrate what's going on in monster time yeah great and if you're using like a computer game you might think of sprites as being like the the characters or the obstacles or the things that you're trying to collect anything like that the little images that are that are controlled by the code so we need 10 uh sprites that are going to represent the healthy monster those are the purple ones so let's bring that block out and connect it underneath okay and just like that they appear and unfortunately we also need one monster that's going to be six so we're going to represent that monster with another sprite that has a different costume we call these little pictures that that show up for each sprite as costumes and that's going to be a really important way for understanding how the simulation is actually working they're pretty big is there anything that we can do to make them smaller i was just thinking the same thing they're looking kind of crowded so let's take a look at and see if there are any other blocks there that we can use to change their size what are you seeing this one might look like it is going to do it okay so it says set all size to 50. yeah let's bring that one out in this case 50 means 50 so it should change them to about half their size yeah that's going to give them a little bit more room it's looking pretty good and there's one really important thing that i feel like isn't happening yet they're not really uh moving at all so that's the last thing that we want to to do here to get this really feeling like a simulation instead of just a picture so yeah we have this block that says uh all sprites begin wandering in sprite lab we can control our sprites with behaviors like wandering and that'll make them start to do things all on their own so if we snap that let's see okay now what do you need to do what are you doing there you hit the run button around the screen as you can see yeah you're wandering around the screen just like that okay awesome why don't you uh stop screen sharing for a second so we can we can talk to everybody about the next thing that uh that we're gonna need to understand to keep on going so there's a computer programming concept that i mentioned earlier that we're gonna need to keep going with this this project and that's called an event oh that's great great sign there yeah an event so when we code a computer program we can ask the computer to change what the computer does when the user like clicks with their mouse or types a letter on their keyboard each button click or key pressed is called an event an event could also be when something else happens like like two things touching on the screen we're going to use this concept of well we can use this concept of events all the time as people too when we respond to different signals like for example uh i've been enjoying taking my dogs out for for hikes and when i'm walking down a trail if i see other people coming that's like a signal that reminds me to make sure that my my mask is on straight uh just to be you know respectful and courteous to others so it's kind of me responding to something else that's happening so audience we have a quick question for you you're going to need your clicker fingers in in just a moment here we're going to put a poll up on the screen uh to see what you think so computer scientists need events if they want to change certain things to happen in response to other actions or to make programs more interactive which of these do you think is an example of an event all right we're going to give you just a few more seconds to answer the choices are going to a birthday party singing in a school concert or tapping an icon to open an app taylor do you think you have a guess which one might be the the right answer personally i think you'll be probably tapping an icon on the app all right let's close the poll and see what the audience said well most people agreed with you although it's it's interesting to see things like birthday party and school concert don't we sometimes think of those as being events too when we're not talking about computer science those would be great examples of events in computer science when we say event usually what we mean is that idea of like something happening in response to something else so in this case when you tap the icon on your smartphone the app opens up and so that's the kind of event that we're talking about here all right so let's see if we can take this idea back to sprite lab uh taylor you want to share your screen again and move on to the next level all right and once it loads okay great so we want to make something happen when a healthy monster touches a sick son a sick monster well maybe i don't mean we want something to happen but we need something to happen for this simulation uh taylor what do you think should happen when when this healthy monster touches the sick monster i think we should definitely have um the healthy monster get turned sick or well if the sick monster touches the healthy monster i feel that they should get turned to be sick i guess yeah it's kind of strange saying like we want that to happen maybe we don't want that to happen but that's that's what is happening that's the thing we're trying to model with this simulation right and i'm noticing there are a couple of new blocks of code down at the bottom we have this block that says when touches this is a new event block and it says when the healthy monster touches the sick monster now it looks like the next block of code that we need is is all ready to go did you already do that quickly uh it says change oh change costume that block right there now remember before we were saying that the costumes are the really the thing that that makes the simulation work and so when we change the costume of the monster it changes the appearance but it also changes what kind of happens in the simulation so we don't want all the healthy monsters to get sick we just want the subject of that event the one that actually did the touching so this code is exactly what we need already um what should happen differently now taylor um when we run the simulation the monsters should if it works the way it's supposed to um the monsters should um the stick monster when it touches a healthy monster this the healthy monster should as you can see in the block turn to a sip monster okay let's let's give it a try let's run that and see if your prediction is what happens see them wandering around oh there we go what did you notice none of them are starting to get sick as you can see on the screen but the it's as more and more it's like it's harder to control um just like monsters from getting healthy once they're sick okay cool all right now hang on here for a second uh now audience if you've done coding before you might have done like a tutorial where you're going through and solving puzzles if you get the right code you finish the puzzle you move on to the next one i want to just point out that what we're doing today is really pretty different we're running a simulation and the thing that's really cool about simulations is they don't happen exactly the same way every single time so we're not going to hit continue quite yet what we're going to do is keep playing we're going to run the simulation again and see if we can start to notice any patterns so taylor why don't we why don't you walk us through running this a couple of times and uh just give us give everybody your thoughts on what's happening is it same this time or is it a little different um it's similar but i um with the coding as you can see as the monsters go if there's healthy monsters and clumps and they go and the sick monster touches one of the healthy monsters they can get sick as they kind of modeled in the in the beginning of when we first started doing this activity yeah great let's let's run it one more time and hit keep playing and reset it one more time yeah i i heard you just say that when the healthy monsters are kind of clumped all together that they can get sick much more quickly this kind of reminds me of real life a little bit too where we know that like larger groups are can potentially get each other sick more quickly than people who are who are spread out all right so good news the simulation is working it's doing what you expected it to do bad news the monsters are just getting sick and there's no way we can make them better yet or is there i think we're ready to continue taylor why don't we see if we can help them out i remember you read the story at the beginning of the episode and you were telling us about a discovery that maybe could help the monsters of monster town could you remind everybody what that was yeah maybe um the monsters sense we can kind of relate this to real life maybe we could help stop the spread by maybe putting some masks on the sick monsters or even the healthy monsters yeah okay great so it looks like there's some extra code here um taylor i'm thinking actually it looks like you might have already added some of the code that we need can can we um just like we're just going to back this up real quick just so that we can have everybody see what you are doing because i think your your code from when you practice this was already there so actually do you see the purple stripe in the middle of the screen where it says workspace and then there's a version history button can you just tap on that version history button and then hit start over yeah there we go okay this is what what we'll see at the beginning it's refreshing sorry about that that's okay all right so now let's take a look and see what new blocks are are in the workspace if you scroll down okay cool uh so we have these new other new blocks that say when clicked so that's another kind of an event that can happen when the user clicks on something on their computer screen like a sprite so taylor can you since you had a chance to practice this earlier can you walk us through how we can use these new event blocks to give the monsters masks um when there's if you see like right here we could put we press the little plus button and there's a little box here that you can actually use in um these where is it there we go just a little messy um so there's the blocks and then you can take the blocks and you can actually add them to the different pieces of code to make it so when something's touched it um clears that block and when something's tapped it will change to the different things so i think we might actually be missing a block here yeah we need that change costume block again don't we similar to the third round we use the um the the block here to make it so that when that help the stick monsters touch the healthy monsters they got sick same block yeah so and but in this case we're going to change the monsters from what they were to a monster that has a mask on can you see there's like that little white face mask that they're wearing there we go all right and one more now these event blocks you can kind of drag them wherever you need to in your workspace to make space there we go okay so let's see what you've got now it says on the left it says when the healthy monster is clicked change the clicked healthy monster costume to a healthy monster with a mask on and then we have the kind of the same idea happening on the right but for stick monsters did the block disappear sorry my cat just deleted it somehow sorry about that let's get the um when clicked block instead of the wind touches block that's the one that we need yeah you can pull those two apart and then under events the one we need the one that went missing is that bottom one so bring that out and just change the the costume on that block to a sick monster in the green part of the block taylor yeah right there change that to the second costume there okay perfect that's the one that went missing i'm sorry oh that's that's okay we all have to uh deal with well some of us have to deal with cats and other distractions when we're trying to learn remotely it's just a new challenge this year okay so let's let's run this uh and we want to go kind of quickly since we're a little bit short on time so let's run this a couple times and now taylor what are you doing with your mouse as you're running the simulation i'm clicking on the sick monsters right now and as and now then since they have masks on they are not infecting our healthy monsters but we can actually put the masks and the healthy monsters as well okay cool now you did that pretty quickly and it seemed to help the the spread of the virus because you put masks on them kind of right away and only four monsters got sick if we tried this again and let's say uh run it and this time wait until like half the monsters get sick and then start putting on masks do you think anything different would happen i think if we waited as you can see right now um the monsters as you as you can see are going to are getting sick and if i start a little bit later when these monsters get sick it's gonna be harder to get um the other monsters to get them sick get them with masks on because then they a bunch of them will get infected faster and then it's harder to put masks on them when a bunch are injected yeah i i've i think we've heard that from from scientists too that like when something like this happens it's really important that we all work together quickly to try to to bring things under control and even though this simulation is pretty simple it is showing us that that idea that the faster we we act uh the better the the outcome we also saw earlier that the idea of like clumping the sprites together how that could could uh change the way that things work out too uh so this this simulation is pretty simple and basic it's only like what 10 lines of code but we can even learn some things from it now we're a little bit short on time if you've got to go uh that's that's totally okay audience but uh for those of you who are able to stick around we got a couple quick uh wrap up questions for you so now in this activity we programmed using events so let's think about other scenarios that that work the same way and taylor you can stop screen sharing now okay great and we're going to put up a quick poll so which of these might be controlled by events uh and the choices are going to come up yep soon first choice playing the same game three times in a row second choice when someone gets tagged that player becomes it and third a baseball team practicing before a tournament all right and you've only had a little bit of time to answer but look at that 78 percent of people are in agreement that when someone gets tagged that player becomes it it's kind of like the simulation that we just saw too right where something changes about one of those objects when something happens and that's an exact uh connection to how events work when you're when you're doing computer science all right one more question we also created a simulation today of the virus outbreak at monster town so last question how can simulations be helpful in the real world choices are simulations can help us understand the world around us simulations let you test out ideas quickly cheaply and safely and simulations are a way to model complex systems in an interactive way what do you think taylor do you have any uh guesses here i think simulations can help us i think of all of these are kind of accurate but for me i think it's probably simulations can help us the world around us because well it kind of feeds into the other questions because because the world around us you can use the simulations to test out ideas and you can use them to like also test stuff and use complex systems in like an interactive way let's let's see what people thought isn't this interesting it's uh what i'm seeing is it's about a third a very evenly spread you know what this is a trick question because all of these answers are valid these are all potential benefits of simulation so no matter what you picked you picked something good in this case everybody so it's a nice job now that's the end of our show for today um and i want to give a big thank you to you taylor for for joining and being such a great coteacher with me uh everybody that's been joining us on the call we hope you'll finish this tutorial yourself too remember it's code.org outbreak you can go even further than we did and continue improving your models and simulations by the time you finish you'll be able to share your creation with friends and family or even share a message about how to stay healthy when an outbreak happens in your town we hope that you'll continue joining us for code bites episodes um one last real fast quick thing just for fun that we thought we'd share taylor and i have have known each other for a little while because about three years ago i was one of her teachers when she was in third grade and you might remember that she mentioned that she's been uh learning computer science ever since and has been working on uh learning how to make a web page taylor i wondered if you could just take it like 30 seconds or less and just show us what you've been working on yeah i mean of course this is kind of an example of like how um computer science can help make our world like a better place i guess but um this is the website that i created and here's on like a bigger scale i created a website um yeah recently and this is just one example of things that you can do but um on the left there's the code and and then on the right is the the result and so you decided to make a page with things you can do to contribute to helping to save the planet that's such an amazing project taylor and i thank you for sharing that uh on that theme tomorrow's episode of code bytes if you're interested in in this topic like taylor is we really hope that you'll join if you if you if you can because we're going to be learning about how to create apps for good and uh and that's like just just a great example of of the kinds of things that we can do with computer science so thanks for watching everybody uh if you're on social media just a quick plug use the hashtags our code and codebyte so that we can see what you post okay now thanks for helping out today taylor you want to say bye to everybody on the call hi everyone thank you for coming out all right thanks everyone take care you
