00:00 - so good morning everyone
00:02 - i'm thrilled to be here at this very
00:04 - special event
00:05 - and be here among students and educators
00:09 - administrators tech leaders celebrating
00:11 - something that just does not get enough
00:13 - attention that should get a lot more
00:16 - attention which is computer science
00:18 - education
00:20 - um so let me tell you my own story which
00:22 - in some ways is actually similar to
00:23 - peggy's story about how i developed my
00:26 - own passion for computer science
00:29 - so as a kid i was always doing creative
00:32 - projects drawing painting
00:34 - candle making
00:36 - mosaic making paper making you know all
00:39 - those favorite all those little art kits
00:41 - they sell in the store for kids i
00:43 - probably you know always wanted to do
00:45 - every single one of them
00:47 - the thing is i had never connected that
00:49 - computer science was actually a creative
00:52 - way of making
00:55 - services products
00:56 - that had the impact to change the world
00:59 - so
01:01 - what happened to me was i didn't pursue
01:03 - it i actually have a degree in history
01:05 - and literature
01:06 - and
01:07 - my senior year in college i
01:11 - by accident
01:12 - interned
01:13 - at a startup i actually worked for this
01:16 - temporary service i used to come home
01:18 - from college and say
01:20 - just send me wherever you want sometimes
01:22 - they send me to lawyers office doctor's
01:24 - offices everywhere and one time by
01:26 - accident i was sent to a startup
01:29 - and after i was there for a few days i
01:31 - realized wow there's something
01:32 - interesting here and i was answering the
01:34 - phone at this place and i thought you
01:36 - know i actually would like to do more
01:37 - than answer the phone i think i could do
01:39 - the same type of work as the people here
01:41 - in the office how do i do that
01:43 - i'm going to take a computer science
01:44 - class
01:46 - now i was a senior in college writing my
01:48 - thesis studying history and literature
01:51 - and i thought surely it is too late for
01:53 - me because i'm 20 and i'm a senior and
01:57 - my life has already been decided um and
02:00 - i just can't change but i had a friend
02:03 - and she was taking a computer science
02:05 - class and i always think back to that
02:07 - about how influential everyone can be
02:09 - whether they're a student if you're an
02:11 - eighth grader you can influence a sixth
02:12 - grader so my friend was taking a
02:14 - computer science class and i thought you
02:15 - know if she's taking it i can probably
02:18 - take it so here i was i signed up for
02:20 - computer science my senior year as a
02:22 - history and literature major
02:24 - and took it and that's how i discovered
02:26 - my passion for computer science
02:33 - it was it was amazing to me that this
02:35 - one class
02:36 - really changed my life
02:38 - and
02:39 - i'm always grateful and think wow my
02:40 - life could have been very different if i
02:42 - hadn't had that one experience in that
02:44 - one class now i was very lucky to take
02:47 - this class
02:48 - but in today's world where technology is
02:51 - changing every single thing we do it
02:53 - shouldn't be about a matter of luck
02:56 - um computer science actually does a lot
02:58 - in data as we talked about and
03:01 - computer science is something that
03:03 - should be available to all students
03:07 - students also shouldn't have to wait
03:08 - until college
03:10 - i'm amazed the way a two-year-old can
03:12 - pick up a phone and figure out how to
03:14 - use it our kids today are digital
03:16 - natives they should have the access to
03:18 - learning computer science today in their
03:20 - school
03:21 - but many kids do not have that
03:23 - opportunity google commissioned a study
03:26 - and it showed that only 40 percent
03:28 - of kids in k-12 schools in the u.s offer
03:31 - computer science class and have access
03:33 - to them
03:35 - and as low as that number is the good
03:37 - news is it's an improvement because two
03:39 - years ago the number was only 10
03:42 - so it shows that we can make progress
03:44 - when we focus on it and i do think
03:45 - code.org definitely had something to do
03:47 - with raising the number from 10 to 40
03:50 - but we still have 60 the majority of
03:53 - kids still are not getting computer
03:54 - science and that's why there's so much
03:57 - important work left to do now it also
04:00 - has an impact on diversity
04:02 - the ap exam for computer science has the
04:05 - worst racial diversity of any ap course
04:09 - only 22 percent of students who take the
04:11 - course are students of color
04:14 - and black students in particular are
04:16 - less likely to have access to computer
04:18 - science classes compared to white and
04:20 - hispanic students so unless we make
04:22 - computer science something that is
04:24 - available to everybody
04:26 - we risk making these racial disparities
04:28 - worse
04:30 - now on the other hand if we provide it
04:32 - to everyone we also have an opportunity
04:34 - to benefit everyone and if you look at
04:36 - the economy you look at the importance
04:38 - that technology and tech jobs play in
04:40 - our society there are nearly half a
04:42 - million open computing jobs in the u.s
04:45 - in every
04:46 - state in every industry and they are
04:48 - projected to grow at twice the rate
04:51 - so we have a chance to enable all kids
04:53 - no matter where their background is
04:56 - where they come from which family they
04:58 - grew up with their only child or 15 one
05:00 - of 15
05:02 - to give them the opportunity to have
05:04 - these experiences
05:06 - google has been working to provide
05:09 - funding to non-profits to expand coding
05:11 - in schools
05:12 - we have our made for code initiative to
05:15 - inspire girls to take coding and as part
05:17 - of cs week we're encouraging students to
05:19 - also try the hour of code and we're
05:21 - doing a project to build a holiday emoji
05:24 - so if you're looking for a good project
05:25 - to do with your kid
05:27 - this is one and you can create your own
05:28 - google logo with the special coding
05:30 - activity and we also have a google
05:32 - doodle that encourages people to
05:35 - solve a puzzle using simple block block
05:38 - coding
05:39 - so i'm very happy to be here kicking off
05:41 - this week i can't emphasize enough how
05:43 - important this area is for every kid out
05:47 - there in the future and for our
05:50 - community our society our country and
05:53 - the opportunity to enable all those
05:55 - great kids out there in the world to
05:56 - really be the next leaders in technology
05:58 - and to make a difference for our world
06:00 - so thank you for being here i'm excited
06:02 - to kick off all the projects that we're
06:04 - going to be doing together thank you
06:06 - [Applause]
