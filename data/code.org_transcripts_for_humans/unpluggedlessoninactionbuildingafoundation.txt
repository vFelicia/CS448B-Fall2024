00:12 - one of the really important things in
00:14 - computer science is that there are still
00:17 - a lot of problems that no one has solved
00:21 - yet so like in school you know when
00:24 - you're adding 2 plus
00:27 - three right people have done that before
00:29 - right so how thrilling is that do you
00:32 - feel like you're an Explorer and you're
00:34 - an innovator and you've discovered
00:36 - something new no but the truth is that
00:41 - when you're exploring and you're
00:44 - innovating things get really really hard
00:48 - sometimes because sometimes you come to
00:51 - a place where there are problems and
00:54 - there is
00:55 - nobody that knows how to solve them and
00:59 - you have to try and figure it out all by
01:01 - yourself so what happens if you get to a
01:05 - problem that no one has solved yet and
01:09 - you just go oh darn it no one solved
01:13 - this guess I'm
01:15 - done will you ever really invent
01:17 - anything no no will you ever really
01:21 - create something brand new no no you'll
01:26 - explore things and sometimes you'll
01:28 - explore things and you don't know what
01:30 - they do and to keep yourself safe you
01:34 - have to know what steps you need to take
01:37 - to explore something right yeah so
01:41 - that's what this lesson is going to be
01:43 - all about it's going to be all about
01:45 - creating something new and knowing that
01:49 - there are going to be times when there
01:51 - you don't know something and I know you
01:54 - don't know it and I know it's going to
01:56 - be hard but you guys are going to have
01:58 - to keep working and try and figure it
02:01 - out so what what are the things that you
02:04 - worry about if we are doing something
02:06 - and you don't know how to do it what are
02:09 - some of the things you'll worry
02:11 - about um if I'm doing a timed
02:15 - multiplication test so I'm worried that
02:17 - I won't finish it in time so if you
02:22 - don't know something very well you might
02:23 - worry that you won't finish it in time
02:27 - or that you won't be fast enough so how
02:31 - do you think you would feel if you're
02:32 - working on a project and you're working
02:34 - on a project and it didn't work so you
02:36 - try again and you try again and it still
02:39 - doesn't work and then you try again and
02:41 - you try some more and it still doesn't
02:43 - work how are you going to feel a little
02:46 - bit bad a little bit bad worried
02:50 - worried um distressed distressed you
02:55 - might feel in distress frustrated
02:57 - frustrated that's a really good word
03:00 - these are all really good words to
03:01 - describe the feelings that we have when
03:03 - we're trying something new but you know
03:05 - what's really important is if we
03:08 - understand that we're going to have
03:10 - those feelings and we understand that
03:12 - everybody is going to feel something
03:14 - kind of like that then it gives us
03:17 - permission to say well I know I feel
03:20 - like this but I'm going to keep working
03:22 - anyway and so if you've been not getting
03:24 - it and not getting it and you're
03:26 - frustrated and you're stressed and
03:28 - you're in distress and then you get it
03:32 - and it works and then you feel amazing
03:36 - and wonderful and happy and you know and
03:40 - Panda and you need those feelings of of
03:44 - oh no I'm afraid before you break
03:47 - through to those feelings of yay this
03:49 - was
03:51 - amazing and so now every time you feel
03:54 - oh this is scary oh I feel bad about
03:57 - myself oh I feel
04:00 - distress I want you to tell yourself in
04:02 - your head that means that when I
04:06 - persevere and I figure it out I'm going
04:10 - to feel excited happy right really
04:14 - that's really really good so that's what
04:18 - this lesson is all about I'm going to
04:20 - give you a challenge and it's going to
04:22 - be hard I'm not going to lie to you as
04:24 - hard as pandom it's supposed to be hard
04:28 - it's supposed to be challenging with a
04:30 - team and it it you'll you can work
04:32 - you'll work in a team but you'll all be
04:34 - building your own structures okay and
04:37 - you're supposed to feel a little bit of
04:39 - frustration because it won't work right
04:41 - away and that's okay I want you to keep
04:44 - working until you get it and you guys
04:48 - are going to go Miss Kiki Miss Kiki can
04:51 - I have some help and I'm going to say
04:54 - nope and you're gonna say Miss Kiki Miss
04:57 - Kiki I don't know how to do this and I'm
05:00 - going to say I know and you're going to
05:03 - think Miss Kiki is really mean sometimes
05:07 - but then when you guys get your thing to
05:09 - work and you did it all by yourself you
05:13 - won't think Miss Kiki is mean anymore
05:15 - then you'll understand what I was trying
05:16 - to do
05:20 - okay okay you each get your own
05:24 - supplies all right don't eat them you
05:27 - need to make a structure
05:30 - that is at least as tall as the
05:33 - cup and it has to be strong
05:37 - enough to hold this book what are you
05:41 - kidding I'm not kidding you kidding and
05:45 - you can only use the tools that are
05:48 - inside the cup so you don't get any more
05:52 - if you break them or eat them then
05:54 - you're making it even harder for
05:56 - yourself teachers have said that if you
05:59 - get spice drops instead of the fruit
06:01 - flavored gumdrops the kids are much less
06:03 - likely to eat the
06:04 - supply this lesson is difficult for the
06:08 - students but it's supposed to be
06:09 - difficult for the students once you tell
06:11 - them that you're not going to interfere
06:13 - with their lesson don't interfere with
06:16 - their lesson it's really important this
06:19 - activity really will change the thinking
06:22 - of your classroom and you'll find that
06:24 - when you refer back to it kids are more
06:26 - likely to persevere just a little bit
06:28 - longer in almost
06:33 - anything
