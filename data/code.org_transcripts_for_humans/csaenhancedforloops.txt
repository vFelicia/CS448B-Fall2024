00:10 - my name is craig and i solve business
00:12 - problems for customers leveraging
00:14 - technology from a developer perspective
00:16 - there are basic things you have to do to
00:18 - create code
00:19 - but from there you can really use your
00:21 - imagination your vision
00:23 - to think of ways that the software the
00:26 - application the game that you're
00:27 - creating can really enhance the
00:29 - experience for those that are using it
00:31 - we have already learned about two ways
00:34 - to loop using while loops and for loops
00:38 - now we're going to take a look at how
00:39 - enhanced for loops work
00:42 - an enhanced for loop is a for loop that
00:45 - loops through the entirety of a data
00:47 - structure like an array
00:50 - enhanced for loops simplify things
00:53 - we only need to set up a single variable
00:55 - to access the contents of each position
00:58 - in the array
01:00 - let's look at an example of how we would
01:02 - write an enhanced for loop
01:05 - here is an array of numbers called nums
01:07 - it has been initialized with the numbers
01:09 - 1 2 3 and 4.
01:12 - we write our enhanced for loop by
01:14 - writing 4
01:16 - and then inside the parentheses declare
01:18 - a variable of a type that matches the
01:20 - array
01:21 - then we write a colon
01:23 - and finally the name of the array you
01:25 - want to traverse
01:28 - in our example
01:30 - nums is an array of integers so the
01:32 - variable num has to be of type integer
01:37 - in the loop the variable num is used to
01:39 - traverse
01:40 - the full array in order
01:43 - each time we loop through the array
01:45 - num will contain the data at each
01:47 - position of the array in order
01:50 - and it will increment by one to move on
01:52 - to the next position
01:54 - until it reaches the end of the array
01:57 - for example if we print num inside of
01:59 - the loop it will print one the first
02:02 - time
02:03 - then two
02:04 - then three
02:06 - then four
02:07 - and complete the loop
02:09 - one thing to keep in mind is that our
02:12 - variable num is not storing the indices
02:15 - in the array it actually holds a copy of
02:18 - the value at each index in the array
02:22 - that means if you modify the variable
02:24 - num in any way
02:26 - it will not have an effect on the array
02:28 - itself
02:30 - also with an enhanced for loop you can't
02:33 - move over part of the array it will
02:35 - always loop over the full array
02:39 - enhanced for loops are a quick way to
02:41 - write a loop to access all elements in
02:44 - an array
