01:34 - company called expanse but you used to
01:35 - work for the department of defense
01:37 - in this sort of spy agency i'm looking
01:39 - forward to hearing about your work later
01:41 - but we're going to start for the first
01:42 - 20 minutes with ashton because he has a
01:43 - limited amount of time uh ashton where
01:46 - are you calling from
01:48 - i'm calling from my house in los angeles
01:51 - all right so what have you been doing
01:52 - with all this extra time we have
01:55 - well i've been in my house now uh for
01:58 - about four and a half weeks
02:00 - uh
02:01 - and um i have two kids one's five and
02:05 - one's three
02:06 - so we're spending a lot of time uh doing
02:08 - home school uh and we figured out uh as
02:12 - many of you have figured out that the
02:13 - best way to do homeschool is to actually
02:16 - outsource it and so we have a lot of our
02:18 - friends calling in with 30 minute teach
02:21 - me anythings uh
02:23 - with our kids which has been just
02:25 - awesome uh and
02:27 - uh trying to do a little bit of work we
02:29 - have a lot of companies at soundventures
02:31 - which is my investment fund and a lot of
02:34 - these companies uh given the sort of
02:37 - economic times that we're all about to
02:38 - face are facing a lot of changes so i've
02:41 - been working with a lot of them as to
02:43 - how how they can
02:45 - make the changes inside their companies
02:47 - um in order to sort of not only survive
02:50 - but thrive through this period of time
02:52 - and uh beyond that i've been working
02:55 - hard to get uh
02:56 - ppe personal protective equipment uh to
02:59 - hospitals around the country
03:01 - and uh figuring out how to get uh
03:04 - broad-based testing um uh
03:07 - syndicated as widely as possible
03:10 - so uh just you know
03:12 - pounding it away and trying to do my
03:14 - best to stay and stay busy um but also
03:18 - just having a lot of fun um i find
03:21 - i don't spend a lot of time at home
03:23 - because i end up working so much so it's
03:25 - really exciting for me to actually just
03:27 - be home and and get
03:29 - like find the precipice of being bored
03:32 - uh because because when you finally let
03:35 - your mind get to the point where your
03:37 - boy that's when you start to get
03:39 - creative i think
03:41 - yeah
03:42 - well for the homeschooling for your
03:43 - five-year-olds you're welcome to have
03:45 - them join code break each week for one
03:47 - hour uh our our show starts with stuff
03:50 - that the youngest kids can even follow
03:52 - along so at least the first half hour of
03:54 - it should be pretty fun um do you have
03:57 - any thoughts to share with the students
03:58 - who are all at home while school is
04:00 - closed basically all around the country
04:02 - and all around the world
04:03 - almost a billion students are now at
04:05 - home
04:06 - yeah i mean here's the thing when i was
04:09 - in school
04:10 - this was like a this would be like a
04:12 - dream like not having to go to school
04:14 - would seem like it would be like a dream
04:17 - for me so but then you're faced with the
04:19 - reality of it you're like wait a second
04:21 - i kind of want to hang out with my
04:22 - friends and actually uh when i'm at
04:24 - school it's really fun and i learn
04:26 - things and so uh i guess my advice is is
04:30 - like
04:31 - actually the the coolest thing is when
04:34 - you're at school all the time
04:36 - you kind of have to do and learn just
04:38 - what everybody else is learning and when
04:40 - you're doing homeschooling stuff you may
04:42 - have a little bit more time to learn and
04:44 - focus on the things that you really care
04:45 - about and and and build things um
04:49 - because i really do think that
04:51 - that the brightest and and coolest
04:54 - things that are going to be built are
04:55 - going to be built by you guys um and
04:58 - you're you're you are you are building
05:00 - the future right now whether you know it
05:02 - or not uh because the the thoughts and
05:05 - ideas that you're getting in your head
05:06 - um those are going to be the future and
05:09 - and i'm excited to live in your future
05:13 - all right well i'm home with my family
05:15 - as well my daughter sophia joins us each
05:17 - week partly to learn partly to keep me
05:19 - in check she's got an app to make sound
05:22 - effects you want to make us a sound
05:23 - effect right now
05:25 - um so she's my daughter and a student
05:27 - and a co-host and also part of the
05:29 - production crew
05:30 - and we're going to be fantastic
05:32 - we're going to start with this week's
05:34 - computer joke of the day with sophia so
05:36 - ashton what clothing does a computer
05:38 - programmer wear
05:41 - a hoodie
05:43 - nope
05:44 - whatever is in the dress code
05:49 - the dress code
05:50 - all right yeah i have to give a dad joke
05:53 - once a week um let's meet some of the
05:55 - live audience who's on camera we have
05:57 - dozens of students on camera uh can
05:59 - everybody wave and say hi to ashton
06:04 - hey
06:10 - also learn a bit about the rest of our
06:12 - audience uh those of you who've been
06:14 - joining us each week you may notice that
06:16 - we've disabled the chat feature it's
06:18 - only accessible to the folks who are
06:20 - live on camera you can still see what
06:22 - those folks are typing if you click chat
06:24 - but we had to disable this because last
06:26 - week some students use very offensive
06:28 - language i've written personal letters
06:30 - to the students who acted this way
06:31 - giving them a chance to apologize and we
06:33 - establish a code of conduct for code
06:35 - break to make sure everybody behaves in
06:37 - a way that's consistent with being a
06:38 - respectful young adult whether in a
06:40 - classroom or a future career but we
06:42 - still have the opportunity to engage our
06:44 - entire audience interactively even
06:46 - without chat for example to find out
06:48 - where everybody's from we use the
06:50 - geographic poll and i'm going to screen
06:52 - share this and ash and mia you can let
06:54 - us know if you're surprised
06:56 - from one of some of the places that
06:57 - people are calling in from
07:00 - wow that is impressive
07:02 - there's a lot of people from antarctica
07:04 - that it seems
07:08 - i want to be in antarctica right now you
07:10 - you wouldn't have to worry about getting
07:11 - coronavirus
07:13 - that is that's true
07:14 - there's people as far east as china
07:16 - where it's very late in their day
07:18 - now let's do another live poll we want
07:20 - to get a sense of what grade the
07:22 - students are in so we're going to post a
07:24 - live poll to see to have everybody enter
07:27 - your grade
07:28 - and this is going to come up on your
07:29 - screen sofia you want to fill out your
07:31 - poll right there
07:34 - all right we're getting the answers
07:35 - coming in
07:39 - it seems like the biggest group is in
07:41 - in sixth to eighth grade but there's
07:44 - literally all grades represented
07:46 - wow
07:48 - all right could we uh
07:50 - around 70 800 of you have voted so these
07:52 - are the poll results for what grade
07:53 - students earn we have kindergarteners
07:55 - all the way through 12th grades and
07:57 - at least 16 of our audience is beyond
07:59 - k-12 let's do another poll to find out
08:01 - your computer science experience level
08:04 - because there's people who are total
08:05 - beginners and people who are advanced
08:08 - and we want to have something for
08:09 - everybody so if you could all enter your
08:12 - levels sophia you can enter yours too
08:15 - and what we're going to do each week is
08:16 - we start with material that's great for
08:18 - the beginners and then we'll get more
08:20 - and more advanced so
08:22 - if you're a beginner the fast stuff at
08:24 - the end even if you can't follow along
08:26 - you should just try to watch it because
08:27 - you learn a little bit and if you're
08:29 - more advanced uh it doesn't matter to if
08:32 - we'd love for you to be patient to the
08:33 - early stuff we'll try to make something
08:35 - that everybody can learn
08:37 - all right we have 70 of the audience
08:39 - having uh voted so if we could share
08:41 - those results on screen as well
08:46 - all right yeah you can see that majority
08:48 - of the group are intermediate uh so as
08:50 - we go through this i
08:52 - i can i can i just say something about
08:54 - watching advanced people work
08:56 - um
08:57 - you know i always think about uh you
08:59 - know programming or anything like this i
09:02 - always think about it like uh watching
09:04 - like a basketball game or a professional
09:08 - football game or something like that
09:10 - like
09:11 - when you watch people who are really
09:13 - really great and professionals and
09:15 - advanced at something it gives you ideas
09:18 - and inspires how you can potentially
09:20 - work so it's really important to watch
09:22 - people that are better at you
09:24 - doing stuff because you'll learn tricks
09:27 - and ideas and and things
09:29 - that and even though you don't
09:30 - completely understand why they're doing
09:32 - everything they're doing or how they're
09:33 - doing it
09:34 - you can get inspired from it and someday
09:37 - you'll see yourself and look back and go
09:40 - oh wait i remember when i was watching
09:41 - that that person that was way better
09:43 - than me doing something so just think
09:45 - about like watching like the nba or
09:47 - something like that
09:48 - we don't have to be that good at
09:50 - basketball to watch and enjoy the nba
09:54 - absolutely
09:55 - by the way for the folks who are not
09:56 - going to be on camera and really for all
09:58 - of you if you have questions during this
10:00 - episode there's a q button for q a
10:02 - button
10:03 - which you can click to submit questions
10:05 - the team at code.org will answer
10:07 - many of your questions live in real time
10:09 - and we're going to have some of the best
10:11 - questions read out for ashton and also
10:12 - from mia gil ebner
10:14 - tweet for us at today's episode we're
10:17 - going to learn about encryption
10:19 - we're going to have three segments first
10:21 - we're going to learn about a simple
10:22 - cipher
10:23 - next we're going to learn about password
10:25 - strength which is something the adults
10:27 - can even benefit from and lastly we're
10:28 - going to in real time code an app to
10:30 - help us make passwords that are stronger
10:32 - than the ones you probably use uh
10:35 - this is our third time doing this kind
10:36 - of a live interactive format with
10:38 - thousands of people on one zoom call so
10:40 - we are going to have glitches
10:42 - when we have glitches we're going to
10:43 - learn an important computer science
10:45 - concept called debugging
10:47 - this is
10:48 - bug
10:50 - and so please bear with us if we have
10:52 - any issues as we go uh so before we
10:54 - start the lesson we want to welcome two
10:56 - student groups to demo their creations
10:58 - from last week last week's challenge was
11:01 - to create an app or an interactive card
11:03 - and each week when you share your
11:04 - creations with us we'll invite you on
11:06 - the show next week to share them so
11:08 - first i'd like to introduce hannah
11:10 - christina pratusha sophia and lily this
11:12 - is a five person team uh can you all say
11:15 - hi so we can see you
11:17 - hi
11:20 - and can we switch to gallery view as
11:21 - well so we can so folks can see all
11:23 - these students
11:25 - all right um
11:27 - so uh hannah can you say hello and tell
11:29 - us where you're all from and introduce
11:31 - your teammates
11:32 - yes we're all from franklin
11:33 - massachusetts and franklin high school
11:35 - my uh teammates are lily sophia
11:39 - ceramides patricia nadori and elizabeth
11:41 - fall
11:43 - all right uh so i'm gonna put your app
11:46 - on screen share and then you can
11:47 - describe the app uh for and for ashton
11:50 - to basically react to it so give me just
11:52 - one second and this is the app that the
11:54 - this group made as a team
11:58 - all right can you all see my app
12:01 - all right you're going to go ahead and
12:02 - tell us about it
12:04 - so the app we develop is based on the
12:05 - mental health issues that occur among
12:07 - adolescents the prevalence of mental
12:09 - health issues is largest among young
12:10 - adults with approximately one in five
12:12 - teens suffering from at least one mental
12:14 - health disorder these disorders can have
12:16 - a significant impact on daily life and
12:17 - overall well-being our goal is to create
12:19 - an app that aided students in resolving
12:21 - these issues through the use of various
12:22 - resources right at their fingertips
12:24 - based on the structure of the app no
12:26 - matter what conflict the student is
12:27 - experiencing the app provides a solution
12:29 - accordingly the user begins by signing
12:31 - in or logging in from there they choose
12:33 - a user-friendly emoji representing the
12:35 - current emotion they are then prompted
12:37 - to select the category a problem that
12:38 - they are facing if any from there
12:40 - students are provided with multiple
12:42 - paths eventually resulting in a
12:43 - problem-specific solution for the
12:45 - student with over 20 screens the app
12:47 - allows for a resolution to almost any
12:49 - problem equipped with back buttons so
12:51 - students are able to navigate
12:53 - easily between screens especially if
12:55 - they are facing multiple issues our hope
12:57 - is that with our app teams will be more
12:59 - equipped with the skills they need to
13:00 - develop socially and emotionally thank
13:02 - you
13:03 - wow so
13:04 - if i want to try this app tell me what
13:06 - should i do i guess i should click the
13:07 - welcome button
13:08 - yes yeah
13:10 - all right i'm not going to log in or
13:12 - sign up i'll use it as a guest so let's
13:14 - check in ashton how are you feeling
13:15 - today
13:17 - uh i'm i'm feeling fantastic
13:21 - well that's pretty good
13:23 - all right
13:24 - the app is glad to see you're doing so
13:26 - well let's pretend
13:28 - thank you thank you app
13:30 - of course
13:32 - let's try it again and pretend we're not
13:33 - feeling as good to see what hannah and
13:35 - her team have prepared so what's a less
13:37 - good feeling mission i am devastated and
13:40 - really sad and crying
13:44 - what is bothering you
13:46 - what is bothering me oh
13:48 - boy i'm just stressed out about my
13:50 - future plans
13:51 - future plans all right are you worried
13:54 - more about college or your standardized
13:55 - tests
13:56 - oh man i'm uh i'm worried about college
14:00 - it seems that i didn't go
14:04 - first or finding a college i think it
14:06 - sounds like getting into college is your
14:07 - warrior probably i should try to get
14:09 - into a college since i've never gone
14:12 - well i i quit i dropped out so all right
14:14 - so if you're worried about getting your
14:17 - grades or upcoming assessments here's
14:18 - some resources so for regardless of
14:20 - which subject you're in there's
14:22 - resources and websites that helped you
14:24 - study in this app oh great
14:27 - that's right that's wonderful uh let's
14:29 - switch to the next app and the next
14:31 - student is sophie here with us as well
14:34 - hi
14:36 - hi sophie where are you calling from
14:38 - bellevue washington bellevue washington
14:40 - can you tell us about your app and then
14:43 - we'll screenshare it and go through a
14:44 - demo
14:45 - yeah so as a teen entrepreneur myself of
14:47 - a fashion backpack business called
14:49 - tashan bags i understand the value and
14:51 - importance of small businesses in our
14:53 - time especially with the coronavirus so
14:56 - our local restaurants are truly the
14:58 - heart of our community and bellevue
14:59 - bites offers a list of restaurants
15:01 - updated daily near you that are offering
15:04 - takeout delivery discounts because a lot
15:06 - of people are on a tight budget right
15:07 - now but still want to afford to support
15:10 - local businesses so right now bellevue
15:12 - bites serves the seattle and bellevue
15:14 - area but we hope to evolve in the future
15:17 - and unlike ubereats and other food apps
15:19 - that charge restaurants a fee per order
15:21 - bellevue bites lets the restaurant keep
15:23 - all the profits and provides a free
15:25 - promotional platform we hope to help the
15:27 - local economy grow along with the small
15:29 - businesses that make it unique
15:31 - thank you
15:33 - all right and how do i get into this app
15:35 - i guess i should click to find a
15:36 - restaurant near me
15:38 - to find a restaurant near you and then
15:39 - right now it's in the seattle moby area
15:41 - so let's say you're in seattle
15:43 - um so then now we have exclusive
15:46 - discounts with restaurants that are
15:48 - partnered with us and if you click on
15:50 - their logo you can be taken to the
15:52 - website for example
15:55 - um
15:55 - yeah so it'll go it'll take you
15:57 - eventually to the website
15:59 - and it's just a great way for small
16:01 - businesses to connect and a resource for
16:03 - people in the community
16:06 - well thank you so much for making this
16:07 - app and for doing your part to help
16:09 - small businesses deal with the crisis
16:11 - we're in uh these apps are all built on
16:13 - code.org lab uh and we are going to be
16:16 - by the end of this episode demoing how
16:17 - easy it is to make your own app uh hey
16:20 - sophie that app is awesome can i give
16:23 - you can i give you can i give you one
16:24 - piece of advice
16:26 - so on every single page that you create
16:30 - with an app and this is like this is the
16:32 - same advice like i i gave and i actually
16:35 - learned this from kevin sinstrom who
16:36 - created instagram
16:38 - uh and and what he always said to me
16:41 - about product when i was learning about
16:43 - product really early on he was like
16:45 - every single page of any app that you
16:48 - have you have one thing that you want
16:50 - the customer to do the most
16:53 - and and you have to make sure that that
16:55 - one thing you want the customer to do
16:57 - the most
16:58 - is the most prominent thing and the
17:01 - easiest thing for them to actually click
17:04 - and so it was funny when hadi was uh
17:07 - looking at your homepage
17:08 - he was had to kind of search for where
17:10 - to push right like what the first thing
17:13 - to click was because it was kind of
17:15 - hidden down in the bottom so you try to
17:18 - try to always think about like what do
17:20 - you what do you as the creator want the
17:23 - user to do on every single page and make
17:26 - sure that that is has some that is
17:28 - featured in some way that that makes
17:31 - them think oh i should probably push
17:32 - this yeah yeah yeah so it's more yeah i
17:35 - see what you're saying completely yeah
17:37 - awesome
17:38 - thank you great
17:39 - yeah sure
17:42 - so today we want to start today's lesson
17:44 - and what we're going to learn about is
17:45 - encryption so today's computer science
17:47 - word of the day is
17:49 - encryption uh thank you sophia for
17:51 - making this sound for us uh encryption
17:53 - is how we protect data by changing it
17:55 - into something secret that nobody else
17:57 - can figure out unless they decrypt it
17:59 - and we're going to learn one of the most
18:01 - simple ways to do this um but ashton i
18:04 - first want to ask what are some examples
18:05 - of why it's important to protect data
18:07 - whether you're when you're using any of
18:09 - the top web sites or apps in the world
18:12 - yeah i so so
18:14 - one of the first things is is that you
18:17 - know i'm
18:18 - everybody out there probably everybody
18:20 - on this call
18:21 - is a really good person that's trying to
18:23 - do really good things in the world and
18:25 - there are some people out there that are
18:28 - that don't have everybody's best
18:30 - intentions in mind and
18:32 - when our our information and our data is
18:35 - on different different services and
18:38 - there's all kinds of things that can be
18:40 - on on different services so like your
18:42 - what kind of phone you have
18:44 - where you're at when you're using your
18:46 - phone if you buy things and you put a
18:49 - credit card credit card information in
18:52 - in into your phone or onto a website all
18:54 - that information gets stored in
18:56 - databases and when we're communicating
18:59 - back and forth and when these websites
19:01 - are communicating back and forth if that
19:03 - data isn't safe and sometimes we let's
19:06 - say we go to uh you know a shopping
19:09 - platform and it's a brand new shopping
19:12 - platform it's only a very little company
19:14 - and you put your information in there if
19:16 - that company goes out of business
19:18 - sometimes other companies buy your
19:21 - information from that from that company
19:24 - and next thing you know you have
19:25 - somebody who you really don't you
19:27 - wouldn't give your credit card
19:29 - information to or somebody that you
19:31 - really wouldn't give personal
19:32 - information to
19:34 - now they've got your data and so making
19:36 - sure that that who we are where we are
19:39 - who our friends are what our banking or
19:42 - credit card information is is protected
19:45 - is really really important because
19:48 - once it's on the internet
19:50 - a lot of people can can steal it and
19:52 - take it and use it for for bad things to
19:56 - steal money from us to hurt people uh
19:59 - and
20:00 - and ultimately to pretend like they're
20:02 - you if they want to and then they can go
20:04 - to other websites pretending like
20:06 - they're you and and spend your money
20:08 - that way or
20:10 - ruin your reputation like imagine if
20:12 - somebody didn't really like you very
20:14 - much and they wanted to make you other
20:16 - people think that you were a bad person
20:18 - they could take your identity
20:20 - and use it on another platform and make
20:23 - you look like a really bad person by
20:25 - saying some really mean things to people
20:26 - and doing nasty stuff and we don't want
20:28 - to we don't want that to happen
20:30 - so today we're going to learn about a
20:32 - really simple form of encryption using a
20:34 - simple cipher known as a caesar cipher
20:36 - which was once used by emperor julius
20:38 - caesar in the roman empire
20:39 - ashton did you get the packet that we
20:41 - sent you
20:42 - this packet yeah it said don't open it
20:45 - until the live episode uh so i assume
20:48 - you'll see it still sealed it is
20:50 - encrypted at this point within this
20:52 - envelope all right so can you open it
20:54 - for us right now
20:56 - of course i can
20:58 - this is this is the most rudimentary
21:00 - form of encryption put it in a package
21:07 - ah-ha
21:09 - we have here a wheel do you have a wheel
21:11 - that's a caesar cipher that sophia made
21:13 - for you i did not you drew it
21:17 - we were supposed to say that you made it
21:19 - no you did all right fine
21:21 - i gave it up well
21:23 - i made it
21:24 - i even called out that beautiful flower
21:27 - to make it look like an 11 year old made
21:29 - it sofia was busy doing homework
21:31 - but what that wheel does you see two
21:33 - wheels inside each other and if you turn
21:35 - each one of them what it does is it can
21:37 - give you instructions to replace one
21:39 - letter of the alphabet with a different
21:41 - letter of the alphabet to basically
21:43 - encode a message or to encrypt a message
21:46 - what we're going to do is ashton is
21:47 - going to pick a secret message and he's
21:49 - going to use this wheel to encrypt it
21:51 - and i want you to choose a one-word
21:54 - message to make it really simple
21:56 - and pick a position on the wheel and and
21:58 - map from one letter to another to to
22:00 - create a secret message and our entire
22:02 - live audience is gonna try to decrypt
22:04 - your message all at the same time so
22:06 - while ashton is encrypting i'm gonna
22:08 - show some slides now for what we want
22:10 - everybody else to do so that you can
22:12 - basically decrypt
22:14 - ashton's message so whoever is there on
22:16 - the audience whether you're on camera or
22:18 - not take a look at my screen for what i
22:20 - want you all to do
22:23 - at just one second
22:27 - i'm sharing my screen just right now
22:29 - [Music]
22:32 - okay
22:33 - there we go all right can you see my
22:35 - screen so what ashton had there is a
22:38 - caesar cipher built in a wheel
22:40 - but what we're going to do is do it on
22:42 - paper so you're going to have an
22:43 - alphabet that looks like this
22:45 - but each one of you is going to have a
22:47 - different version of this just like
22:49 - turning one of the wheels so there's a
22:51 - different point in the alphabet mapping
22:52 - one letter to another letter and some of
22:55 - you will get lucky if you get the right
22:57 - key to match to what action encrypts
22:59 - with so what i want you to do is take a
23:01 - piece of paper turn it sideways and at
23:04 - the top of the piece of paper write the
23:05 - alphabet
23:07 - but plan ahead so you don't run out of
23:08 - space when sophia did this the first
23:10 - time she ran out of space that's better
23:12 - this time
23:14 - so write the letters a through z all
23:16 - across the top
23:18 - next you want to pick a letter between b
23:21 - and z
23:22 - this is your secret key it's like a
23:24 - password and you're trying to guess the
23:26 - secret key that ashton has picked after
23:29 - you pick your secret key
23:31 - write another alphabet directly below it
23:34 - starting at the letter you picked and
23:37 - letter by letter go underneath those
23:38 - ones and write all the other letters of
23:40 - the alphabet and when you reach the end
23:42 - of the page at z
23:44 - you want to start over
23:45 - yeah you want to start over at the
23:47 - letter a
23:49 - i'm going to give you a little bit of
23:50 - time to do this for the students who are
23:52 - in the audience
23:53 - and can i ask if you're in the audience
23:55 - trying to do this
23:56 - when you finish can you raise your hand
23:58 - so we have a sense that you're done
23:59 - before we go on to the next step
24:05 - so you're going to need to end up
24:06 - writing two alphabets and each of you is
24:09 - going to be choosing a different key
24:13 - all right my computer is getting a
24:14 - little overloaded from all these hands
24:16 - being raised
24:20 - wow all right so what as you're doing
24:22 - this i'm going to go through to explain
24:23 - what you're going to do next is ashton
24:26 - is going to say his secret message he's
24:28 - going to read it letter by letter as he
24:30 - does that you want to write that down
24:31 - lower down on your piece of paper
24:33 - and then for each letter that ashton
24:36 - reads you want to find that letter in
24:38 - the top row of your cipher and look at
24:41 - the letter right below it
24:43 - and write that letter right below in the
24:45 - message and that way you can translate
24:48 - and some of you one out of 25 of you
24:50 - will have picked the same secret key as
24:52 - ashton and you'll be able to decrypt his
24:54 - message so it's going to be a question
24:56 - of who gets lucky to decrypt his message
24:57 - everybody who's live on camera has been
25:00 - given a different secret key so we'll
25:02 - all be able to do this together at the
25:03 - same time and see which ones of us can
25:05 - decode ashton's message so ashton are
25:08 - you ready with your secret super
25:11 - double extra secret message
25:13 - i'm ready with my double extra super
25:14 - secret extra super duper duper the most
25:18 - secretist message of all ever to been
25:20 - created that was secret
25:23 - all right secret
25:25 - all right so can you read out the
25:26 - letters one by one and everybody write
25:28 - them down as ashton reads them
25:32 - are you ready
25:34 - yes
25:36 - r
25:39 - d
25:47 - i repeat r
25:51 - d as in duck
25:54 - s
25:55 - as in
25:57 - simon
25:58 - t as in top
26:02 - all right so those of you who are in the
26:04 - audience if you get the right answer
26:07 - we want you to
26:08 - actually can we lower the hands of
26:10 - everybody who's in the live in in the
26:12 - audience in the not on screen if you're
26:15 - on screen raise your hand
26:18 - let's switch to gallery view so we can
26:20 - see all the students at the same time
26:22 - and if you get the right answer please
26:24 - raise your hand and wave your hand and
26:26 - this is if you basically get a letter a
26:28 - word that you can can read and it's a
26:30 - real english word raise your hand
26:34 - and it looks like about 43 people in the
26:37 - entire audience or 47 people in the
26:39 - audience got the right answer and one
26:41 - student has raised their hand
26:43 - uh
26:44 - can you can we unmute him i think this
26:46 - is eat cass
26:51 - casts hello yeah so
26:53 - so
26:55 - the message is called
26:58 - c-o-d-e wow that's a great secret
27:03 - c-o-d-e
27:04 - where are you calling us from
27:07 - india
27:09 - wow and what was ashton's secret key in
27:11 - this case
27:14 - uh
27:15 - rdst let's see so we were able to
27:19 - so we were able to solve this as humans
27:21 - with only a thousand of us in just a
27:23 - minute and we didn't have only one
27:25 - person do the work we had all of us
27:27 - spreading the work multiple people doing
27:29 - it at the same time so some of us got
27:31 - lucky to solve solve it correctly
27:34 - that's using a computer science concept
27:36 - called
27:37 - distributed computing we spread the work
27:39 - we distributed the work with multiple
27:41 - people doing it at the same time
27:43 - but let's see how long it would take for
27:45 - a computer to decrypt a similar message
27:48 - what we're going to do now is we're
27:50 - going to have a a computer app that
27:53 - basically does the same kind of
27:55 - encryption that you all did but it does
27:57 - it much much faster
27:59 - and i'm going to demo this and then
28:00 - ashton is going to encrypt another
28:02 - message so ashton uh would you mind
28:04 - encrypting another message while i show
28:06 - this to everybody
28:07 - sure i'm on it right now all right thank
28:10 - you so much uh so this here is a
28:13 - widget on code.org and we're going to
28:15 - send this to the email where you can
28:17 - write a message so i'm going to write
28:18 - ashton's original message rdst
28:22 - and you can see the secret message here
28:24 - and over here it shows what each of
28:26 - these letters is being replaced with
28:28 - and then i can shift them
28:30 - one by one letter by letter
28:33 - to see a change
28:35 - with each mapping you can see these
28:37 - letters here shift and a different
28:39 - version of ashton's secret message and
28:41 - if we click enough times
28:45 - we get to the right answer which is code
28:48 - so we are going to now do this again
28:50 - with another secret message
28:52 - and for all of you sophia is going to
28:54 - use the computer here sophia are you
28:56 - ready yes and ashton if you could read
28:58 - out your secret message and again we
29:00 - want everybody to to write theirs and
29:02 - you're going to be racing against the
29:03 - computer which sophia is going to be
29:05 - using so asham let's let's hear your new
29:07 - message
29:10 - n r
29:14 - j
29:17 - y
29:19 - space
29:22 - p
29:24 - f
29:26 - l
29:28 - i
29:30 - space
29:32 - y
29:34 - r
29:36 - e
29:37 - u
29:39 - jay
29:42 - all right
29:43 - so now sophia is going to try to decrypt
29:46 - this using the computer while students
29:48 - in the live audience if anybody in the
29:49 - live audience gets it faster than sophia
29:57 - raise your hands if you get it faster
29:59 - than sophia
30:03 - wow there's already 15 people who raised
30:05 - their hands
30:06 - and beat the computer at doing this
30:11 - it's going lower and lower
30:14 - oh
30:15 - i think you passed it
30:18 - there's ashton's super secret message
30:20 - extremely secret
30:22 - ashton was this your message
30:24 - that was my message wash your hands
30:27 - wash your hands and it looks like your
30:29 - key
30:30 - was the letter
30:32 - no the little letter r
30:35 - why is it why is your secret message
30:36 - wash your hands
30:38 - well because right now with the
30:40 - coronavirus the best thing that we can
30:43 - all do for ourselves to keep ourselves
30:45 - safe and keep the people around us safe
30:47 - is wash our hands and so whenever we
30:50 - touch something or a surface that we
30:52 - think anybody else has touched like a
30:54 - doorknob or a handle in a bathroom
30:57 - or a faucet sink and faucet handle or
31:01 - a table or flat surface the best thing
31:04 - we can do is wash our hands because the
31:06 - one thing that we know about this
31:08 - coronavirus is that it does not like
31:10 - soap
31:12 - right
31:13 - so one thing we also saw is that a lot
31:15 - of students were even faster than sophia
31:17 - and the computer at decrypting ashton's
31:20 - message and that's partly because we use
31:22 - distributed computing
31:23 - it's also because the secret key action
31:25 - picked was just a letter from b through
31:27 - z it's like a password that's one letter
31:29 - long and there's only 25 options so it
31:32 - wasn't hard to crack
31:34 - but we're going to learn about stronger
31:35 - passwords soon as we learn more about
31:37 - encryption but before ashton leaves we
31:40 - want to give the audience one last
31:41 - chance to ask him a question
31:43 - we have the students who are live on
31:44 - camera submit a bunch of questions and i
31:46 - want to introduce
31:47 - dior
31:48 - dior cease
31:50 - are you there with us
31:51 - hi
31:53 - i just wanted to ask um
31:56 - what have you learned about success and
31:58 - what do you think would be helpful for
32:00 - students to know
32:03 - what have i learned about success
32:07 - um
32:09 - i think the biggest thing that i've
32:11 - learned is that
32:13 - doing great things
32:15 - is uncomfortable
32:18 - um it's it it when you work really hard
32:23 - it's uncomfortable
32:24 - and the more that you can do things that
32:27 - are uncomfortable and that are a little
32:28 - bit hard and that are a little bit of a
32:30 - stretch for you
32:32 - the more comfortable those things become
32:35 - and the next thing you know you're doing
32:36 - really really really hard things that
32:40 - you couldn't have imagined yourself
32:41 - doing and it seems easy
32:44 - um and and i think the biggest thing
32:46 - that i've learned through my my career
32:49 - and the advice that i would give myself
32:51 - if i was your age
32:53 - is that
32:55 - the people who are building
32:57 - the coolest things in the world and the
33:00 - people that you look up to and admire
33:01 - the most
33:03 - they're no smarter than you are
33:06 - they don't have some special gift they
33:09 - don't have some special thing that you
33:11 - don't
33:12 - you've got it too
33:14 - and you've got to believe that you've
33:16 - got it and the more that you believe
33:18 - that you've got it the cooler things the
33:20 - greater things that you'll build in this
33:22 - world and you'll be the person that
33:24 - builds the things that other people
33:27 - are looking at going wow how did she do
33:30 - that i wish i could be a little bit more
33:32 - like dior
33:35 - well thank you so much ashton for your
33:36 - time with us at i know we ran a little
33:38 - bit later than we expected i hope you
33:41 - stay healthy and safe
33:42 - can the audience all say goodbye to
33:44 - ashton let's switch to gallery
33:46 - so we can see everybody everybody say
33:48 - goodbye sophia do you want to hit a
33:49 - little sound
33:51 - thank you so much ashley oh thank you
33:53 - thank you i appreciate it i hope to talk
33:56 - to you all soon
33:57 - all right keep up the good work
33:59 - thank you bye-bye uh all right mia we're
34:02 - gonna switch to you as mia there i am
34:04 - here hello all right so mia used to work
34:07 - for the national security agency the nsa
34:09 - which is one of the top spy agencies in
34:11 - the world even while she was a college
34:13 - student uh studying computer science
34:16 - working for the nsa is like the
34:18 - cyber security equivalent of joining the
34:20 - navy seals it's like the ultimate elite
34:22 - uh so i first wanted to ask what did it
34:24 - take to get in
34:26 - so it's not as hard as it might seem
34:30 - there are obviously some security
34:33 - concerns so you need to make sure that
34:34 - you pass a clearance
34:37 - investigation you need to take a
34:38 - polygraph stuff like that but in terms
34:41 - of computer science knowledge really i
34:44 - just had to be willing to learn and
34:46 - willing to study computer science so at
34:49 - the time i was in college
34:52 - i was majoring in computer science with
34:54 - a focus in cyber security and a lot of
34:57 - the things that i did at my job i
34:59 - learned on the job there are things that
35:01 - they teach you there and um
35:05 - it's meant that it was a great
35:07 - opportunity to get to expand my
35:08 - knowledge past just what my college
35:10 - classes were teaching me
35:13 - great
35:14 - um
35:15 - well we spent a whole bunch of time
35:18 - encrypting secret messages and we used
35:20 - those with a password that was as little
35:21 - as you know going from b through z or
35:24 - single letter but now let's talk about
35:26 - real passwords uh
35:27 - what are some
35:28 - some tips you can give us for creating
35:30 - good passwords
35:32 - well you should definitely never say
35:34 - your real password allowed to anyone
35:36 - especially on a video call with you know
35:38 - a thousand people watching
35:40 - um but anyway hottie what's what's your
35:43 - password
35:44 - nice try let's not talk about my
35:46 - password but sophia what's your password
35:48 - you already know my password
35:51 - wait i'm not the whole message is you're
35:53 - not supposed to share your password
35:55 - don't tell people that i know your
35:56 - password
35:58 - you're supposed to say you don't i'm not
35:59 - going to tell you um
36:01 - but speaking about passwords mia what's
36:03 - the name of your favorite pet in the
36:05 - street you grew up on
36:07 - i'm not going to tell you that one
36:08 - either
36:09 - but jokes aside is it safe to use things
36:11 - like your favorite pet or the street you
36:13 - grew up on for security purposes
36:16 - it's not so for example i talk about my
36:19 - cats ponyboy and dr wisconsin who i love
36:22 - dearly
36:23 - all the time so anyone who knows me just
36:26 - a little bit will know that those are my
36:28 - pets names and that they can try to use
36:30 - that as a security question answer or as
36:32 - a password for any of my accounts i hope
36:35 - none of my friends would do that but
36:37 - they might
36:39 - so if all this information about us is
36:41 - is on the internet in social media and
36:43 - people can figure out things about us
36:45 - why are companies still using these
36:46 - types of things for security questions
36:49 - that's a really good question it's
36:51 - difficult because for security questions
36:53 - you're usually not going to be entering
36:55 - them very frequently so you probably
36:58 - won't remember them that's why it's much
37:00 - easier to use something that you'll
37:01 - never forget like your first cars make
37:04 - and model or your pet or the street you
37:07 - grew up on
37:08 - because these are things that are just
37:10 - you know ingrained in your memory and
37:11 - you won't forget them
37:13 - it's a constant sort of struggle between
37:15 - usability making sure that the system is
37:18 - usable and that you can give an answer
37:20 - versus security giving something that
37:23 - people would not be able to guess
37:25 - so one of the things we want to do is we
37:27 - want the audience to get take a guess at
37:29 - what is the best password to use or the
37:31 - safer password to use the harder one for
37:33 - a computer to guess so we're going to do
37:35 - a live interactive poll
37:36 - and show two password options and we
37:38 - want everybody to guess which is the
37:40 - more secure password which is harder for
37:43 - a computer to guess so could we put the
37:45 - poll up on the screen
37:51 - uh it's still not showing all right
37:53 - there i think we see it so everybody
37:55 - take a guess at which password is more
37:57 - secure azr
37:59 - at d percent one
38:01 - or cat dog house panda bear
38:05 - which of these is harder for a computer
38:07 - to guess
38:08 - [Music]
38:11 - all right we have
38:13 - almost half the audience has already
38:15 - taken your guesses
38:17 - all right let's show the results on the
38:18 - screen
38:20 - all right so what you can see is almost
38:22 - everybody guessed that this hard to read
38:25 - pronounced
38:26 - unpronounceable password is more secure
38:28 - it has symbols it has letters it has
38:30 - uppercase letters it has numbers
38:32 - mia what do you think
38:34 - so i think it's a lot harder for a human
38:37 - to maybe guess the first password the
38:38 - one that starts with an a but i think
38:40 - it'll be harder for a computer to guess
38:42 - the second password
38:45 - really so you think everybody's wrong
38:47 - or most everybody's wrong let's let's
38:49 - use an app built on code.org app lab to
38:53 - see which of these passwords is easier
38:56 - or harder so this app is a how secure is
38:59 - your password app and it basically
39:01 - measures how long it would take a
39:03 - computer to to crack a password
39:05 - so the first password we tried was a z
39:09 - 3
39:10 - at sign d
39:12 - percent one
39:14 - and it says a computer would take two
39:16 - hours to crack this password just two
39:19 - hours which is a lot of time for a
39:20 - computer working uh
39:22 - do you remember the second password
39:24 - sophia what was it do you remember
39:26 - cat
39:28 - dog
39:29 - house panda bear
39:31 - house panda bear that was a much easier
39:33 - password to remember
39:34 - and it would take
39:36 - what is that number
39:37 - it's a big number six trillion trillion
39:40 - years for a computer to crack this
39:42 - password so it turns out mia was right
39:45 - about this
39:47 - and can i ask whether do people like the
39:49 - idea of having an app that measures how
39:50 - fast your password is if you want this
39:52 - app yourself
39:54 - this is the app it's built on app lab
39:56 - this is the code for the app you can see
39:58 - it but if anybody wants to check your
40:00 - own passwords at home
40:02 - if you have a phone you can scan this qr
40:04 - code right here
40:06 - hold your phone camera up to this qr
40:08 - code and
40:09 - the camera should pop up a little url so
40:12 - it will actually take you to the app if
40:13 - you click that notification and you can
40:16 - all type in your own secret passwords
40:18 - don't show it to somebody else but this
40:20 - app will tell you how strong your
40:21 - password is and how fast a computer
40:23 - would be able to crack it for you this
40:25 - is something i think all the adults on
40:27 - the screen and at home could also
40:29 - benefit from because all of us play a
40:31 - role in keeping our computers and our
40:33 - data safe so again you can scan the qr
40:35 - code we'll also send it to you via email
40:37 - as well i'm going to stop the screen
40:39 - share now
40:41 - so
40:43 - so mia why is it more secure to do that
40:46 - long password that had such easy words
40:48 - rather than this
40:49 - super strange one with with the symbols
40:52 - because for computers the thing that
40:54 - matters is how long the password is
40:57 - if you think about having a one
40:59 - character password there are 26 letters
41:02 - nine digits something like 13 special
41:04 - characters so there are you know maybe
41:08 - 50 options that can be that
41:10 - one character password if you have a two
41:12 - character password then you have 50
41:15 - times 50 options because each character
41:17 - means you have to try everything from
41:19 - the characters before
41:20 - plus everything for that last character
41:22 - every time you add another character to
41:25 - your password it gets even harder it
41:28 - adds more so it's an exponentially
41:30 - increasing problem that means that when
41:32 - you make a password super super long it
41:35 - becomes almost impossible for a computer
41:38 - to use a reasonable amount of time to
41:40 - try to guess that password it has to try
41:42 - every single option before it can get to
41:44 - the one that you've chosen
41:47 - a lot of us have been learning about
41:48 - exponential growth and exponential
41:50 - numbers in the last few weeks uh when
41:53 - we're talking about the spread of a
41:54 - virus but with the length of a password
41:55 - exponential growth and exponential
41:57 - numbers make make the same difference as
41:59 - well
42:00 - before mia says goodbye to us we have
42:03 - time for asking one question so uh do we
42:05 - have questions from the audience uh
42:08 - akira do you have a
42:10 - i want to introduce akira gilbert from
42:12 - code.org she's basically producing code
42:14 - break behind the scenes to to share a
42:16 - question from the audience with us
42:19 - akira are you there
42:21 - hi i am how are you
42:23 - great thank you where are you calling
42:24 - from
42:25 - i'm calling from new york so it's been a
42:27 - great time so far
42:29 - the epicenter in the us all right
42:32 - so what's the question for mia
42:34 - um the question about the app is first
42:37 - of all is it safe to enter your password
42:39 - into a second party app which
42:42 - i think we can answer very well
42:44 - that's a great point you
42:47 - shouldn't
42:48 - enter your app or enter your password
42:50 - into second party apps uh usually
42:53 - because you don't want that app to store
42:55 - the password um in this case we can see
42:58 - the code that we're using for this app
43:00 - you can see that it doesn't store
43:01 - anything so you can be pretty sure that
43:04 - it's just going to calculate the
43:06 - amount of time that it'll take and then
43:08 - it throws it away it won't save it and
43:10 - no one will be able to access it
43:12 - sounds great thanks mia yeah
43:16 - all right yeah in general you should
43:17 - never type your password on a screen on
43:19 - a computer unless you see the lock in
43:21 - the browser without the lock there it's
43:23 - actually dangerous because that means
43:25 - anybody on the internet can read what
43:26 - you're typing
43:28 - whether it's a password or credit card
43:30 - anything it's open for the entire world
43:32 - to to tap into unless you see the lock
43:34 - in the browser
43:36 - all right mia thank you so much for your
43:37 - time and stay safe and healthy uh
43:40 - everybody say goodbye to mia
43:42 - thank you i hope all of you stay safe
43:44 - and healthy as well uh have fun enjoy
43:47 - the rest of this lesson
43:49 - all right thank you
43:51 - all right so next we're gonna switch to
43:54 - uh this week's trivia question it's
43:56 - trivia time
43:59 - so the question is what was the release
44:01 - year of the first
44:02 - commercial computer with a display
44:05 - screen we're gonna put a live pull up
44:08 - for people to see the options so you
44:10 - know all of our computers and phones and
44:12 - everywhere you see a computer right now
44:14 - they have a screen but the question is
44:16 - what was the first computer commercial
44:18 - computer that had a screen because
44:20 - before they didn't have screens uh when
44:23 - was the computer screen
44:24 - introduced
44:26 - there's four different choices we have
44:27 - up on screen
44:29 - uh and it's not obvious which one there
44:31 - is i'm watching the audience live
44:33 - guesses come in and they are all over
44:36 - the map
44:40 - ranging from 1945 all the way to 1976.
44:44 - right if we could put the audience
44:45 - guesses up on screen
44:48 - so it should shows uh some of you
44:50 - thought it was in 1945 the inayak
44:53 - computer this the anayak was a 27 ton
44:56 - computer that actually used punch cards
44:59 - with holes in them to represent
45:00 - information they didn't have screens at
45:02 - the time after the niacc they used paper
45:05 - tape uh to actually show
45:08 - basically the the results of what a
45:09 - computer was calculating would be shown
45:11 - on paper tape uh the correct answer
45:14 - let me share my screen so you can see a
45:16 - photo of this beauty
45:18 - is
45:19 - the pdp-1 computer
45:21 - uh built in 1959 this entire thing you
45:24 - see on screen is this giant computer
45:27 - with all these wires and stuff behind it
45:29 - this computer today would fit in the
45:31 - size of a grain of sand almost
45:34 - and this here is the screen that it had
45:37 - this screen didn't have colors it only
45:40 - had one color to show it also couldn't
45:42 - even show words on screen it could only
45:44 - draw lines so if you use the artist app
45:47 - on code.org or logo
45:50 - or things like that we move forward turn
45:52 - left to draw lines that's the only thing
45:54 - it could do or in python or in python
45:57 - yes
45:58 - which sophia does but that's all it had
46:00 - as a screen so
46:02 - that's the answer for today's computer
46:04 - uh trivia question
46:06 - so now i want to switch to the last part
46:08 - of our episode
46:09 - the
46:11 - making of an app to make strong
46:15 - passwords we all saw how it's good to
46:17 - have strong passwords and you don't
46:19 - actually want to have passwords with
46:21 - weird symbols in them unless you can
46:22 - remember them and they're really long
46:24 - but actually the strongest passwords can
46:26 - just have a bunch of words
46:28 - so we're going to have a teacher and a
46:30 - student join us to make this
46:31 - so the the teacher is katie o'brien
46:33 - katie are you there with us
46:36 - hi yes i am
46:38 - so katie uh used to be a math teacher
46:41 - and she decided to teach computer
46:42 - science and code.org put her through
46:45 - training to learn to become a computer
46:47 - science teacher she loved it so much
46:48 - that then she started training and
46:50 - preparing other computer science
46:51 - teachers and we loved her work so much
46:53 - that then she joined the code.org team
46:56 - to help run the professional learning
46:57 - program that is teaching computer
46:58 - science to teachers all around the
47:00 - country over 100 000 new computer
47:03 - science teachers have gone through this
47:04 - training so she's going to introduce a
47:06 - student
47:07 - at
47:08 - yes we have nina with us
47:11 - hello
47:14 - nina where are you from
47:16 - i'm from the twin cities in minnesota
47:19 - twin cities in minnesota and you took
47:21 - our cs principles class with code.org
47:23 - last year is that right i did
47:26 - great did you like it
47:28 - i did like the class it was one of the
47:30 - most enjoyable classes i took last year
47:33 - that's awesome yes cs principles has now
47:35 - become the most popular computer science
47:36 - class in the in high schools all around
47:39 - the country so for any student out there
47:41 - who's in high school i encourage you to
47:43 - take cs principles if your school offers
47:45 - it and if your school doesn't offer it
47:47 - please ask the principal to add it to
47:48 - the school calendar
47:50 - so now let's build our app to make
47:51 - strong passwords katie are you ready can
47:53 - you walk us through it and have me yeah
47:55 - nina's gonna screen share for us and
47:58 - she's gonna actually build it out of
47:59 - herself you know you ready to share your
48:02 - screen
48:02 - got it
48:04 - awesome
48:05 - all right so nina here is in a blank app
48:08 - um there's nothing there um and we're
48:10 - gonna just kind of show you how to get
48:12 - some of the user interface or the ui set
48:15 - up so nina will you switch into design
48:18 - mode here we are
48:21 - all right fantastic um and she's gonna
48:25 - drag over some of the design toolbox
48:27 - elements let's just do a button and a
48:29 - label for right now
48:31 - here we have the button and the label
48:34 - fantastic
48:36 - now she can very easily change how it
48:38 - looks by changing the theme of the app
48:40 - she could also change the individual
48:43 - colors to make it something she likes
48:44 - but if you click on the background nina
48:48 - and then select a few different themes
48:49 - that you think are interesting
48:51 - okay let's see what we got
48:54 - let's go let's see what robot looks like
48:59 - okay
49:00 - it's not my favorite
49:02 - yeah okay let's what's another
49:05 - what's another uh
49:09 - you know ketchup and mustard really call
49:11 - in my name that seems like a winner i
49:13 - like that yeah all right so we can do
49:15 - all sorts of different themes in there
49:16 - um so that's design mode in app lab but
49:20 - it's not
49:21 - where we're going to be working today
49:22 - we're going to be working in code mode
49:25 - so um nina can you go to our app that we
49:28 - are designing here it is
49:31 - all right excellent and it looks like we
49:33 - have a little bit of extra stuff on the
49:35 - screen we're just going to ignore that
49:36 - for right now
49:38 - no idea what it is
49:40 - that's okay uh so here we've got our
49:42 - user l interface on the left hand side
49:44 - all set up for us already um and we have
49:47 - a list of words that we might use in our
49:49 - password if you're a panelist who's on
49:52 - the screen right now
49:54 - can you click on the chat in the right
49:57 - hand corner and type some words that you
50:00 - think we should have included in our
50:02 - word list for our passwords
50:10 - so i'm seeing baby nina do you want to
50:12 - add that
50:14 - frog
50:16 - i can't spell oh my gosh
50:21 - okay baby
50:22 - yep let's do frogs
50:26 - oh my god okay
50:30 - and jellyfish
50:32 - oh jellyfish
50:37 - jellyfish are so cool
50:44 - all right so we just added a few more
50:46 - things to our
50:48 - word list here
50:50 - um and we're going to
50:52 - want the app to make a password for us
50:54 - when we hit click me so for that we're
50:57 - going to need an event handler you know
51:00 - we drag one of those out from us for us
51:02 - there we go
51:03 - great and then you're going to switch it
51:05 - so that when they click on the click me
51:07 - button this stuff will happen whatever
51:09 - we tell the computer we want it to do
51:12 - there we go
51:13 - awesome great
51:15 - um from there we're going to want the
51:16 - computer to take some information from
51:18 - the user we're going to want it to take
51:21 - the number of words in the password
51:22 - which is going to be shown by the slider
51:25 - and then we're going to want to have it
51:26 - create a password so nina can you make
51:28 - two new variables for me please one for
51:31 - the
51:33 - number of words and one for our new
51:34 - password okay
51:36 - so let's make a
51:39 - password
51:42 - and this is going to be
51:44 - which we call it word number yeah that's
51:47 - good
51:53 - all right great um and so our word
51:56 - number is going to be give got or we're
51:59 - going to get our word number from the
52:01 - slider there so why don't you go ahead
52:03 - and get number
52:07 - and we're going to get it from that
52:08 - slider
52:12 - and then our password we don't have it
52:14 - yet so we're just going to give it an
52:17 - empty string so we're just going to do
52:18 - quote unquote
52:23 - [Music]
52:25 - great all right thanks nina
52:27 - all right you know so next we need to
52:29 - make our new password and so we wanted
52:32 - to add things to this password over and
52:35 - over again from our word list so what
52:37 - are we going to need to use if we want
52:39 - to do something over and over again in
52:41 - our code
52:42 - we are going to want a
52:44 - loop
52:45 - excellent
52:46 - gonna grab our loop for us
53:02 - all right
53:03 - yeah
53:04 - all right so our loop is going to run um
53:07 - some number of times and we want it to
53:09 - run as often as
53:12 - we want that like password link to be or
53:15 - the number of words in our password to
53:17 - be so um
53:19 - what's going to go there instead of four
53:21 - because we don't want it to run
53:22 - necessarily four times
53:25 - we can reference the word number
53:28 - variable yeah so we want it to run a
53:30 - word number times
53:36 - all right um and so now let's go ahead
53:38 - and let's build our password so every
53:40 - time we go through this loop we want to
53:42 - add something new to our password so
53:45 - we're going to update the value stored
53:46 - in password
53:51 - and let's switch over to text mode for
53:54 - this i think that might be easy for us
53:56 - easier for us nina
53:58 - i agree
54:01 - all right
54:02 - so uh we're gonna update this password
54:05 - so it takes our old password
54:12 - and it adds to it a random
54:16 - word from our word list
54:18 - so in order to get a random
54:21 - word from our word list we have to get a
54:24 - random number the reason for that is is
54:26 - because
54:27 - every single item in our list
54:30 - has a number associated with it so for
54:32 - example apple is the first item in the
54:35 - list just like you write out a grocery
54:37 - list it's the first one but it's actual
54:40 - number associated with with it is zero
54:42 - so we're going to want to get a random
54:44 - element from that list that starts at
54:46 - zero to the very end so um to access
54:50 - that
54:51 - uh value good nina you got it you got
54:53 - the word list and we're going to want to
54:55 - access the element at a random number
54:58 - so
54:59 - uh wordless square bracket
55:04 - 0 to ran
55:07 - yeah wait yup you got it yeah
55:11 - so you have to make sure i think we want
55:14 - the random number first yeah random
55:16 - number
55:18 - parenthesis
55:22 - and then we want to go to the end of the
55:24 - list because we might want to add more
55:25 - words in here so we're going to do
55:28 - wordlist.length
55:34 - and uh we're gonna do minus one because
55:38 - we don't wanna go off the length of our
55:40 - list
55:41 - good all right
55:43 - let's uh
55:44 - yeah we can go back to blocks i think
55:46 - that's a good idea
55:48 - looks like everything's good all right
55:50 - let's go ahead and run our program and
55:51 - test it out
55:52 - okay moment of truth will she work
55:55 - okay we're gonna do like three-ish words
55:58 - okay password and
56:01 - nothing happened
56:03 - okay
56:03 - why do you think that is nina
56:07 - we never
56:08 - told our program to put anything on the
56:12 - screen to tell us what our password is
56:14 - exactly so we maybe did update the
56:16 - password but it's just not showing up on
56:18 - the screen so the user can't see it at
56:21 - all so let's set the text of that text
56:23 - area to be our new password
56:30 - area is called
56:33 - password output
56:35 - and we're going to set it to
56:39 - password
56:41 - excellent so that's going to take what's
56:43 - stored in password and throw it on the
56:44 - screen for us all right now let's test
56:46 - it okay
56:48 - second try
56:50 - three words sounds good okay and
56:52 - password
56:54 - jellyfish frog apple
56:56 - it's a password let's try it again make
56:59 - sure it still works
57:02 - click it baby apple sloth i kind of like
57:05 - that one
57:06 - baby apple sloth yeah i'm sure a
57:07 - computer would have a hard time guessing
57:09 - it yeah
57:10 - um and
57:12 - yeah you want to try the slider too to
57:13 - make sure it works yes let's go let's go
57:15 - five words max it out okay
57:20 - frog jellyfish apple baby jellyfish
57:24 - that would take me a while to type out
57:26 - but it would be a stronger password for
57:27 - sure okay thanks nina um you'll see that
57:30 - the possible passwords is left blank
57:33 - that's going to be a challenge for the
57:34 - rest of the audience to do for uh on
57:36 - your own time so we'll finish that a
57:38 - little bit later but i think we've have
57:40 - a really good start to our app thanks
57:41 - nina
57:42 - thank you
57:43 - thank you so much nina and katie uh so
57:46 - that app that we just built on the fly
57:48 - lets you create your own password but it
57:50 - only had uh seven or eight words in it
57:53 - uh and i actually made a copy of nina's
57:55 - app right now because any of you might
57:57 - want to actually make your passwords a
57:59 - little stronger
58:00 - this version of this app right now it
58:02 - has a word list of 1200 simple words in
58:05 - it that we downloaded from the internet
58:07 - i basically copied nina's code and then
58:09 - added
58:10 - many more words so this is the same
58:13 - exact app but you can have
58:15 - it generate a password of five words uh
58:18 - land rogue patch chute mocha
58:22 - and it can basically make passwords for
58:23 - you if you want this uh you can
58:27 - scan this qr code and have it on your
58:29 - own phone and make strong passwords from
58:32 - now on that are easy to remember
58:34 - and we're actually going gonna use this
58:35 - app for the challenges for this week and
58:38 - so that gets us to this week's
58:39 - challenges
58:41 - uh
58:42 - we want you to try to use this app and
58:43 - improve on it and there's a number of
58:44 - ways you can do that uh so
58:48 - if you enjoyed this show what we want
58:49 - you to do is to take a look at this
58:51 - week's challenges which will send you an
58:53 - email
58:54 - if you haven't signed up already enter
58:56 - your email address at code.org break
58:59 - if you do that within the next hour
59:00 - we'll send you this week's challenges
59:03 - and then what those challenges are going
59:04 - to include a bunch of things first of
59:06 - all you get to get a piece of paper uh
59:08 - that you can print out to make a caesar
59:10 - cipher widget just like ashton kutcher
59:12 - had for the younger kids you can then
59:14 - actually make your own secret messages
59:16 - and make and basically share them with a
59:19 - sibling or with your mom and dad and
59:20 - have one of you make a message and one
59:22 - of you try to decode that message for
59:24 - the younger kids that's lots of fun
59:26 - sophia and her brother
59:27 - yes sophia and her brother didn't spend
59:29 - all weekend doing this
59:31 - and if you're a little more uh
59:33 - interested in trying one of the harder
59:34 - challenges what you can do is take the
59:36 - app that we just got that we uh that
59:39 - nina built for us and add a bunch of
59:41 - improvements to it as we can improve the
59:43 - interface we can basically count how
59:46 - many types of passwords or how hard a
59:48 - password is to crack one of the
59:50 - challenges is to show uh whether a
59:52 - password is weak or strong depending on
59:54 - the password that was created
59:56 - so please to get each week's challenges
59:59 - sign up with your email at code.org
60:01 - break
60:02 - and what we're going to do like we just
60:03 - did this week is whoever sends us in uh
60:06 - what they created we're going to
60:08 - showcase on the show next week with next
60:10 - week's special guest whether that's if
60:11 - you created its super cool secret
60:13 - message that you want us to encrypt or
60:15 - whether you made a really nice version
60:16 - of an improvement on nina's app
60:20 - lastly if you have feedback on how we
60:22 - can improve please fill out the survey
60:23 - that we send you an email as well if you
60:25 - enjoyed this show please spread the word
60:27 - about code break we want each of us
60:30 - every person here to invite at least one
60:31 - other or two other families to join us
60:34 - next week to to hopefully grow the the
60:37 - code break audience each week
60:39 - i want to say as we part ways thank you
60:41 - to all of our students on camera so if
60:43 - we could switch to gallery mode and
60:45 - everybody wave your hands
60:47 - we're done with today's code break thank
60:48 - you so much and extra special thanks to
60:51 - our special guests uh ashton kutcher and
60:54 - mia gil eppinger if you're studying
60:56 - alone take a code break
60:58 - thank you everybody and have a wonderful
61:01 - day
61:36 - hmm
61:39 - [Music]
61:59 - [Music]
62:11 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hi everybody and welcome to code break last week we had over 18 000 total viewers between zoom and facebook this week we have viewers from all around the world not only throughout the united states but as far south as chile and as far east as india and even china we have viewers coming from from new york from spain together we're hoping to build the world's largest live interactive classroom if you whether you're a student or a parent joining us today if you're enjoying this uh and if you enjoy the whether it's the community or the education please invite other parents and families to join us together we're hoping to build the world's largest live interactive classroom to provide not only education in an hour of child care at a time when students are at home but also a sense of community in a place people can get together at this time when we're all studying alone uh i want to introduce my daughter and sidekick sophia to join and today we have two very special guests joining us uh renowned actor and entrepreneur ashton kutcher ashton are you there with us i'm here how's it going good how are you doing i'm lovely and then we have cyber security professional and former nsa engineer mia gillepner mia are you there i am hi everyone good to see you mia good to see you too where are you joining us from today mia i am joining from berkeley california in my living room and you now work at a cyber security company called expanse but you used to work for the department of defense in this sort of spy agency i'm looking forward to hearing about your work later but we're going to start for the first 20 minutes with ashton because he has a limited amount of time uh ashton where are you calling from i'm calling from my house in los angeles all right so what have you been doing with all this extra time we have well i've been in my house now uh for about four and a half weeks uh and um i have two kids one's five and one's three so we're spending a lot of time uh doing home school uh and we figured out uh as many of you have figured out that the best way to do homeschool is to actually outsource it and so we have a lot of our friends calling in with 30 minute teach me anythings uh with our kids which has been just awesome uh and uh trying to do a little bit of work we have a lot of companies at soundventures which is my investment fund and a lot of these companies uh given the sort of economic times that we're all about to face are facing a lot of changes so i've been working with a lot of them as to how how they can make the changes inside their companies um in order to sort of not only survive but thrive through this period of time and uh beyond that i've been working hard to get uh ppe personal protective equipment uh to hospitals around the country and uh figuring out how to get uh broadbased testing um uh syndicated as widely as possible so uh just you know pounding it away and trying to do my best to stay and stay busy um but also just having a lot of fun um i find i don't spend a lot of time at home because i end up working so much so it's really exciting for me to actually just be home and and get like find the precipice of being bored uh because because when you finally let your mind get to the point where your boy that's when you start to get creative i think yeah well for the homeschooling for your fiveyearolds you're welcome to have them join code break each week for one hour uh our our show starts with stuff that the youngest kids can even follow along so at least the first half hour of it should be pretty fun um do you have any thoughts to share with the students who are all at home while school is closed basically all around the country and all around the world almost a billion students are now at home yeah i mean here's the thing when i was in school this was like a this would be like a dream like not having to go to school would seem like it would be like a dream for me so but then you're faced with the reality of it you're like wait a second i kind of want to hang out with my friends and actually uh when i'm at school it's really fun and i learn things and so uh i guess my advice is is like actually the the coolest thing is when you're at school all the time you kind of have to do and learn just what everybody else is learning and when you're doing homeschooling stuff you may have a little bit more time to learn and focus on the things that you really care about and and and build things um because i really do think that that the brightest and and coolest things that are going to be built are going to be built by you guys um and you're you're you are you are building the future right now whether you know it or not uh because the the thoughts and ideas that you're getting in your head um those are going to be the future and and i'm excited to live in your future all right well i'm home with my family as well my daughter sophia joins us each week partly to learn partly to keep me in check she's got an app to make sound effects you want to make us a sound effect right now um so she's my daughter and a student and a cohost and also part of the production crew and we're going to be fantastic we're going to start with this week's computer joke of the day with sophia so ashton what clothing does a computer programmer wear a hoodie nope whatever is in the dress code the dress code all right yeah i have to give a dad joke once a week um let's meet some of the live audience who's on camera we have dozens of students on camera uh can everybody wave and say hi to ashton hey also learn a bit about the rest of our audience uh those of you who've been joining us each week you may notice that we've disabled the chat feature it's only accessible to the folks who are live on camera you can still see what those folks are typing if you click chat but we had to disable this because last week some students use very offensive language i've written personal letters to the students who acted this way giving them a chance to apologize and we establish a code of conduct for code break to make sure everybody behaves in a way that's consistent with being a respectful young adult whether in a classroom or a future career but we still have the opportunity to engage our entire audience interactively even without chat for example to find out where everybody's from we use the geographic poll and i'm going to screen share this and ash and mia you can let us know if you're surprised from one of some of the places that people are calling in from wow that is impressive there's a lot of people from antarctica that it seems i want to be in antarctica right now you you wouldn't have to worry about getting coronavirus that is that's true there's people as far east as china where it's very late in their day now let's do another live poll we want to get a sense of what grade the students are in so we're going to post a live poll to see to have everybody enter your grade and this is going to come up on your screen sofia you want to fill out your poll right there all right we're getting the answers coming in it seems like the biggest group is in in sixth to eighth grade but there's literally all grades represented wow all right could we uh around 70 800 of you have voted so these are the poll results for what grade students earn we have kindergarteners all the way through 12th grades and at least 16 of our audience is beyond k12 let's do another poll to find out your computer science experience level because there's people who are total beginners and people who are advanced and we want to have something for everybody so if you could all enter your levels sophia you can enter yours too and what we're going to do each week is we start with material that's great for the beginners and then we'll get more and more advanced so if you're a beginner the fast stuff at the end even if you can't follow along you should just try to watch it because you learn a little bit and if you're more advanced uh it doesn't matter to if we'd love for you to be patient to the early stuff we'll try to make something that everybody can learn all right we have 70 of the audience having uh voted so if we could share those results on screen as well all right yeah you can see that majority of the group are intermediate uh so as we go through this i i can i can i just say something about watching advanced people work um you know i always think about uh you know programming or anything like this i always think about it like uh watching like a basketball game or a professional football game or something like that like when you watch people who are really really great and professionals and advanced at something it gives you ideas and inspires how you can potentially work so it's really important to watch people that are better at you doing stuff because you'll learn tricks and ideas and and things that and even though you don't completely understand why they're doing everything they're doing or how they're doing it you can get inspired from it and someday you'll see yourself and look back and go oh wait i remember when i was watching that that person that was way better than me doing something so just think about like watching like the nba or something like that we don't have to be that good at basketball to watch and enjoy the nba absolutely by the way for the folks who are not going to be on camera and really for all of you if you have questions during this episode there's a q button for q a button which you can click to submit questions the team at code.org will answer many of your questions live in real time and we're going to have some of the best questions read out for ashton and also from mia gil ebner tweet for us at today's episode we're going to learn about encryption we're going to have three segments first we're going to learn about a simple cipher next we're going to learn about password strength which is something the adults can even benefit from and lastly we're going to in real time code an app to help us make passwords that are stronger than the ones you probably use uh this is our third time doing this kind of a live interactive format with thousands of people on one zoom call so we are going to have glitches when we have glitches we're going to learn an important computer science concept called debugging this is bug and so please bear with us if we have any issues as we go uh so before we start the lesson we want to welcome two student groups to demo their creations from last week last week's challenge was to create an app or an interactive card and each week when you share your creations with us we'll invite you on the show next week to share them so first i'd like to introduce hannah christina pratusha sophia and lily this is a five person team uh can you all say hi so we can see you hi and can we switch to gallery view as well so we can so folks can see all these students all right um so uh hannah can you say hello and tell us where you're all from and introduce your teammates yes we're all from franklin massachusetts and franklin high school my uh teammates are lily sophia ceramides patricia nadori and elizabeth fall all right uh so i'm gonna put your app on screen share and then you can describe the app uh for and for ashton to basically react to it so give me just one second and this is the app that the this group made as a team all right can you all see my app all right you're going to go ahead and tell us about it so the app we develop is based on the mental health issues that occur among adolescents the prevalence of mental health issues is largest among young adults with approximately one in five teens suffering from at least one mental health disorder these disorders can have a significant impact on daily life and overall wellbeing our goal is to create an app that aided students in resolving these issues through the use of various resources right at their fingertips based on the structure of the app no matter what conflict the student is experiencing the app provides a solution accordingly the user begins by signing in or logging in from there they choose a userfriendly emoji representing the current emotion they are then prompted to select the category a problem that they are facing if any from there students are provided with multiple paths eventually resulting in a problemspecific solution for the student with over 20 screens the app allows for a resolution to almost any problem equipped with back buttons so students are able to navigate easily between screens especially if they are facing multiple issues our hope is that with our app teams will be more equipped with the skills they need to develop socially and emotionally thank you wow so if i want to try this app tell me what should i do i guess i should click the welcome button yes yeah all right i'm not going to log in or sign up i'll use it as a guest so let's check in ashton how are you feeling today uh i'm i'm feeling fantastic well that's pretty good all right the app is glad to see you're doing so well let's pretend thank you thank you app of course let's try it again and pretend we're not feeling as good to see what hannah and her team have prepared so what's a less good feeling mission i am devastated and really sad and crying what is bothering you what is bothering me oh boy i'm just stressed out about my future plans future plans all right are you worried more about college or your standardized tests oh man i'm uh i'm worried about college it seems that i didn't go first or finding a college i think it sounds like getting into college is your warrior probably i should try to get into a college since i've never gone well i i quit i dropped out so all right so if you're worried about getting your grades or upcoming assessments here's some resources so for regardless of which subject you're in there's resources and websites that helped you study in this app oh great that's right that's wonderful uh let's switch to the next app and the next student is sophie here with us as well hi hi sophie where are you calling from bellevue washington bellevue washington can you tell us about your app and then we'll screenshare it and go through a demo yeah so as a teen entrepreneur myself of a fashion backpack business called tashan bags i understand the value and importance of small businesses in our time especially with the coronavirus so our local restaurants are truly the heart of our community and bellevue bites offers a list of restaurants updated daily near you that are offering takeout delivery discounts because a lot of people are on a tight budget right now but still want to afford to support local businesses so right now bellevue bites serves the seattle and bellevue area but we hope to evolve in the future and unlike ubereats and other food apps that charge restaurants a fee per order bellevue bites lets the restaurant keep all the profits and provides a free promotional platform we hope to help the local economy grow along with the small businesses that make it unique thank you all right and how do i get into this app i guess i should click to find a restaurant near me to find a restaurant near you and then right now it's in the seattle moby area so let's say you're in seattle um so then now we have exclusive discounts with restaurants that are partnered with us and if you click on their logo you can be taken to the website for example um yeah so it'll go it'll take you eventually to the website and it's just a great way for small businesses to connect and a resource for people in the community well thank you so much for making this app and for doing your part to help small businesses deal with the crisis we're in uh these apps are all built on code.org lab uh and we are going to be by the end of this episode demoing how easy it is to make your own app uh hey sophie that app is awesome can i give you can i give you can i give you one piece of advice so on every single page that you create with an app and this is like this is the same advice like i i gave and i actually learned this from kevin sinstrom who created instagram uh and and what he always said to me about product when i was learning about product really early on he was like every single page of any app that you have you have one thing that you want the customer to do the most and and you have to make sure that that one thing you want the customer to do the most is the most prominent thing and the easiest thing for them to actually click and so it was funny when hadi was uh looking at your homepage he was had to kind of search for where to push right like what the first thing to click was because it was kind of hidden down in the bottom so you try to try to always think about like what do you what do you as the creator want the user to do on every single page and make sure that that is has some that is featured in some way that that makes them think oh i should probably push this yeah yeah yeah so it's more yeah i see what you're saying completely yeah awesome thank you great yeah sure so today we want to start today's lesson and what we're going to learn about is encryption so today's computer science word of the day is encryption uh thank you sophia for making this sound for us uh encryption is how we protect data by changing it into something secret that nobody else can figure out unless they decrypt it and we're going to learn one of the most simple ways to do this um but ashton i first want to ask what are some examples of why it's important to protect data whether you're when you're using any of the top web sites or apps in the world yeah i so so one of the first things is is that you know i'm everybody out there probably everybody on this call is a really good person that's trying to do really good things in the world and there are some people out there that are that don't have everybody's best intentions in mind and when our our information and our data is on different different services and there's all kinds of things that can be on on different services so like your what kind of phone you have where you're at when you're using your phone if you buy things and you put a credit card credit card information in in into your phone or onto a website all that information gets stored in databases and when we're communicating back and forth and when these websites are communicating back and forth if that data isn't safe and sometimes we let's say we go to uh you know a shopping platform and it's a brand new shopping platform it's only a very little company and you put your information in there if that company goes out of business sometimes other companies buy your information from that from that company and next thing you know you have somebody who you really don't you wouldn't give your credit card information to or somebody that you really wouldn't give personal information to now they've got your data and so making sure that that who we are where we are who our friends are what our banking or credit card information is is protected is really really important because once it's on the internet a lot of people can can steal it and take it and use it for for bad things to steal money from us to hurt people uh and and ultimately to pretend like they're you if they want to and then they can go to other websites pretending like they're you and and spend your money that way or ruin your reputation like imagine if somebody didn't really like you very much and they wanted to make you other people think that you were a bad person they could take your identity and use it on another platform and make you look like a really bad person by saying some really mean things to people and doing nasty stuff and we don't want to we don't want that to happen so today we're going to learn about a really simple form of encryption using a simple cipher known as a caesar cipher which was once used by emperor julius caesar in the roman empire ashton did you get the packet that we sent you this packet yeah it said don't open it until the live episode uh so i assume you'll see it still sealed it is encrypted at this point within this envelope all right so can you open it for us right now of course i can this is this is the most rudimentary form of encryption put it in a package ahha we have here a wheel do you have a wheel that's a caesar cipher that sophia made for you i did not you drew it we were supposed to say that you made it no you did all right fine i gave it up well i made it i even called out that beautiful flower to make it look like an 11 year old made it sofia was busy doing homework but what that wheel does you see two wheels inside each other and if you turn each one of them what it does is it can give you instructions to replace one letter of the alphabet with a different letter of the alphabet to basically encode a message or to encrypt a message what we're going to do is ashton is going to pick a secret message and he's going to use this wheel to encrypt it and i want you to choose a oneword message to make it really simple and pick a position on the wheel and and map from one letter to another to to create a secret message and our entire live audience is gonna try to decrypt your message all at the same time so while ashton is encrypting i'm gonna show some slides now for what we want everybody else to do so that you can basically decrypt ashton's message so whoever is there on the audience whether you're on camera or not take a look at my screen for what i want you all to do at just one second i'm sharing my screen just right now okay there we go all right can you see my screen so what ashton had there is a caesar cipher built in a wheel but what we're going to do is do it on paper so you're going to have an alphabet that looks like this but each one of you is going to have a different version of this just like turning one of the wheels so there's a different point in the alphabet mapping one letter to another letter and some of you will get lucky if you get the right key to match to what action encrypts with so what i want you to do is take a piece of paper turn it sideways and at the top of the piece of paper write the alphabet but plan ahead so you don't run out of space when sophia did this the first time she ran out of space that's better this time so write the letters a through z all across the top next you want to pick a letter between b and z this is your secret key it's like a password and you're trying to guess the secret key that ashton has picked after you pick your secret key write another alphabet directly below it starting at the letter you picked and letter by letter go underneath those ones and write all the other letters of the alphabet and when you reach the end of the page at z you want to start over yeah you want to start over at the letter a i'm going to give you a little bit of time to do this for the students who are in the audience and can i ask if you're in the audience trying to do this when you finish can you raise your hand so we have a sense that you're done before we go on to the next step so you're going to need to end up writing two alphabets and each of you is going to be choosing a different key all right my computer is getting a little overloaded from all these hands being raised wow all right so what as you're doing this i'm going to go through to explain what you're going to do next is ashton is going to say his secret message he's going to read it letter by letter as he does that you want to write that down lower down on your piece of paper and then for each letter that ashton reads you want to find that letter in the top row of your cipher and look at the letter right below it and write that letter right below in the message and that way you can translate and some of you one out of 25 of you will have picked the same secret key as ashton and you'll be able to decrypt his message so it's going to be a question of who gets lucky to decrypt his message everybody who's live on camera has been given a different secret key so we'll all be able to do this together at the same time and see which ones of us can decode ashton's message so ashton are you ready with your secret super double extra secret message i'm ready with my double extra super secret extra super duper duper the most secretist message of all ever to been created that was secret all right secret all right so can you read out the letters one by one and everybody write them down as ashton reads them are you ready yes r d i repeat r d as in duck s as in simon t as in top all right so those of you who are in the audience if you get the right answer we want you to actually can we lower the hands of everybody who's in the live in in the audience in the not on screen if you're on screen raise your hand let's switch to gallery view so we can see all the students at the same time and if you get the right answer please raise your hand and wave your hand and this is if you basically get a letter a word that you can can read and it's a real english word raise your hand and it looks like about 43 people in the entire audience or 47 people in the audience got the right answer and one student has raised their hand uh can you can we unmute him i think this is eat cass casts hello yeah so so the message is called code wow that's a great secret code where are you calling us from india wow and what was ashton's secret key in this case uh rdst let's see so we were able to so we were able to solve this as humans with only a thousand of us in just a minute and we didn't have only one person do the work we had all of us spreading the work multiple people doing it at the same time so some of us got lucky to solve solve it correctly that's using a computer science concept called distributed computing we spread the work we distributed the work with multiple people doing it at the same time but let's see how long it would take for a computer to decrypt a similar message what we're going to do now is we're going to have a a computer app that basically does the same kind of encryption that you all did but it does it much much faster and i'm going to demo this and then ashton is going to encrypt another message so ashton uh would you mind encrypting another message while i show this to everybody sure i'm on it right now all right thank you so much uh so this here is a widget on code.org and we're going to send this to the email where you can write a message so i'm going to write ashton's original message rdst and you can see the secret message here and over here it shows what each of these letters is being replaced with and then i can shift them one by one letter by letter to see a change with each mapping you can see these letters here shift and a different version of ashton's secret message and if we click enough times we get to the right answer which is code so we are going to now do this again with another secret message and for all of you sophia is going to use the computer here sophia are you ready yes and ashton if you could read out your secret message and again we want everybody to to write theirs and you're going to be racing against the computer which sophia is going to be using so asham let's let's hear your new message n r j y space p f l i space y r e u jay all right so now sophia is going to try to decrypt this using the computer while students in the live audience if anybody in the live audience gets it faster than sophia raise your hands if you get it faster than sophia wow there's already 15 people who raised their hands and beat the computer at doing this it's going lower and lower oh i think you passed it there's ashton's super secret message extremely secret ashton was this your message that was my message wash your hands wash your hands and it looks like your key was the letter no the little letter r why is it why is your secret message wash your hands well because right now with the coronavirus the best thing that we can all do for ourselves to keep ourselves safe and keep the people around us safe is wash our hands and so whenever we touch something or a surface that we think anybody else has touched like a doorknob or a handle in a bathroom or a faucet sink and faucet handle or a table or flat surface the best thing we can do is wash our hands because the one thing that we know about this coronavirus is that it does not like soap right so one thing we also saw is that a lot of students were even faster than sophia and the computer at decrypting ashton's message and that's partly because we use distributed computing it's also because the secret key action picked was just a letter from b through z it's like a password that's one letter long and there's only 25 options so it wasn't hard to crack but we're going to learn about stronger passwords soon as we learn more about encryption but before ashton leaves we want to give the audience one last chance to ask him a question we have the students who are live on camera submit a bunch of questions and i want to introduce dior dior cease are you there with us hi i just wanted to ask um what have you learned about success and what do you think would be helpful for students to know what have i learned about success um i think the biggest thing that i've learned is that doing great things is uncomfortable um it's it it when you work really hard it's uncomfortable and the more that you can do things that are uncomfortable and that are a little bit hard and that are a little bit of a stretch for you the more comfortable those things become and the next thing you know you're doing really really really hard things that you couldn't have imagined yourself doing and it seems easy um and and i think the biggest thing that i've learned through my my career and the advice that i would give myself if i was your age is that the people who are building the coolest things in the world and the people that you look up to and admire the most they're no smarter than you are they don't have some special gift they don't have some special thing that you don't you've got it too and you've got to believe that you've got it and the more that you believe that you've got it the cooler things the greater things that you'll build in this world and you'll be the person that builds the things that other people are looking at going wow how did she do that i wish i could be a little bit more like dior well thank you so much ashton for your time with us at i know we ran a little bit later than we expected i hope you stay healthy and safe can the audience all say goodbye to ashton let's switch to gallery so we can see everybody everybody say goodbye sophia do you want to hit a little sound thank you so much ashley oh thank you thank you i appreciate it i hope to talk to you all soon all right keep up the good work thank you byebye uh all right mia we're gonna switch to you as mia there i am here hello all right so mia used to work for the national security agency the nsa which is one of the top spy agencies in the world even while she was a college student uh studying computer science working for the nsa is like the cyber security equivalent of joining the navy seals it's like the ultimate elite uh so i first wanted to ask what did it take to get in so it's not as hard as it might seem there are obviously some security concerns so you need to make sure that you pass a clearance investigation you need to take a polygraph stuff like that but in terms of computer science knowledge really i just had to be willing to learn and willing to study computer science so at the time i was in college i was majoring in computer science with a focus in cyber security and a lot of the things that i did at my job i learned on the job there are things that they teach you there and um it's meant that it was a great opportunity to get to expand my knowledge past just what my college classes were teaching me great um well we spent a whole bunch of time encrypting secret messages and we used those with a password that was as little as you know going from b through z or single letter but now let's talk about real passwords uh what are some some tips you can give us for creating good passwords well you should definitely never say your real password allowed to anyone especially on a video call with you know a thousand people watching um but anyway hottie what's what's your password nice try let's not talk about my password but sophia what's your password you already know my password wait i'm not the whole message is you're not supposed to share your password don't tell people that i know your password you're supposed to say you don't i'm not going to tell you um but speaking about passwords mia what's the name of your favorite pet in the street you grew up on i'm not going to tell you that one either but jokes aside is it safe to use things like your favorite pet or the street you grew up on for security purposes it's not so for example i talk about my cats ponyboy and dr wisconsin who i love dearly all the time so anyone who knows me just a little bit will know that those are my pets names and that they can try to use that as a security question answer or as a password for any of my accounts i hope none of my friends would do that but they might so if all this information about us is is on the internet in social media and people can figure out things about us why are companies still using these types of things for security questions that's a really good question it's difficult because for security questions you're usually not going to be entering them very frequently so you probably won't remember them that's why it's much easier to use something that you'll never forget like your first cars make and model or your pet or the street you grew up on because these are things that are just you know ingrained in your memory and you won't forget them it's a constant sort of struggle between usability making sure that the system is usable and that you can give an answer versus security giving something that people would not be able to guess so one of the things we want to do is we want the audience to get take a guess at what is the best password to use or the safer password to use the harder one for a computer to guess so we're going to do a live interactive poll and show two password options and we want everybody to guess which is the more secure password which is harder for a computer to guess so could we put the poll up on the screen uh it's still not showing all right there i think we see it so everybody take a guess at which password is more secure azr at d percent one or cat dog house panda bear which of these is harder for a computer to guess all right we have almost half the audience has already taken your guesses all right let's show the results on the screen all right so what you can see is almost everybody guessed that this hard to read pronounced unpronounceable password is more secure it has symbols it has letters it has uppercase letters it has numbers mia what do you think so i think it's a lot harder for a human to maybe guess the first password the one that starts with an a but i think it'll be harder for a computer to guess the second password really so you think everybody's wrong or most everybody's wrong let's let's use an app built on code.org app lab to see which of these passwords is easier or harder so this app is a how secure is your password app and it basically measures how long it would take a computer to to crack a password so the first password we tried was a z 3 at sign d percent one and it says a computer would take two hours to crack this password just two hours which is a lot of time for a computer working uh do you remember the second password sophia what was it do you remember cat dog house panda bear house panda bear that was a much easier password to remember and it would take what is that number it's a big number six trillion trillion years for a computer to crack this password so it turns out mia was right about this and can i ask whether do people like the idea of having an app that measures how fast your password is if you want this app yourself this is the app it's built on app lab this is the code for the app you can see it but if anybody wants to check your own passwords at home if you have a phone you can scan this qr code right here hold your phone camera up to this qr code and the camera should pop up a little url so it will actually take you to the app if you click that notification and you can all type in your own secret passwords don't show it to somebody else but this app will tell you how strong your password is and how fast a computer would be able to crack it for you this is something i think all the adults on the screen and at home could also benefit from because all of us play a role in keeping our computers and our data safe so again you can scan the qr code we'll also send it to you via email as well i'm going to stop the screen share now so so mia why is it more secure to do that long password that had such easy words rather than this super strange one with with the symbols because for computers the thing that matters is how long the password is if you think about having a one character password there are 26 letters nine digits something like 13 special characters so there are you know maybe 50 options that can be that one character password if you have a two character password then you have 50 times 50 options because each character means you have to try everything from the characters before plus everything for that last character every time you add another character to your password it gets even harder it adds more so it's an exponentially increasing problem that means that when you make a password super super long it becomes almost impossible for a computer to use a reasonable amount of time to try to guess that password it has to try every single option before it can get to the one that you've chosen a lot of us have been learning about exponential growth and exponential numbers in the last few weeks uh when we're talking about the spread of a virus but with the length of a password exponential growth and exponential numbers make make the same difference as well before mia says goodbye to us we have time for asking one question so uh do we have questions from the audience uh akira do you have a i want to introduce akira gilbert from code.org she's basically producing code break behind the scenes to to share a question from the audience with us akira are you there hi i am how are you great thank you where are you calling from i'm calling from new york so it's been a great time so far the epicenter in the us all right so what's the question for mia um the question about the app is first of all is it safe to enter your password into a second party app which i think we can answer very well that's a great point you shouldn't enter your app or enter your password into second party apps uh usually because you don't want that app to store the password um in this case we can see the code that we're using for this app you can see that it doesn't store anything so you can be pretty sure that it's just going to calculate the amount of time that it'll take and then it throws it away it won't save it and no one will be able to access it sounds great thanks mia yeah all right yeah in general you should never type your password on a screen on a computer unless you see the lock in the browser without the lock there it's actually dangerous because that means anybody on the internet can read what you're typing whether it's a password or credit card anything it's open for the entire world to to tap into unless you see the lock in the browser all right mia thank you so much for your time and stay safe and healthy uh everybody say goodbye to mia thank you i hope all of you stay safe and healthy as well uh have fun enjoy the rest of this lesson all right thank you all right so next we're gonna switch to uh this week's trivia question it's trivia time so the question is what was the release year of the first commercial computer with a display screen we're gonna put a live pull up for people to see the options so you know all of our computers and phones and everywhere you see a computer right now they have a screen but the question is what was the first computer commercial computer that had a screen because before they didn't have screens uh when was the computer screen introduced there's four different choices we have up on screen uh and it's not obvious which one there is i'm watching the audience live guesses come in and they are all over the map ranging from 1945 all the way to 1976. right if we could put the audience guesses up on screen so it should shows uh some of you thought it was in 1945 the inayak computer this the anayak was a 27 ton computer that actually used punch cards with holes in them to represent information they didn't have screens at the time after the niacc they used paper tape uh to actually show basically the the results of what a computer was calculating would be shown on paper tape uh the correct answer let me share my screen so you can see a photo of this beauty is the pdp1 computer uh built in 1959 this entire thing you see on screen is this giant computer with all these wires and stuff behind it this computer today would fit in the size of a grain of sand almost and this here is the screen that it had this screen didn't have colors it only had one color to show it also couldn't even show words on screen it could only draw lines so if you use the artist app on code.org or logo or things like that we move forward turn left to draw lines that's the only thing it could do or in python or in python yes which sophia does but that's all it had as a screen so that's the answer for today's computer uh trivia question so now i want to switch to the last part of our episode the making of an app to make strong passwords we all saw how it's good to have strong passwords and you don't actually want to have passwords with weird symbols in them unless you can remember them and they're really long but actually the strongest passwords can just have a bunch of words so we're going to have a teacher and a student join us to make this so the the teacher is katie o'brien katie are you there with us hi yes i am so katie uh used to be a math teacher and she decided to teach computer science and code.org put her through training to learn to become a computer science teacher she loved it so much that then she started training and preparing other computer science teachers and we loved her work so much that then she joined the code.org team to help run the professional learning program that is teaching computer science to teachers all around the country over 100 000 new computer science teachers have gone through this training so she's going to introduce a student at yes we have nina with us hello nina where are you from i'm from the twin cities in minnesota twin cities in minnesota and you took our cs principles class with code.org last year is that right i did great did you like it i did like the class it was one of the most enjoyable classes i took last year that's awesome yes cs principles has now become the most popular computer science class in the in high schools all around the country so for any student out there who's in high school i encourage you to take cs principles if your school offers it and if your school doesn't offer it please ask the principal to add it to the school calendar so now let's build our app to make strong passwords katie are you ready can you walk us through it and have me yeah nina's gonna screen share for us and she's gonna actually build it out of herself you know you ready to share your screen got it awesome all right so nina here is in a blank app um there's nothing there um and we're gonna just kind of show you how to get some of the user interface or the ui set up so nina will you switch into design mode here we are all right fantastic um and she's gonna drag over some of the design toolbox elements let's just do a button and a label for right now here we have the button and the label fantastic now she can very easily change how it looks by changing the theme of the app she could also change the individual colors to make it something she likes but if you click on the background nina and then select a few different themes that you think are interesting okay let's see what we got let's go let's see what robot looks like okay it's not my favorite yeah okay let's what's another what's another uh you know ketchup and mustard really call in my name that seems like a winner i like that yeah all right so we can do all sorts of different themes in there um so that's design mode in app lab but it's not where we're going to be working today we're going to be working in code mode so um nina can you go to our app that we are designing here it is all right excellent and it looks like we have a little bit of extra stuff on the screen we're just going to ignore that for right now no idea what it is that's okay uh so here we've got our user l interface on the left hand side all set up for us already um and we have a list of words that we might use in our password if you're a panelist who's on the screen right now can you click on the chat in the right hand corner and type some words that you think we should have included in our word list for our passwords so i'm seeing baby nina do you want to add that frog i can't spell oh my gosh okay baby yep let's do frogs oh my god okay and jellyfish oh jellyfish jellyfish are so cool all right so we just added a few more things to our word list here um and we're going to want the app to make a password for us when we hit click me so for that we're going to need an event handler you know we drag one of those out from us for us there we go great and then you're going to switch it so that when they click on the click me button this stuff will happen whatever we tell the computer we want it to do there we go awesome great um from there we're going to want the computer to take some information from the user we're going to want it to take the number of words in the password which is going to be shown by the slider and then we're going to want to have it create a password so nina can you make two new variables for me please one for the number of words and one for our new password okay so let's make a password and this is going to be which we call it word number yeah that's good all right great um and so our word number is going to be give got or we're going to get our word number from the slider there so why don't you go ahead and get number and we're going to get it from that slider and then our password we don't have it yet so we're just going to give it an empty string so we're just going to do quote unquote great all right thanks nina all right you know so next we need to make our new password and so we wanted to add things to this password over and over again from our word list so what are we going to need to use if we want to do something over and over again in our code we are going to want a loop excellent gonna grab our loop for us all right yeah all right so our loop is going to run um some number of times and we want it to run as often as we want that like password link to be or the number of words in our password to be so um what's going to go there instead of four because we don't want it to run necessarily four times we can reference the word number variable yeah so we want it to run a word number times all right um and so now let's go ahead and let's build our password so every time we go through this loop we want to add something new to our password so we're going to update the value stored in password and let's switch over to text mode for this i think that might be easy for us easier for us nina i agree all right so uh we're gonna update this password so it takes our old password and it adds to it a random word from our word list so in order to get a random word from our word list we have to get a random number the reason for that is is because every single item in our list has a number associated with it so for example apple is the first item in the list just like you write out a grocery list it's the first one but it's actual number associated with with it is zero so we're going to want to get a random element from that list that starts at zero to the very end so um to access that uh value good nina you got it you got the word list and we're going to want to access the element at a random number so uh wordless square bracket 0 to ran yeah wait yup you got it yeah so you have to make sure i think we want the random number first yeah random number parenthesis and then we want to go to the end of the list because we might want to add more words in here so we're going to do wordlist.length and uh we're gonna do minus one because we don't wanna go off the length of our list good all right let's uh yeah we can go back to blocks i think that's a good idea looks like everything's good all right let's go ahead and run our program and test it out okay moment of truth will she work okay we're gonna do like threeish words okay password and nothing happened okay why do you think that is nina we never told our program to put anything on the screen to tell us what our password is exactly so we maybe did update the password but it's just not showing up on the screen so the user can't see it at all so let's set the text of that text area to be our new password area is called password output and we're going to set it to password excellent so that's going to take what's stored in password and throw it on the screen for us all right now let's test it okay second try three words sounds good okay and password jellyfish frog apple it's a password let's try it again make sure it still works click it baby apple sloth i kind of like that one baby apple sloth yeah i'm sure a computer would have a hard time guessing it yeah um and yeah you want to try the slider too to make sure it works yes let's go let's go five words max it out okay frog jellyfish apple baby jellyfish that would take me a while to type out but it would be a stronger password for sure okay thanks nina um you'll see that the possible passwords is left blank that's going to be a challenge for the rest of the audience to do for uh on your own time so we'll finish that a little bit later but i think we've have a really good start to our app thanks nina thank you thank you so much nina and katie uh so that app that we just built on the fly lets you create your own password but it only had uh seven or eight words in it uh and i actually made a copy of nina's app right now because any of you might want to actually make your passwords a little stronger this version of this app right now it has a word list of 1200 simple words in it that we downloaded from the internet i basically copied nina's code and then added many more words so this is the same exact app but you can have it generate a password of five words uh land rogue patch chute mocha and it can basically make passwords for you if you want this uh you can scan this qr code and have it on your own phone and make strong passwords from now on that are easy to remember and we're actually going gonna use this app for the challenges for this week and so that gets us to this week's challenges uh we want you to try to use this app and improve on it and there's a number of ways you can do that uh so if you enjoyed this show what we want you to do is to take a look at this week's challenges which will send you an email if you haven't signed up already enter your email address at code.org break if you do that within the next hour we'll send you this week's challenges and then what those challenges are going to include a bunch of things first of all you get to get a piece of paper uh that you can print out to make a caesar cipher widget just like ashton kutcher had for the younger kids you can then actually make your own secret messages and make and basically share them with a sibling or with your mom and dad and have one of you make a message and one of you try to decode that message for the younger kids that's lots of fun sophia and her brother yes sophia and her brother didn't spend all weekend doing this and if you're a little more uh interested in trying one of the harder challenges what you can do is take the app that we just got that we uh that nina built for us and add a bunch of improvements to it as we can improve the interface we can basically count how many types of passwords or how hard a password is to crack one of the challenges is to show uh whether a password is weak or strong depending on the password that was created so please to get each week's challenges sign up with your email at code.org break and what we're going to do like we just did this week is whoever sends us in uh what they created we're going to showcase on the show next week with next week's special guest whether that's if you created its super cool secret message that you want us to encrypt or whether you made a really nice version of an improvement on nina's app lastly if you have feedback on how we can improve please fill out the survey that we send you an email as well if you enjoyed this show please spread the word about code break we want each of us every person here to invite at least one other or two other families to join us next week to to hopefully grow the the code break audience each week i want to say as we part ways thank you to all of our students on camera so if we could switch to gallery mode and everybody wave your hands we're done with today's code break thank you so much and extra special thanks to our special guests uh ashton kutcher and mia gil eppinger if you're studying alone take a code break thank you everybody and have a wonderful day hmm you
