00:21 - casual but the world around us is
00:24 - constantly changing so we want to adapt
00:26 - the choices we make to match the
00:28 - changing conditions what's true for
00:30 - humans is also true for computer
00:32 - programs we don't want our programs to
00:34 - always run in the same way they should
00:36 - respond to changing
00:38 - conditions in the last video we learned
00:41 - how to use Boolean Expressions to
00:43 - establish whether something is true or
00:45 - false we can now add something called a
00:48 - conditional statement to help guide the
00:50 - computer's decisions based on that
00:52 - information the simplest conditional
00:54 - statement is an if statement it says
00:57 - that if something is true the computer
01:00 - should run a specific block of code
01:03 - let's say that you want to create a
01:04 - program that displays whether or not you
01:06 - are old enough to see a PG-13 movie so
01:10 - the question we want the computer to
01:11 - evaluate is if age is greater than or
01:15 - equal to
01:16 - 13 the question or Boolean expression
01:19 - goes next to the if the block of code we
01:22 - want to run only if the condition is
01:24 - true goes inside the if statement so in
01:28 - our example whenever the expression age
01:30 - greater than or equal to 13 is true the
01:33 - program will write to the screen that
01:35 - you are old enough to see a PG-13
01:38 - movie of course some people will not be
01:41 - old enough in these kinds of situations
01:43 - we will want our programs to do
01:45 - something else when the condition is
01:47 - false in order to do this we will want
01:50 - to expand our if statements to include
01:52 - an else statement the commands contained
01:55 - in this else statement only run if the
01:58 - Boolean condition in the if statement is
02:02 - false you can add an lse statement by
02:04 - either dragging out the if else block or
02:07 - by clicking the plus symbol in the
02:09 - bottom right corner of the if block

Cleaned transcript:

our daily lives are filled with decisions big and small even simple choices like what to wear usually are the result of complex considerations what's the weather going to be like what will you be doing today do you feel like making an impression or keeping it casual but the world around us is constantly changing so we want to adapt the choices we make to match the changing conditions what's true for humans is also true for computer programs we don't want our programs to always run in the same way they should respond to changing conditions in the last video we learned how to use Boolean Expressions to establish whether something is true or false we can now add something called a conditional statement to help guide the computer's decisions based on that information the simplest conditional statement is an if statement it says that if something is true the computer should run a specific block of code let's say that you want to create a program that displays whether or not you are old enough to see a PG13 movie so the question we want the computer to evaluate is if age is greater than or equal to 13 the question or Boolean expression goes next to the if the block of code we want to run only if the condition is true goes inside the if statement so in our example whenever the expression age greater than or equal to 13 is true the program will write to the screen that you are old enough to see a PG13 movie of course some people will not be old enough in these kinds of situations we will want our programs to do something else when the condition is false in order to do this we will want to expand our if statements to include an else statement the commands contained in this else statement only run if the Boolean condition in the if statement is false you can add an lse statement by either dragging out the if else block or by clicking the plus symbol in the bottom right corner of the if block
