00:00 - and pull up
00:07 - welcome everyone to your ecs monthly
00:09 - meeting for october we're really glad
00:11 - that you've been able to join us this
00:13 - evening
00:13 - for the next 45 minutes to an hour we're
00:15 - going to be working together to chat
00:17 - about the exploring computer science
00:19 - curriculum and the code.org program my
00:21 - name is melissa jones i'm a community
00:23 - manager here at code.org and this
00:25 - evening i'm joined by danny mcavoy who's
00:27 - our ecs
00:28 - program manager brooke osborne high
00:30 - school program manager and our special
00:32 - guest eric snow who's a researcher from
00:34 - sri international
00:36 - our goals with these calls as always are
00:38 - to connect as a community and to discuss
00:40 - how the school year is going with your
00:41 - ecs implementation tonight we're really
00:43 - excited to get a tour of the new unit
00:45 - assessment from eric and to get an
00:47 - overview of the phase 3pd from danny and
00:50 - of course at the end of the call
00:51 - there'll be plenty of time for you to
00:52 - share questions concerns and feedback
00:54 - for the group
00:55 - this month we're using blue jeans for
00:57 - our platform um so last month if you
00:59 - joined us we used google hangouts it's
01:00 - slightly different blue jeans is fun and
01:02 - pretty easy to use there's a chat window
01:05 - that's located sort of right above your
01:07 - picture
01:09 - if you or have your video on um and if
01:11 - you click on that you can type in any
01:13 - questions you have for the speaker
01:15 - feedback ideas say hello and introduce
01:17 - yourself it's an easy way to communicate
01:18 - with the moderators
01:20 - and then also you should have a little
01:21 - microphone and a little um video camera
01:24 - icon underneath your picture
01:26 - and you can toggle those on and off if
01:28 - you'd like to speak or share your video
01:31 - stream with others

02:18 - talk
02:18 - so you'll be able to check those out
02:21 - download them there's a scoring guide as
02:23 - well and eric will have a chance to talk
02:24 - about that in a little bit
02:26 - the unit 2 assessment will release
02:28 - november 1st

02:48 - phase online
02:50 - if you haven't received that link or if
02:52 - you're missing information about it you
02:54 - want to email pdfcode.org
02:57 - or you can set put something in the chat
02:59 - window and we'll try and help you out
03:02 - uh last thing is just reminders um
03:05 - as always we'd love for you to add
03:07 - resources to the resource folder uh if
03:09 - you weren't able to make it to our um
03:13 - talk for last month we went over what
03:15 - the resource folder is and how to use it
03:18 - so we can we'll post a link to that
03:20 - video as well in case you want to check
03:22 - it out and see what the resource folder
03:24 - is and lastly always the forum is a
03:27 - great place to ask questions get help
03:30 - talk to other teachers find resources
03:32 - there's been some really great stuff
03:34 - that's been posted lately
03:36 - and some really great sharing so we'd
03:37 - love to see you guys keep that up it's
03:39 - really great to have such an awesome

04:24 - all good everybody can see that
04:28 - okay all right so we're really lucky
04:30 - tonight to have eric with us he's going
04:32 - to talk about the sri assessments uh all
04:35 - the work they've been doing to create
04:37 - these wonderful tests to go along with
04:40 - the um
04:43 - ecs curriculum that you guys already
04:45 - have received
04:46 - we have heard a lot of feedback from
04:48 - teachers that they really want some way
04:50 - to do assessment that schools are really
04:51 - asking for that so it's great to have
04:54 - these resources coming out this year as
04:56 - you're teaching the curriculum
04:58 - and eric's going to overview the unit 1
05:00 - just part of the unit 1 assessment for
05:02 - you and answer questions
05:04 - that you may have about the assessment
05:07 - so i'm going to pass it off to eric
05:10 - great um thank you so should i go ahead
05:12 - and ah you've answered my question
05:14 - slides are right there
05:16 - um can i should i just tell you next
05:18 - screen when i'm ready yep
05:20 - okay great um so thank you very much for
05:24 - and you can all see me is that correct
05:27 - yep
05:28 - okay great uh a little informal tonight
05:30 - i hope that's uh okay i just ended my
05:33 - day um
05:34 - happy to be here really excited to talk
05:36 - to you about the assessments uh you've
05:39 - been waiting quite a long time for them
05:41 - uh for those of you who have been doing
05:43 - ecs for more than one year and those of
05:45 - you who are
05:46 - starting this year it's a good year to
05:47 - start because we are happy to have
05:50 - released kind of the first
05:52 - validated version of the assessments uh
05:55 - for use by teachers and i emphasized
05:58 - that last part because that's really who
06:00 - we created the assessments for we know
06:02 - that there are a lot of other uses and
06:04 - folks that want to use the assessments
06:05 - for other things but
06:07 - um you know from the outset i want to
06:09 - emphasize that we want we did this
06:11 - project to support the teachers using
06:13 - the curriculum and to support the spread
06:15 - of the curriculum and so we're really
06:16 - excited to have this opportunity to
06:19 - talk with code.org teachers who are
06:21 - implementing ecs
06:23 - if you want to go to the next one
06:26 - and just to tell you a little bit about
06:27 - myself as well as as a way of
06:30 - introduction i work at the center for
06:32 - technology and learning at si
06:34 - international in the education division
06:37 - we focus on
06:39 - uh tech you know as the name of the
06:41 - center implies uh technology and
06:43 - education projects
06:45 - both in evaluation and assessment and in
06:48 - different curricular areas
06:50 - science computer science as one of our
06:53 - more recent
06:54 - areas of focus
06:57 - i do a lot of work in assessment
06:59 - development and particularly in
07:01 - assessment validation that's my
07:02 - specialization
07:04 - um i also do evaluation and i'm working
07:06 - on a number of
07:08 - different evaluations uh around
07:10 - computational thinking and game design
07:12 - right now that is
07:14 - nice because it's in the after school
07:15 - environment so that gives me a kind of a
07:18 - spread of uh stuff from both uh in
07:20 - school uh classroom types of
07:22 - environments to
07:24 - after school in the computer science
07:26 - space
07:27 - but as uh
07:29 - as mentioned we have been working on the
07:31 - ecs assessments for about two years now
07:33 - they've gone through two rounds of
07:35 - piloting
07:36 - um primarily in chicago schools but also
07:40 - in other in a few other schools
07:42 - throughout the country as well
07:44 - and
07:45 - we've gone through two rounds of
07:47 - validation for various reasons because
07:48 - really the first time out
07:50 - this was brand new we were dealing with
07:53 - a brand new area of measurement so we
07:54 - really wanted to kind of figure out how
07:56 - to do this right and then the second
07:58 - time around was really about refining
07:59 - the assessment tasks and making sure
08:01 - that
08:02 - we felt comfortable uh with you know
08:04 - releasing them this year because we
08:06 - really knew
08:07 - there was a need to do so
08:09 - so we have we we we are releasing the
08:11 - assessments through the cs10k community
08:14 - of practice website
08:16 - uh most of you i think already know
08:18 - about this website um and it's released
08:21 - as a resource in the ecs open group
08:24 - which means that you have to have a
08:26 - cs10k account
08:28 - and be logged into the website in order
08:30 - to see the available resources one of
08:32 - which is the assessments
08:34 - um excuse me are the assessments and the
08:37 - links are are shown there on the slide
08:39 - um
08:40 - we have a particular schedule for really
08:42 - uh that we're kind of trying to release
08:45 - them on that follows
08:47 - the recommended kind of sequencing and
08:50 - timing of the curriculum if you could
08:52 - proceed to the next slide that'd be
08:54 - great
08:55 - thank you um
08:56 - we've already released unit one um
08:59 - october first and then we're doing
09:01 - pretty much a monthly
09:03 - uh release with some time extra time
09:05 - around the holidays
09:07 - um we do understand that folks
09:10 - are there's different flavors of ecs if
09:12 - you will and we know that some folks are
09:15 - going to be implementing on different
09:17 - schedules
09:18 - and so
09:19 - if that's the case
09:21 - if you are after these dates the
09:23 - assessments are going to remain open for
09:25 - download so that's not a problem but if
09:27 - it's before these dates
09:29 - and you have a special request please go
09:31 - ahead and contact us at that email
09:33 - address
09:34 - and we'll be happy to accommodate you
09:36 - and talk with you about your
09:38 - implementation schedule and how we can
09:40 - make sure you have the assessments you
09:42 - need
09:43 - if you want to proceed to the next slide
09:47 - um so
09:48 - i really wanted to i could say a lot
09:50 - more about her development process and
09:52 - so on and so forth and was going to
09:54 - until uh melissa and danny and others um
09:58 - kindly prompted me to focus in on one of
10:00 - the tasks and some of the scoring for
10:02 - unit one which i think will probably be
10:05 - more relevant to all of you at this
10:06 - point
10:07 - um so
10:10 - before i do that i actually wanted to
10:12 - take a minute to stop and see if there
10:14 - are any questions before i kind of dive
10:16 - into this example if anybody has any
10:19 - questions or has anything they would
10:20 - like to discuss
10:27 - i have no questions so far in the chat
10:29 - pod but if there is anybody that would
10:30 - like to turn their mic on and ask a
10:32 - question or put a question in the chat
10:34 - pod we can make sure it gets answered
10:36 - okay
10:41 - great well i i you know you never know
10:42 - quite how long to wait um i don't i know
10:45 - you have some other uh items on your
10:47 - agenda so i don't want to
10:49 - delay anyone uh this evening um
10:52 - but i did want to dive into an example
10:54 - of a unit one task and particularly
10:56 - focus on the scoring aspects because i
10:58 - think that that is going to be
11:02 - probably one of the more challenging
11:04 - aspects of this for it from the teacher
11:05 - perspective right out the gate and we
11:07 - want to be able to provide what support
11:09 - we can
11:10 - i will say that
11:12 - beyond this presentation to you which is
11:15 - preliminary nature we will be running a
11:17 - series of webinars
11:19 - um come winter and spring
11:22 - around um both scoring and
11:25 - i think more significantly around score
11:28 - interpretation and test use
11:30 - because we really do want to provide
11:32 - support and those will be run through
11:34 - the cs10k
11:35 - community of practice website and
11:37 - particularly maybe i'll be able to come
11:39 - back and talk to you all if uh if things
11:41 - work out well and and uh it fits your
11:44 - schedule
11:45 - so
11:46 - for unit one um
11:48 - task two
11:50 - we have entitled what is computing
11:53 - and
11:54 - what we're really taught and what i want
11:55 - to do here is i want to walk through
11:57 - kind of what we're trying to target with
11:58 - this task
11:59 - and then show you what the task looks
12:01 - like which i think many of you have
12:03 - already seen
12:04 - and then tell you kind of what our
12:06 - rationale is for how we score it
12:08 - um
12:09 - so in terms of the core concepts and
12:11 - learning goals which is in the left most
12:13 - column there
12:14 - um you see that we're trying to target
12:16 - you know the concepts of computers and
12:18 - computing
12:19 - computing versus non-computing tasks and
12:21 - this idea of
12:23 - computer or tele intelligence as it's
12:25 - represented in ecs
12:27 - um and
12:28 - i think in particular we're looking for
12:30 - students to be able to explain the
12:31 - differences
12:32 - between tasks that can and cannot be
12:34 - accomplished with computer
12:36 - um
12:38 - in order to kind of take this down to
12:40 - the assessment level what we're really
12:42 - targeting
12:43 - is a student's ability to explain
12:45 - not significant because we're really
12:47 - targeting their ability to engage in
12:49 - explanation
12:50 - and explain the differences between
12:52 - tasks that can and cannot be
12:54 - accomplished with the computer
12:56 - and
12:57 - um you know so we have this task what is
12:59 - computing students are provided with the
13:01 - scenario and asked to relate it to the
13:03 - types of tasks a robot which in this
13:06 - case represents a computer there are
13:08 - other representations certainly
13:10 - of what a robot can do
13:13 - so if you want to proceed to the next
13:14 - slide
13:16 - so this comes from the actual assessment
13:19 - task in unit one um again it's task two
13:23 - and
13:24 - in this task it's
13:26 - um carla has programmed the robot
13:28 - to select some clothes
13:30 - um
13:31 - and then your the students told what the
13:33 - robot is able to do move around the room
13:35 - open and close doors and pick up and
13:37 - drop objects very simple behaviors
13:40 - um then they were provided with a set of
13:43 - instructions
13:44 - for the robot once the robot is inside
13:46 - the closet to select the clothes
13:49 - there's three sets of instructions
13:50 - they're worded in particular ways
13:53 - and then if you want to go to the next
13:55 - slide
13:58 - in this slide we start to see
14:01 - you know the students engaging with the
14:02 - task after the context of the scenario
14:05 - is laid out
14:07 - their first step is for them to select
14:10 - or identify one step in the three steps
14:12 - that we provided in the task setup that
14:15 - the robot would have difficulty
14:17 - completing we provide those tasks
14:20 - again those those steps again and
14:22 - they're supposed to select one
14:25 - we're not scoring the selection that's
14:27 - not the objective of the task
14:29 - what we really care about is the
14:31 - student's ability to engage in
14:33 - explanation providing rationale for
14:35 - their selection
14:37 - and so first we want to know in part a
14:40 - why the robot would have difficulty
14:42 - completing that task
14:44 - and so this
14:46 - explanation is worth one point student
14:48 - either kind of gets it or doesn't and
14:50 - this is based on a couple iterations of
14:53 - seeing how students respond to this task
14:56 - um keep that in mind this isn't just our
14:58 - best guess this actually comes from
15:00 - um several hundred responses to this and
15:04 - seeing that these are the kinds of
15:05 - things that students do and before we
15:07 - had several points for this explanation
15:10 - and now we really broke it down to just
15:12 - one
15:13 - and really what we want to see is that
15:14 - they should discuss difficulties a robot
15:16 - would have
15:17 - with the steps selected because it would
15:21 - it would eat the step is either not
15:23 - precise for example take out a t-shirt
15:25 - isn't very precise it's very vague
15:28 - um or it's too subjective which
15:31 - take out a hat from the top shelf that
15:32 - matches the outfit
15:34 - might be too subjective
15:36 - so
15:37 - in that case you could get a point for
15:39 - an explanation that went along one of
15:42 - those two lines
15:44 - there might be some other explanations
15:46 - that would make sense as well and that's
15:48 - one of the things is as this assessment
15:50 - evolves
15:52 - and we get more and more responses we'll
15:54 - be the rubric is going to evolve as well
15:56 - so the more types of responses that we
15:59 - see to this the more we're going to be
16:01 - able to refine
16:03 - um this but this is consistent this this
16:06 - way of evaluating the explanation
16:08 - is consistent with
16:11 - both what we're seeing in the the pilots
16:14 - and also in the curriculum
16:16 - if you want to go to the next slide
16:20 - so for part b again what we want here is
16:23 - the student to rewrite the step that
16:25 - they chose in part a so they've selected
16:27 - a step they're not scored
16:29 - they explain why the robot would have a
16:32 - hard time with that step
16:34 - and then what we want to do is based on
16:36 - that we write the steps so it's
16:39 - easier for a robot to complete
16:41 - and this is also worth one point and
16:43 - what we want to see here
16:45 - is that the rewritten step is more
16:47 - precise in the language that's used in
16:49 - some way
16:50 - or less subjective
16:52 - than the steps selected for part a
16:55 - now we do recognize that there's a lot
16:57 - of variability one could see here
17:00 - the types of responses students give
17:02 - that could be
17:03 - considered precise or less objective
17:07 - excuse me
17:08 - so what we've tried to do
17:10 - is provide you with example responses
17:13 - that
17:14 - really show each score level very very
17:17 - clearly and help you distinguish between
17:20 - the different scoring levels so if you
17:21 - could go to the next slide
17:25 - um this will be really important in the
17:27 - rubrics
17:29 - we have a couple different parts of the
17:31 - rubrics if you've seen you know they're
17:33 - available for download and if you've
17:34 - seen them we have
17:36 - a quick scoring guide and then we have
17:38 - the detailed scoring guide
17:41 - and then within the detailed scoring
17:43 - guide we have sample responses and this
17:46 - is a sample response for two points
17:49 - where our students select to take out a
17:51 - t-shirt
17:52 - they explain that a robot would have
17:54 - difficulty completing the step because
17:56 - the instructions don't say the exact
17:57 - type of shirt
17:59 - you have many types of shirts
18:01 - in the closet they come in different
18:02 - color styles and sizes
18:04 - the student clearly gets the idea from
18:06 - this
18:08 - and for part b
18:10 - and they rewrite the step to be more
18:12 - precise take out the first t-shirt
18:15 - from the right hanger hanging
18:17 - from the right hanging on hanger
18:20 - the language throughout has never been
18:22 - quite
18:23 - precise but the idea is there that they
18:26 - they did
18:27 - um provide a more precise explanation
18:30 - and then we
18:31 - provide a rationale for why they get
18:33 - those points
18:35 - um and so i just want to point this out
18:36 - because i think this will be really
18:38 - valuable as teachers
18:40 - uh start to use the rubrics and learn
18:42 - what works and what doesn't
18:44 - um
18:45 - in terms of scoring needs
18:48 - and so if you go to the next slide i
18:50 - think that's it for me and happy to
18:53 - answer any questions or
18:55 - uh you know hear any comments folks have
18:57 - about the assessments or the rubrics
19:00 - so eric we did have two questions come
19:02 - up in the chat pod
19:04 - the first one um folks were having
19:06 - trouble accessing the link to the
19:07 - assessments on the cs10k site
19:10 - that they should be in contact with
19:12 - cs10k about or are you able to give us a
19:14 - different link
19:16 - um no you know i i
19:19 - i would probably go ahead and contact us
19:21 - and so again i just want to emphasize
19:23 - that if they are
19:26 - logged in like they have an account on
19:28 - cs10k and that account has been
19:30 - validated
19:32 - um
19:32 - i believe the ecs open group is open i
19:36 - don't think they have to request
19:38 - membership do they i'm not i don't
19:40 - believe they do
19:42 - yeah
19:43 - yeah but that's a validated account
19:46 - yeah and then and then it's under the
19:48 - resources however
19:50 - um
19:51 - if folks are having you know if if
19:54 - they've signed up for an account
19:55 - recently like in the next last couple
19:57 - days
19:58 - it may be that their account may not be
19:59 - validated but
20:01 - if they've been using it for a while and
20:03 - they just don't see that resource yet
20:05 - then that's another issue
20:06 - yeah and we'd love to hear from them
20:08 - individually
20:10 - and we can go ahead and help them get to
20:12 - those assessments
20:13 - okay
20:14 - what link do you have just uh just to be
20:16 - visited
20:18 - you had in your slide it was resource
20:19 - slash ecs assessments yes and that that
20:23 - is the the link we've been distributing
20:25 - to folks and
20:26 - what that again the hang up we've been
20:28 - experiencing is that folks
20:30 - may not have their account or account
20:33 - validated yet right um
20:36 - and they can't see the resources until
20:38 - they do
20:39 - yeah and it does seem like a couple
20:40 - folks in the chat pod said they did not
20:42 - have an issue so it might just be
20:44 - something with the individual's account
20:46 - but if you are having any trouble
20:48 - accessing the assessments or the ecs
20:50 - open group um it would definitely be a
20:52 - good idea to shoot an email over to
20:53 - eric's group packed underscore ecs
20:57 - great
20:58 - um
21:00 - oh sure did someone else want to chime
21:02 - in go right ahead i saw someone start to
21:04 - speak
21:08 - so we had one more question
21:10 - i'm not sure whether you can answer this
21:11 - one but one of our members was wondering
21:14 - whether you had any additional um
21:16 - suggestions for daily warm-up activities
21:19 - or exit tickets that would help with
21:21 - this um
21:22 - assessment work
21:23 - you know that's a really interesting
21:25 - question and um i at this point no but
21:29 - one of the things we want to engage ecs
21:32 - teachers in this year through the
21:34 - community of practice website
21:37 - is
21:39 - i
21:40 - for lack of a better term leaning on the
21:42 - ecs teachers expertise and experiences
21:44 - in the classroom and the community
21:48 - um
21:49 - to develop some
21:51 - more formative type tasks that are
21:54 - connected in with these end of unit
21:57 - tasks because what we really want
21:59 - to do ultimately is have this idea of a
22:01 - through course assessment where
22:03 - we have things like exit you know exit
22:06 - slips or the mastery slips or
22:08 - there's different versions of these
22:10 - things but they're all formative in
22:11 - nature to be able to
22:13 - help students and teachers work together
22:16 - along the way before they get to that
22:18 - end of the unit class that end of unit
22:20 - assessment
22:21 - and so we don't have those right now but
22:23 - we are
22:25 - we're working on plans right now to
22:27 - engage the community in
22:29 - helping us develop some of those things
22:32 - and really leaning on the the expertise
22:34 - and experience of the teachers
22:36 - and we have these we have these larger
22:37 - scenario-based tasks but
22:39 - underlying those are design templates
22:42 - that we developed first
22:43 - and from those we can work with teachers
22:46 - to
22:47 - parse out the you know the different
22:49 - things that we're targeting these bigger
22:51 - tasks
22:52 - into things that would be more
22:53 - appropriate for
22:55 - you know
22:56 - smaller exit type mastery
22:59 - flips or whatnot and another thing i
23:01 - want to add is that
23:02 - this year we're we have ongoing studies
23:04 - where we are
23:06 - we're in the process of piloting some
23:08 - new tasks
23:10 - and both the type you see in the current
23:13 - assessments and
23:14 - on multiple choice tasks because one of
23:16 - the things we want to be able to do
23:19 - is provide teachers with support on
23:21 - conceptual knowledge of their students
23:23 - because the tasks we have right now
23:26 - assume that the student has the
23:28 - conceptual knowledge and we're looking
23:30 - for them to apply it
23:32 - in many cases it may not be that the
23:34 - student has a good grasp on that
23:36 - underlying conceptual knowledge
23:38 - and
23:39 - multiple choice
23:40 - conceptual knowledge type tasks
23:43 - can help get at that and so from those
23:46 - we can build
23:48 - out formative measures as well so
23:49 - there's a lot of different opportunities
23:51 - here
23:52 - to get at some finer grained measurement
23:54 - of
23:56 - of conceptual knowledge and more
23:57 - formative measures from that as well
24:01 - great thank you eric um so we have just
24:03 - a quick update um brooke tells us if
24:05 - you're having issues with accessing the
24:07 - assessments make sure you're logged into
24:08 - cs10k and that you're a member of the
24:11 - ecs open group and folks if you're still
24:13 - having trouble after that please
24:15 - definitely do send an email to eric
24:17 - um danny did you have any other
24:19 - follow-up questions for eric i'll hand
24:20 - it back to you
24:24 - um
24:25 - no so eric the you guys did a webinar of
24:30 - overviewing all of the unit assessments
24:32 - right up through four
24:34 - that's correct so if people want to find
24:37 - that is there a place they can go to get
24:41 - those will be
24:43 - yeah we'll have those posted on the
24:45 - cs10k site and on the pax site in the
24:48 - coming weeks
24:51 - awesome so if you want an overview of
24:54 - like eric did of one of the questions
24:56 - from
24:58 - each of unit 2 unit three and unit four
25:00 - you can take a look at those
25:02 - um in that video
25:04 - that will get posted
25:07 - and i'm just wanna reiterate i'm happy
25:08 - to come back and and talk with your
25:10 - teachers whenever
25:12 - you have time in your schedule as we
25:14 - uh move throughout the year if there's
25:16 - you know questions and other things that
25:17 - come up i
25:18 - we really do want to support the whole
25:20 - community of ecs teachers and
25:22 - particularly those
25:23 - uh working through code.org um it's such
25:26 - an important initiative so uh do let us
25:28 - know how we can help and if we can fit
25:30 - it in we will do so
25:32 - awesome well thank you very much for
25:35 - joining us well thank you for the
25:36 - comment
25:39 - and if you guys have any questions that
25:40 - pop up in your head
25:42 - we can always address them
25:44 - or send an email to eric
25:47 - later on so we're going to keep heading
25:50 - forward thank you again eric for all
25:52 - that
25:53 - information it was really helpful
25:57 - we're
25:58 - we're going to head into our phase 3
26:00 - online overview
26:02 - so
26:02 - as i mentioned at the beginning of the
26:05 - webinar
26:06 - we have released phase 3 online
26:09 - it's going to look a little different
26:11 - than
26:12 - your phase 2 online it's still in code
26:15 - studio and it still has a bunch of
26:17 - levels but we're actually going to break
26:20 - phrase 3 into units so you're going to
26:22 - see that this phase 3 online is only
26:24 - unit 2. we will be releasing unit 3 unit
26:27 - 4
26:29 - at the beginning of next month and then
26:32 - 5 and 6 will come out later in the year
26:35 - so
26:36 - what does phase 3 online look like and
26:38 - how is it different than phase 2 online
26:41 - so the major thing is that we're going
26:43 - to be doing a challenge
26:46 - and a challenge is just our fancy word
26:49 - for
26:50 - a um planning of a lesson and sharing it
26:54 - with the community so you're going to
26:55 - either work individually or with a
26:57 - partner
26:58 - to
27:00 - take a look at one particular lesson and
27:02 - prepare to teach it
27:04 - and then create some resources just to
27:06 - share with the teaching community so
27:08 - that you can share
27:11 - your lesson and someone else shares a
27:12 - different lesson we all get to learn
27:14 - from each other
27:16 - all right so why complete these
27:18 - challenges
27:20 - it's really important
27:21 - to complete them because it'll help you
27:24 - when you're heading into teaching right
27:26 - these are the lessons you're going to
27:28 - teach and we're just giving you an
27:29 - opportunity to teach
27:32 - that lesson ahead of time
27:34 - right try it out see what happens
27:37 - uh
27:38 - test the activity think about what extra
27:40 - resources you might want to add so by
27:43 - doing this you'll get just get a chance
27:45 - to prepare a lesson
27:47 - you'll receive feedback from other
27:50 - teachers in the community so we're gonna
27:52 - you'll be posting what you create to the
27:54 - forum and by posting it you get
27:57 - you'll hopefully get some feedback from
27:58 - other teachers you'll get feedback from
28:01 - us at code.org
28:04 - as to if your
28:06 - work meets the criteria we ask for and
28:09 - then you'll also hopefully
28:11 - learn from the other resources
28:13 - that will be posted as well um
28:18 - so how do you complete this challenge
28:20 - there's a couple steps and i've tried to
28:23 - shrink this slide down i know i hate
28:25 - slides with so much text but i really
28:28 - wanted to get in as much as possible
28:31 - while still shrinking it down so we're
28:33 - gonna go through it all right so what
28:35 - you're gonna be doing you're gonna
28:36 - prepare for a lesson this is step one
28:38 - and what you'll do is we'll give you a
28:40 - list of lessons that are ones that are
28:42 - usually really challenging for teachers
28:45 - and you'll pick one of those lessons
28:47 - you'll share that choice on the forum
28:49 - and that's also the place you can ask to
28:51 - see if you can find a friend that wants
28:53 - to work with you this friend does not
28:54 - need to be sitting in the same location
28:56 - as you these wonderful hangouts can be
28:59 - done
29:00 - one person to another on google hangouts
29:02 - and you can talk and chat or you can go
29:05 - over the phone if you like that better
29:06 - whatever works for you you can find a
29:08 - partner or work individually
29:11 - but you're still going to share your
29:12 - choice so people know
29:13 - who's working on what
29:15 - then you'll go through the lesson and
29:17 - try out the activities you don't need to
29:19 - try it out on your students you're just
29:21 - trying it out yourself or if you need
29:23 - like a friend to help you out maybe you
29:24 - like rope your spouse into it or some of
29:27 - your friends over for a party one night
29:29 - and you decide that you're gonna make
29:30 - them do ecs
29:31 - whatever you need to do to
29:34 - test out the lesson
29:35 - and then you're gonna create samples of
29:37 - the types of work that students will
29:39 - create just so that
29:41 - when you share it other teachers can see
29:43 - all right so this is what
29:45 - someone's results of this work should
29:47 - look like
29:49 - you'll reflect on the experience we have
29:50 - a reflection sheet it's not you're not
29:52 - going to hand it in it's just more for
29:54 - you to think back what did i go through
29:56 - what do i need to prepare what else
29:58 - could i add to this
30:00 - and then you'll create a plan from that
30:03 - your plan
30:04 - will just overview those reflections
30:06 - what did you think what did you need to
30:08 - add
30:09 - you'll create resources or find
30:11 - resources
30:13 - to add to the lesson
30:15 - if you think that's necessary
30:17 - you can create a video so we have some
30:19 - awesome
30:21 - examples from the csp curriculum
30:24 - of teaching tips videos that you can try
30:26 - out
30:28 - you can just create a video
30:30 - that
30:31 - you sit in front of your computer
30:33 - explaining what
30:34 - you found from what going through the
30:36 - lesson and what you'd suggest other
30:38 - teachers or you can create a video that
30:40 - overviews how to do something so when we
30:42 - get into a programming unit you could
30:44 - overview how to do a certain programming
30:47 - concept
30:48 - any of that stuff is fine any resources
30:51 - you might add even if it's a slide deck
30:53 - that would be awesome too
30:55 - so you'll create that and then you'll
30:56 - make a one-page
30:58 - summary of this so we have an overview
31:01 - template this is kind of like a cover
31:03 - sheet that you would hand in it
31:04 - overviews everything that you have
31:08 - learned from this you'll put links to
31:09 - your resources
31:11 - and this will be your way to easily
31:13 - share with each other what you've
31:14 - learned about your lesson
31:18 - and then there's a rubric just for you
31:19 - to self-assess it's the same rubric that
31:21 - we'll be using
31:22 - to check for
31:24 - completion of the challenge
31:26 - so you can just go through that and
31:27 - check that yourself so you know when you
31:29 - hand it in you're good to go
31:31 - and then lastly at the end you're going
31:32 - to share it so you're going to share
31:34 - your work to the forum
31:36 - and more detailed uh
31:38 - overview of how to do this is given on
31:41 - your online pd so don't worry about it
31:44 - this is there are lots of
31:46 - little breakdowns of these steps in that
31:48 - so you will know more details
31:51 - then um you'll find the thread that
31:53 - matches the lesson you worked on and
31:55 - you'll p
31:56 - post
31:57 - your work there because that way when
31:59 - you are going through the forum and
32:01 - you're trying to find out how do i teach
32:02 - this lesson you just go straight to that
32:05 - lesson and you'll be able to
32:07 - see oh look there's all this work that
32:09 - other teachers did and i can
32:11 - learn from their experiences and then
32:13 - lastly in order to get credit for it and
32:16 - to get it
32:18 - submitted to us you'll have to post a
32:20 - link to your forum post
32:22 - in your online pd but don't worry
32:25 - you'll be have directions to do that and
32:27 - it won't be too difficult so don't worry
32:30 - too much
32:32 - all right so how do you submit all this
32:36 - um and when do you need to submit it so
32:38 - you'll submit it onto the forum
32:40 - and then you'll copy and paste the link
32:42 - you need to do this
32:44 - by
32:45 - um your phase four which is this summer
32:48 - so you got lots of time we're really not
32:50 - looking for you to sit down and go
32:52 - through level by level and
32:54 - check the green marks
32:56 - um along the way we're looking for you
32:58 - to
33:00 - be able to prep as it fits your schedule
33:02 - so if you're going to do
33:04 - unit 4 before unit 3 for some reason
33:07 - maybe you're running a semester class
33:09 - and you do units one two and four
33:12 - do the unit four pd before unit three pd
33:15 - that makes more sense for you
33:18 - that is why unit three and unit four are
33:19 - getting released together at the same
33:21 - time they'll get released november
33:23 - beginning of november so
33:26 - if that's what you need do that you can
33:28 - always come back and do the other ones
33:30 - later in the year but do the ones you
33:33 - need to prep for the work that you're
33:35 - going to be doing in your classroom we
33:37 - really want this to help improve your
33:39 - classroom experience so we have
33:41 - suggested completion dates oh i'm
33:44 - clicking too fast obviously
33:47 - we have suggested completion dates but
33:49 - those are just recommend recommendations
33:52 - you just need to have it done by the end
33:54 - of the school year all of them done by
33:56 - the end of the school year
33:59 - all right
34:00 - um
34:02 - i'm now going to stop talking and see if
34:06 - there are any questions about the phase
34:08 - three online
34:11 - so danny we did have one question in the
34:12 - chat pod which i answered but i thought
34:14 - it might be good to talk about it on the
34:16 - video so it's in the recording um
34:18 - someone asked if this um challenge
34:20 - assignment and online pd is just for
34:22 - teachers who are part of our district
34:24 - partnership ecs program
34:26 - um and the answer i gave so correct me
34:28 - if i'm wrong um is that anyone can go to
34:31 - forum.co.org
34:33 - c slash ecs and see the challenges and
34:36 - submit but it's not required
34:38 - unless you're part of the program is
34:40 - that correct
34:41 - yeah we'd love to have teachers that are
34:43 - outside of the program
34:45 - do the work and share their resources so
34:47 - this is another great time to talk about
34:50 - the resource folder
34:51 - one of the best things about being part
34:54 - of a cohort of teachers is that you get
34:56 - to
34:57 - work with each other and hopefully learn
34:59 - from each other we've seen a lot of this
35:02 - with the forum already with people
35:04 - posting like hey here's a kahoot that i
35:06 - made for
35:07 - um
35:09 - my class maybe some other teachers will
35:11 - like it and we actually had a teacher
35:12 - that posted back and said they used it
35:14 - and they loved it it worked great for
35:16 - their kids so if you have a resource
35:18 - that you created
35:20 - maybe you have a slide deck we have
35:21 - another teacher that shared all of her
35:22 - slide decks she created
35:24 - so if you have those resources we want
35:27 - to see those and we want you to share
35:28 - them um because it it is helpful and it
35:32 - does make your lives easier because
35:35 - maybe two of you are creating slide
35:36 - decks and you can share the
35:39 - responsibility and only create it every
35:40 - other day if you want to work with
35:42 - another teacher so these
35:44 - groups of teachers help
35:46 - make everybody better
35:48 - so if you're outside of the coho
35:50 - cohort you're not an official code.org
35:53 - teacher but you want to add to the
35:54 - resources go for it
35:57 - and use and take from what the code.org
35:59 - teachers create i think that's one of
36:00 - the benefits of doing this and also just
36:03 - to clarify between um uh eric was
36:05 - speaking about the cs 10k community for
36:07 - ecs that's a great place to go to
36:09 - interact with ecs teachers from all
36:12 - across the country
36:13 - the code.org forums forum.co.org that's
36:16 - where we have our specific program
36:18 - related conversations but are also a
36:20 - great resource so feel free to use both
36:23 - communities or whatever works best for
36:24 - you and if you do have something awesome
36:27 - i would suggest sharing it in both
36:28 - places so that not only code.org
36:30 - teachers can benefit but all ecs
36:32 - teachers
36:33 - um so danny there's one other question
36:35 - david asks should should we be able to
36:37 - see phase three online in codestudio
36:39 - today
36:42 - i can actually take that this is brooke
36:46 - i am sitting across from the person who
36:48 - is releasing it even as we speak um so
36:52 - that should be available in your teacher
36:53 - dashboard
36:55 - in minutes basically and you'll you'll
36:58 - get an email when that happens as well
36:59 - but it will be available today
37:05 - and just to reiterate what danny said

37:11 - available to you later today and
37:13 - there'll be a unit 2 challenge so as
37:15 - you're working through the online pd
37:17 - there will be a couple of stages that
37:20 - are just sort of an introduction and
37:21 - tell you about the pd and the challenge
37:23 - and then there'll be some stages that
37:25 - you can work through on your own about
37:26 - the different lessons and it finishes up
37:28 - with the challenge and you'll have the
37:30 - same exact workflow for unit 3 4 5 and
37:32 - 6.
37:36 - so if there are any other questions now
37:38 - about ecs or the code.org program please
37:40 - feel free to put them in the chat pod
37:41 - and we'll take them before we close out
37:43 - tonight
37:59 - okay ladies well it looks like we don't

38:27 - important announcements about the
38:28 - programs and um and just to reiterate
38:30 - this this call is a great resource for
38:32 - folks who are in the current cohort of
38:34 - code.org ucs teachers but like luanne um
38:37 - it's open to alumni and veterans as well
38:40 - and any interested parties
38:42 - um so the next call is going to be
38:43 - november 3rd same time and we'll

Cleaned transcript:

and pull up welcome everyone to your ecs monthly meeting for october we're really glad that you've been able to join us this evening for the next 45 minutes to an hour we're going to be working together to chat about the exploring computer science curriculum and the code.org program my name is melissa jones i'm a community manager here at code.org and this evening i'm joined by danny mcavoy who's our ecs program manager brooke osborne high school program manager and our special guest eric snow who's a researcher from sri international our goals with these calls as always are to connect as a community and to discuss how the school year is going with your ecs implementation tonight we're really excited to get a tour of the new unit assessment from eric and to get an overview of the phase 3pd from danny and of course at the end of the call there'll be plenty of time for you to share questions concerns and feedback for the group this month we're using blue jeans for our platform um so last month if you joined us we used google hangouts it's slightly different blue jeans is fun and pretty easy to use there's a chat window that's located sort of right above your picture if you or have your video on um and if you click on that you can type in any questions you have for the speaker feedback ideas say hello and introduce yourself it's an easy way to communicate with the moderators and then also you should have a little microphone and a little um video camera icon underneath your picture and you can toggle those on and off if you'd like to speak or share your video stream with others next i'm going to go ahead and introduce danny mcavoy who's going to share some important reminders for them all ready hi everybody uh so can you flip to the next slide where our important reminders are great thank you melissa um so for this month we have a couple important reminders first of all i'm sure many of you have heard that the sri unit assessment for unit 1 is now available and the link is right there and for you to look at if you you can't click on the link in the slides but if you want to check that out we'll have a link to a forum post at the end where you can find all of our resources that we've used throughout this talk so you'll be able to check those out download them there's a scoring guide as well and eric will have a chance to talk about that in a little bit the unit 2 assessment will release november 1st so that'll be before our next time we join together on a monthly call so just as a heads up november 1st that will show up for you as well phase 3 online is now available you should have received an email um with the link and everything you need for phase online if you haven't received that link or if you're missing information about it you want to email pdfcode.org or you can set put something in the chat window and we'll try and help you out uh last thing is just reminders um as always we'd love for you to add resources to the resource folder uh if you weren't able to make it to our um talk for last month we went over what the resource folder is and how to use it so we can we'll post a link to that video as well in case you want to check it out and see what the resource folder is and lastly always the forum is a great place to ask questions get help talk to other teachers find resources there's been some really great stuff that's been posted lately and some really great sharing so we'd love to see you guys keep that up it's really great to have such an awesome community to work with granny before you introduce her i'm just going to go ahead and switch over if you want to share your screen that way i can manage the chat pod that sounds good all righty i'm going to stop sharing and dania can start i'm going to go on mute as well anybody else um who's dialing in you may want to go on mute just to reduce background noise and i see eric has joined us as well so eric we're really glad to have you we're going to start your presentation in just one second great happy to be here thank you all righty um all good everybody can see that okay all right so we're really lucky tonight to have eric with us he's going to talk about the sri assessments uh all the work they've been doing to create these wonderful tests to go along with the um ecs curriculum that you guys already have received we have heard a lot of feedback from teachers that they really want some way to do assessment that schools are really asking for that so it's great to have these resources coming out this year as you're teaching the curriculum and eric's going to overview the unit 1 just part of the unit 1 assessment for you and answer questions that you may have about the assessment so i'm going to pass it off to eric great um thank you so should i go ahead and ah you've answered my question slides are right there um can i should i just tell you next screen when i'm ready yep okay great um so thank you very much for and you can all see me is that correct yep okay great uh a little informal tonight i hope that's uh okay i just ended my day um happy to be here really excited to talk to you about the assessments uh you've been waiting quite a long time for them uh for those of you who have been doing ecs for more than one year and those of you who are starting this year it's a good year to start because we are happy to have released kind of the first validated version of the assessments uh for use by teachers and i emphasized that last part because that's really who we created the assessments for we know that there are a lot of other uses and folks that want to use the assessments for other things but um you know from the outset i want to emphasize that we want we did this project to support the teachers using the curriculum and to support the spread of the curriculum and so we're really excited to have this opportunity to talk with code.org teachers who are implementing ecs if you want to go to the next one and just to tell you a little bit about myself as well as as a way of introduction i work at the center for technology and learning at si international in the education division we focus on uh tech you know as the name of the center implies uh technology and education projects both in evaluation and assessment and in different curricular areas science computer science as one of our more recent areas of focus i do a lot of work in assessment development and particularly in assessment validation that's my specialization um i also do evaluation and i'm working on a number of different evaluations uh around computational thinking and game design right now that is nice because it's in the after school environment so that gives me a kind of a spread of uh stuff from both uh in school uh classroom types of environments to after school in the computer science space but as uh as mentioned we have been working on the ecs assessments for about two years now they've gone through two rounds of piloting um primarily in chicago schools but also in other in a few other schools throughout the country as well and we've gone through two rounds of validation for various reasons because really the first time out this was brand new we were dealing with a brand new area of measurement so we really wanted to kind of figure out how to do this right and then the second time around was really about refining the assessment tasks and making sure that we felt comfortable uh with you know releasing them this year because we really knew there was a need to do so so we have we we we are releasing the assessments through the cs10k community of practice website uh most of you i think already know about this website um and it's released as a resource in the ecs open group which means that you have to have a cs10k account and be logged into the website in order to see the available resources one of which is the assessments um excuse me are the assessments and the links are are shown there on the slide um we have a particular schedule for really uh that we're kind of trying to release them on that follows the recommended kind of sequencing and timing of the curriculum if you could proceed to the next slide that'd be great thank you um we've already released unit one um october first and then we're doing pretty much a monthly uh release with some time extra time around the holidays um we do understand that folks are there's different flavors of ecs if you will and we know that some folks are going to be implementing on different schedules and so if that's the case if you are after these dates the assessments are going to remain open for download so that's not a problem but if it's before these dates and you have a special request please go ahead and contact us at that email address and we'll be happy to accommodate you and talk with you about your implementation schedule and how we can make sure you have the assessments you need if you want to proceed to the next slide um so i really wanted to i could say a lot more about her development process and so on and so forth and was going to until uh melissa and danny and others um kindly prompted me to focus in on one of the tasks and some of the scoring for unit one which i think will probably be more relevant to all of you at this point um so before i do that i actually wanted to take a minute to stop and see if there are any questions before i kind of dive into this example if anybody has any questions or has anything they would like to discuss i have no questions so far in the chat pod but if there is anybody that would like to turn their mic on and ask a question or put a question in the chat pod we can make sure it gets answered okay great well i i you know you never know quite how long to wait um i don't i know you have some other uh items on your agenda so i don't want to delay anyone uh this evening um but i did want to dive into an example of a unit one task and particularly focus on the scoring aspects because i think that that is going to be probably one of the more challenging aspects of this for it from the teacher perspective right out the gate and we want to be able to provide what support we can i will say that beyond this presentation to you which is preliminary nature we will be running a series of webinars um come winter and spring around um both scoring and i think more significantly around score interpretation and test use because we really do want to provide support and those will be run through the cs10k community of practice website and particularly maybe i'll be able to come back and talk to you all if uh if things work out well and and uh it fits your schedule so for unit one um task two we have entitled what is computing and what we're really taught and what i want to do here is i want to walk through kind of what we're trying to target with this task and then show you what the task looks like which i think many of you have already seen and then tell you kind of what our rationale is for how we score it um so in terms of the core concepts and learning goals which is in the left most column there um you see that we're trying to target you know the concepts of computers and computing computing versus noncomputing tasks and this idea of computer or tele intelligence as it's represented in ecs um and i think in particular we're looking for students to be able to explain the differences between tasks that can and cannot be accomplished with computer um in order to kind of take this down to the assessment level what we're really targeting is a student's ability to explain not significant because we're really targeting their ability to engage in explanation and explain the differences between tasks that can and cannot be accomplished with the computer and um you know so we have this task what is computing students are provided with the scenario and asked to relate it to the types of tasks a robot which in this case represents a computer there are other representations certainly of what a robot can do so if you want to proceed to the next slide so this comes from the actual assessment task in unit one um again it's task two and in this task it's um carla has programmed the robot to select some clothes um and then your the students told what the robot is able to do move around the room open and close doors and pick up and drop objects very simple behaviors um then they were provided with a set of instructions for the robot once the robot is inside the closet to select the clothes there's three sets of instructions they're worded in particular ways and then if you want to go to the next slide in this slide we start to see you know the students engaging with the task after the context of the scenario is laid out their first step is for them to select or identify one step in the three steps that we provided in the task setup that the robot would have difficulty completing we provide those tasks again those those steps again and they're supposed to select one we're not scoring the selection that's not the objective of the task what we really care about is the student's ability to engage in explanation providing rationale for their selection and so first we want to know in part a why the robot would have difficulty completing that task and so this explanation is worth one point student either kind of gets it or doesn't and this is based on a couple iterations of seeing how students respond to this task um keep that in mind this isn't just our best guess this actually comes from um several hundred responses to this and seeing that these are the kinds of things that students do and before we had several points for this explanation and now we really broke it down to just one and really what we want to see is that they should discuss difficulties a robot would have with the steps selected because it would it would eat the step is either not precise for example take out a tshirt isn't very precise it's very vague um or it's too subjective which take out a hat from the top shelf that matches the outfit might be too subjective so in that case you could get a point for an explanation that went along one of those two lines there might be some other explanations that would make sense as well and that's one of the things is as this assessment evolves and we get more and more responses we'll be the rubric is going to evolve as well so the more types of responses that we see to this the more we're going to be able to refine um this but this is consistent this this way of evaluating the explanation is consistent with both what we're seeing in the the pilots and also in the curriculum if you want to go to the next slide so for part b again what we want here is the student to rewrite the step that they chose in part a so they've selected a step they're not scored they explain why the robot would have a hard time with that step and then what we want to do is based on that we write the steps so it's easier for a robot to complete and this is also worth one point and what we want to see here is that the rewritten step is more precise in the language that's used in some way or less subjective than the steps selected for part a now we do recognize that there's a lot of variability one could see here the types of responses students give that could be considered precise or less objective excuse me so what we've tried to do is provide you with example responses that really show each score level very very clearly and help you distinguish between the different scoring levels so if you could go to the next slide um this will be really important in the rubrics we have a couple different parts of the rubrics if you've seen you know they're available for download and if you've seen them we have a quick scoring guide and then we have the detailed scoring guide and then within the detailed scoring guide we have sample responses and this is a sample response for two points where our students select to take out a tshirt they explain that a robot would have difficulty completing the step because the instructions don't say the exact type of shirt you have many types of shirts in the closet they come in different color styles and sizes the student clearly gets the idea from this and for part b and they rewrite the step to be more precise take out the first tshirt from the right hanger hanging from the right hanging on hanger the language throughout has never been quite precise but the idea is there that they they did um provide a more precise explanation and then we provide a rationale for why they get those points um and so i just want to point this out because i think this will be really valuable as teachers uh start to use the rubrics and learn what works and what doesn't um in terms of scoring needs and so if you go to the next slide i think that's it for me and happy to answer any questions or uh you know hear any comments folks have about the assessments or the rubrics so eric we did have two questions come up in the chat pod the first one um folks were having trouble accessing the link to the assessments on the cs10k site that they should be in contact with cs10k about or are you able to give us a different link um no you know i i i would probably go ahead and contact us and so again i just want to emphasize that if they are logged in like they have an account on cs10k and that account has been validated um i believe the ecs open group is open i don't think they have to request membership do they i'm not i don't believe they do yeah yeah but that's a validated account yeah and then and then it's under the resources however um if folks are having you know if if they've signed up for an account recently like in the next last couple days it may be that their account may not be validated but if they've been using it for a while and they just don't see that resource yet then that's another issue yeah and we'd love to hear from them individually and we can go ahead and help them get to those assessments okay what link do you have just uh just to be visited you had in your slide it was resource slash ecs assessments yes and that that is the the link we've been distributing to folks and what that again the hang up we've been experiencing is that folks may not have their account or account validated yet right um and they can't see the resources until they do yeah and it does seem like a couple folks in the chat pod said they did not have an issue so it might just be something with the individual's account but if you are having any trouble accessing the assessments or the ecs open group um it would definitely be a good idea to shoot an email over to eric's group packed underscore ecs great um oh sure did someone else want to chime in go right ahead i saw someone start to speak so we had one more question i'm not sure whether you can answer this one but one of our members was wondering whether you had any additional um suggestions for daily warmup activities or exit tickets that would help with this um assessment work you know that's a really interesting question and um i at this point no but one of the things we want to engage ecs teachers in this year through the community of practice website is i for lack of a better term leaning on the ecs teachers expertise and experiences in the classroom and the community um to develop some more formative type tasks that are connected in with these end of unit tasks because what we really want to do ultimately is have this idea of a through course assessment where we have things like exit you know exit slips or the mastery slips or there's different versions of these things but they're all formative in nature to be able to help students and teachers work together along the way before they get to that end of the unit class that end of unit assessment and so we don't have those right now but we are we're working on plans right now to engage the community in helping us develop some of those things and really leaning on the the expertise and experience of the teachers and we have these we have these larger scenariobased tasks but underlying those are design templates that we developed first and from those we can work with teachers to parse out the you know the different things that we're targeting these bigger tasks into things that would be more appropriate for you know smaller exit type mastery flips or whatnot and another thing i want to add is that this year we're we have ongoing studies where we are we're in the process of piloting some new tasks and both the type you see in the current assessments and on multiple choice tasks because one of the things we want to be able to do is provide teachers with support on conceptual knowledge of their students because the tasks we have right now assume that the student has the conceptual knowledge and we're looking for them to apply it in many cases it may not be that the student has a good grasp on that underlying conceptual knowledge and multiple choice conceptual knowledge type tasks can help get at that and so from those we can build out formative measures as well so there's a lot of different opportunities here to get at some finer grained measurement of of conceptual knowledge and more formative measures from that as well great thank you eric um so we have just a quick update um brooke tells us if you're having issues with accessing the assessments make sure you're logged into cs10k and that you're a member of the ecs open group and folks if you're still having trouble after that please definitely do send an email to eric um danny did you have any other followup questions for eric i'll hand it back to you um no so eric the you guys did a webinar of overviewing all of the unit assessments right up through four that's correct so if people want to find that is there a place they can go to get those will be yeah we'll have those posted on the cs10k site and on the pax site in the coming weeks awesome so if you want an overview of like eric did of one of the questions from each of unit 2 unit three and unit four you can take a look at those um in that video that will get posted and i'm just wanna reiterate i'm happy to come back and and talk with your teachers whenever you have time in your schedule as we uh move throughout the year if there's you know questions and other things that come up i we really do want to support the whole community of ecs teachers and particularly those uh working through code.org um it's such an important initiative so uh do let us know how we can help and if we can fit it in we will do so awesome well thank you very much for joining us well thank you for the comment and if you guys have any questions that pop up in your head we can always address them or send an email to eric later on so we're going to keep heading forward thank you again eric for all that information it was really helpful we're we're going to head into our phase 3 online overview so as i mentioned at the beginning of the webinar we have released phase 3 online it's going to look a little different than your phase 2 online it's still in code studio and it still has a bunch of levels but we're actually going to break phrase 3 into units so you're going to see that this phase 3 online is only unit 2. we will be releasing unit 3 unit 4 at the beginning of next month and then 5 and 6 will come out later in the year so what does phase 3 online look like and how is it different than phase 2 online so the major thing is that we're going to be doing a challenge and a challenge is just our fancy word for a um planning of a lesson and sharing it with the community so you're going to either work individually or with a partner to take a look at one particular lesson and prepare to teach it and then create some resources just to share with the teaching community so that you can share your lesson and someone else shares a different lesson we all get to learn from each other all right so why complete these challenges it's really important to complete them because it'll help you when you're heading into teaching right these are the lessons you're going to teach and we're just giving you an opportunity to teach that lesson ahead of time right try it out see what happens uh test the activity think about what extra resources you might want to add so by doing this you'll get just get a chance to prepare a lesson you'll receive feedback from other teachers in the community so we're gonna you'll be posting what you create to the forum and by posting it you get you'll hopefully get some feedback from other teachers you'll get feedback from us at code.org as to if your work meets the criteria we ask for and then you'll also hopefully learn from the other resources that will be posted as well um so how do you complete this challenge there's a couple steps and i've tried to shrink this slide down i know i hate slides with so much text but i really wanted to get in as much as possible while still shrinking it down so we're gonna go through it all right so what you're gonna be doing you're gonna prepare for a lesson this is step one and what you'll do is we'll give you a list of lessons that are ones that are usually really challenging for teachers and you'll pick one of those lessons you'll share that choice on the forum and that's also the place you can ask to see if you can find a friend that wants to work with you this friend does not need to be sitting in the same location as you these wonderful hangouts can be done one person to another on google hangouts and you can talk and chat or you can go over the phone if you like that better whatever works for you you can find a partner or work individually but you're still going to share your choice so people know who's working on what then you'll go through the lesson and try out the activities you don't need to try it out on your students you're just trying it out yourself or if you need like a friend to help you out maybe you like rope your spouse into it or some of your friends over for a party one night and you decide that you're gonna make them do ecs whatever you need to do to test out the lesson and then you're gonna create samples of the types of work that students will create just so that when you share it other teachers can see all right so this is what someone's results of this work should look like you'll reflect on the experience we have a reflection sheet it's not you're not going to hand it in it's just more for you to think back what did i go through what do i need to prepare what else could i add to this and then you'll create a plan from that your plan will just overview those reflections what did you think what did you need to add you'll create resources or find resources to add to the lesson if you think that's necessary you can create a video so we have some awesome examples from the csp curriculum of teaching tips videos that you can try out you can just create a video that you sit in front of your computer explaining what you found from what going through the lesson and what you'd suggest other teachers or you can create a video that overviews how to do something so when we get into a programming unit you could overview how to do a certain programming concept any of that stuff is fine any resources you might add even if it's a slide deck that would be awesome too so you'll create that and then you'll make a onepage summary of this so we have an overview template this is kind of like a cover sheet that you would hand in it overviews everything that you have learned from this you'll put links to your resources and this will be your way to easily share with each other what you've learned about your lesson and then there's a rubric just for you to selfassess it's the same rubric that we'll be using to check for completion of the challenge so you can just go through that and check that yourself so you know when you hand it in you're good to go and then lastly at the end you're going to share it so you're going to share your work to the forum and more detailed uh overview of how to do this is given on your online pd so don't worry about it this is there are lots of little breakdowns of these steps in that so you will know more details then um you'll find the thread that matches the lesson you worked on and you'll p post your work there because that way when you are going through the forum and you're trying to find out how do i teach this lesson you just go straight to that lesson and you'll be able to see oh look there's all this work that other teachers did and i can learn from their experiences and then lastly in order to get credit for it and to get it submitted to us you'll have to post a link to your forum post in your online pd but don't worry you'll be have directions to do that and it won't be too difficult so don't worry too much all right so how do you submit all this um and when do you need to submit it so you'll submit it onto the forum and then you'll copy and paste the link you need to do this by um your phase four which is this summer so you got lots of time we're really not looking for you to sit down and go through level by level and check the green marks um along the way we're looking for you to be able to prep as it fits your schedule so if you're going to do unit 4 before unit 3 for some reason maybe you're running a semester class and you do units one two and four do the unit four pd before unit three pd that makes more sense for you that is why unit three and unit four are getting released together at the same time they'll get released november beginning of november so if that's what you need do that you can always come back and do the other ones later in the year but do the ones you need to prep for the work that you're going to be doing in your classroom we really want this to help improve your classroom experience so we have suggested completion dates oh i'm clicking too fast obviously we have suggested completion dates but those are just recommend recommendations you just need to have it done by the end of the school year all of them done by the end of the school year all right um i'm now going to stop talking and see if there are any questions about the phase three online so danny we did have one question in the chat pod which i answered but i thought it might be good to talk about it on the video so it's in the recording um someone asked if this um challenge assignment and online pd is just for teachers who are part of our district partnership ecs program um and the answer i gave so correct me if i'm wrong um is that anyone can go to forum.co.org c slash ecs and see the challenges and submit but it's not required unless you're part of the program is that correct yeah we'd love to have teachers that are outside of the program do the work and share their resources so this is another great time to talk about the resource folder one of the best things about being part of a cohort of teachers is that you get to work with each other and hopefully learn from each other we've seen a lot of this with the forum already with people posting like hey here's a kahoot that i made for um my class maybe some other teachers will like it and we actually had a teacher that posted back and said they used it and they loved it it worked great for their kids so if you have a resource that you created maybe you have a slide deck we have another teacher that shared all of her slide decks she created so if you have those resources we want to see those and we want you to share them um because it it is helpful and it does make your lives easier because maybe two of you are creating slide decks and you can share the responsibility and only create it every other day if you want to work with another teacher so these groups of teachers help make everybody better so if you're outside of the coho cohort you're not an official code.org teacher but you want to add to the resources go for it and use and take from what the code.org teachers create i think that's one of the benefits of doing this and also just to clarify between um uh eric was speaking about the cs 10k community for ecs that's a great place to go to interact with ecs teachers from all across the country the code.org forums forum.co.org that's where we have our specific program related conversations but are also a great resource so feel free to use both communities or whatever works best for you and if you do have something awesome i would suggest sharing it in both places so that not only code.org teachers can benefit but all ecs teachers um so danny there's one other question david asks should should we be able to see phase three online in codestudio today i can actually take that this is brooke i am sitting across from the person who is releasing it even as we speak um so that should be available in your teacher dashboard in minutes basically and you'll you'll get an email when that happens as well but it will be available today and just to reiterate what danny said there's going to be three parts um well more actually but the unit two part is what's going to be available to you later today and there'll be a unit 2 challenge so as you're working through the online pd there will be a couple of stages that are just sort of an introduction and tell you about the pd and the challenge and then there'll be some stages that you can work through on your own about the different lessons and it finishes up with the challenge and you'll have the same exact workflow for unit 3 4 5 and 6. so if there are any other questions now about ecs or the code.org program please feel free to put them in the chat pod and we'll take them before we close out tonight okay ladies well it looks like we don't have any other questions at this time danny did you have any parting words would you like me to close out uh well i think you want to talk about the meeting for next month and that we'll continue to do these yeah sure to make sure everyone is aware that we will be having these ecs meetings once a month um we'll be hoping to have guest speakers and reminders um just like we had um today as well as important announcements about the programs and um and just to reiterate this this call is a great resource for folks who are in the current cohort of code.org ucs teachers but like luanne um it's open to alumni and veterans as well and any interested parties um so the next call is going to be november 3rd same time and we'll probably use the same blue jeans place for it and then it's going to go the last slide there danny just a reminder that we would love to hear your feedback tonight so if you go to this forum thread you can tell us what you thought of tonight's meeting and that's also where we'll put a link to the slide deck and the recording once it's processed so thanks so much for being a participant tonight and we look forward to seeing you in november take care
