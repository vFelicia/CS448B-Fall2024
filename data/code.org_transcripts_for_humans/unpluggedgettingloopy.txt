00:06 - hi my name is miral cobb
00:09 - i'm the creator of illuminate
00:12 - in my work there is something i use in
00:14 - both dance moves and in programming
00:16 - light suits and that is
00:18 - loops
00:20 - loops are repeating an action over and
00:22 - over when you repeat something multiple
00:24 - times like my actions to keep the hula
00:27 - hoop spinning
00:28 - i'm performing a loop of that action
00:31 - this is a loop
00:33 - this is a loop
00:35 - and this is a loop
00:41 - today we're going to have a dance party
00:44 - we'll act out loops with a new dance the
00:46 - iteration we're going to learn about
00:49 - loops using a dance
00:51 - you will learn a couple of easy steps
00:53 - and then repeat them over and over to
00:55 - complete the dance
00:56 - here are the steps we need to learn
00:59 - clap your hands
01:01 - put your hands behind your head
01:04 - put your hands on your waist
01:06 - lift your left hand up lift your right
01:08 - hand up
01:11 - pretty simple right
01:12 - head waist head waist crack crack clap
01:16 - do you see how some steps are repeated
01:18 - such as clap crap
01:21 - that's a loop we need to do it two more
01:23 - ready
01:24 - clap you will discover that you can
01:26 - shorten the directions by putting some
01:28 - dance steps in loops
01:30 - are you ready
01:32 - now we're going to do a belly laugh
01:33 - ready
01:38 - we actually do use loops in our dancing
01:40 - the dancers are wearing computers and
01:42 - they're all on the same network and so i
01:44 - might loop the lights through the same
01:46 - dancers over and over again so in the
01:48 - loop i might have an iteration i'll say
01:50 - you want to go
01:51 - loop through these six dancers over and
01:53 - over again and then within the loop you
01:55 - want to increase the speed so that
01:56 - you're you're both looping through the
01:58 - same dancers but you're also increasing
01:59 - the speed of the light so that it kind
02:00 - of plays a visual trick on the audience
02:03 - and that's all created through loops
02:06 - loops are important in computer science
02:08 - because they make our work shorter and
02:10 - easier
