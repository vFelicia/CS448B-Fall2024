00:10 - welcome to scratch junior coding this is
00:13 - a series of videos to help you learn to
00:15 - code using scratch junior
00:18 - on scratch junior you can create your
00:20 - own stories riddles games and whatever
00:23 - else you want to create
00:25 - you're in control of everything and the
00:27 - programs that you write
00:29 - you will need the scratch junior app on
00:31 - your ipad android tablet or computer
00:35 - scratch junior is a free download and
00:38 - you'll have to get it so that you can do
00:40 - coding with us today you're going to
00:42 - create something like this
00:44 - we're going to have just a few seconds
00:46 - to memorize everything that's behind
00:48 - these cards you ready
00:50 - i'm going to hit the green flag
00:53 - we have a rabbit a fish a pig
00:56 - a dog
00:59 - did you memorize it that fast
01:02 - so we're creating a memory game
01:04 - i remember there was a rabbit here
01:08 - where was the starfish
01:11 - i think the starfish was here that's the
01:13 - dog
01:15 - so i got one point for the rabbit i
01:17 - didn't get the dog
01:20 - is the starfish on this one
01:23 - okay
01:25 - and i think the pig was right here
01:29 - and the frog was right here
01:32 - and the fish was right here
01:34 - so i got five points out of six
01:37 - so are you ready to make a memory game
01:40 - if we look at our characters let's see
01:42 - what coding it has for the characters
01:44 - there's not any how about for the pig
01:48 - the dog the frog
01:50 - there's no coding for the characters
01:52 - there is coding for each of these cards
01:56 - when you click on the card it goes away
01:58 - so here's all my different cards
02:01 - let's look at the code
02:03 - for one of these cards
02:08 - so when you touch it
02:10 - this symbol this block makes it go
02:12 - invisible
02:13 - so when it's touched it goes invisible
02:15 - let's look at another one i'm going to
02:17 - click on it
02:19 - and it goes
02:20 - invisible another thing that the car
02:23 - does is whenever you click on the flag
02:26 - it just wiggles a little bit it moves to
02:28 - the left it moves to the right wiggles a
02:31 - little bit and then it disappears
02:33 - it gives you 20
02:35 - time
02:36 - it's not 20 seconds it's just 20 units
02:39 - of time
02:40 - and then it shows up
02:43 - so let's see what that looks like it
02:45 - wiggles it's giving us a little bit of
02:47 - time to look at it
02:48 - then it come goes back visible and then
02:53 - that's the end
02:54 - let's look at that again so it's gonna
02:56 - when i click the green flag
02:59 - it's gonna wiggle a little bit
03:01 - get invisible for a little bit of time
03:04 - for us to learn it
03:05 - and then it shows back up and hides it
03:08 - from us
03:09 - and it stops and it doesn't do anything
03:11 - else until we click on it
03:13 - and then it goes invisible again
03:17 - so we have this little bit of time to
03:19 - memorize it and then it shows back up so
03:22 - that's the game we're going to create
03:24 - today click the plus to create a new
03:27 - project
03:28 - let's get rid of tick by holding down
03:31 - and clicking the x
03:33 - let's get some new characters
03:35 - we'll get the dog
03:44 - a pig
03:51 - and a frog
04:01 - let's make the pig a little smaller
04:11 - so he can hide behind the card
04:13 - we'll make the dog a little smaller so
04:15 - he can hide behind a card too
04:19 - you know from previous lessons whenever
04:22 - i click on the dog this is the coding
04:24 - area for the dog
04:26 - when i click on the pig this is his
04:28 - coding area
04:30 - and the frog we haven't done anything to
04:32 - him yet
04:33 - and we're done making him smaller so
04:35 - we'll get rid of that
04:37 - and we don't need to make the dog any
04:40 - smaller either
04:42 - let's just do three cards to memorize in
04:45 - our memory game today
04:48 - if we go into our characters do you see
04:51 - anything that could be used for a card
04:53 - to go over them we're going to have to
04:55 - go into the editor
04:56 - and draw something ourselves because we
04:58 - don't have anything here
05:00 - we're going to have to draw something
05:03 - so i'll click on the paint brush here to
05:05 - edit a photo
05:11 - i'm going to draw a square
05:18 - and get a little bit lighter green
05:21 - and fill my bucket up with that green
05:23 - and then dump my bucket in the square
05:32 - that's a good size it covers it up
05:36 - now i need three of these characters
05:39 - you could go in and draw it three times
05:42 - but a really easy way to copy that
05:44 - character is to hold down on it
05:49 - hold down on it and drag it into this
05:52 - scene
05:53 - and let it go now there's two of them
05:55 - if you hold down on it and you don't
05:57 - move it's going to think you want to
05:58 - delete it
05:59 - so don't do that
06:01 - just hold down on it and move really
06:03 - quick and let it go on your scene now i
06:06 - have three of them
06:08 - so i have three cards
06:10 - and we'll put the third card
06:12 - over the frog
06:14 - so i have three
06:15 - cards here
06:19 - we could rename them if we want to
06:39 - card one card two and card three
06:55 - so do you remember what we have to do
06:57 - for the card
06:59 - what kind of programming do we need to
07:01 - do for the card
07:04 - whenever you first start the game and
07:06 - you hit the green flag
07:07 - you want it to disappear
07:10 - for just a little while
07:14 - so when we hit the green flag
07:17 - the purple blocks
07:19 - makes it look different and so
07:20 - underneath the purple block is something
07:23 - to make it disappear
07:29 - and after that we're going to make it
07:30 - reappear
07:31 - which will make it cover up the animal
07:34 - again
07:35 - but we have to wait a little while
07:37 - give the players of your game
07:40 - just a little bit of time
07:42 - to
07:42 - memorize what's behind the cards
07:48 - so we'll give them about
07:50 - 20 on the clock
07:52 - and then it'll reappear
07:55 - and then it'll
07:57 - so when we hit this green flag let's see
07:59 - what happens
08:01 - so it disappeared for a count of 20 and
08:04 - then it showed back up so that works
08:05 - perfect
08:07 - now we could redo that
08:09 - for all three of our
08:10 - cards or we could just drag this code to
08:15 - card number two
08:17 - and drag this code to card number one
08:20 - i just let go
08:22 - and look it has the same code for card
08:25 - number one the same code for card number
08:28 - two
08:29 - so let's see what it looks like
08:32 - now we have time to memorize it and then
08:34 - they show back up
08:37 - but when i click on them
08:39 - it doesn't show me if i'm right
08:41 - so let's just say i'm playing this game
08:44 - i click on the flag and i try to
08:46 - memorize that it's a frog
08:49 - and then what else i don't remember
08:51 - okay but i do remember this is a frog so
08:53 - i'll click on it and see if i'm right
08:55 - click on it
08:57 - and nothing happened we're missing some
08:59 - code
09:02 - so for card number one
09:05 - we want it to do something when we click
09:07 - on it that is this yellow
09:10 - starting block
09:11 - what we want it to do is disappear again
09:15 - that's in our appearance blocks
09:18 - right here it disappears
09:20 - and that's the end that's all we need it
09:22 - to do
09:24 - so which one is card number one this one
09:30 - that one this is card number one because
09:32 - when i clicked on it it disappeared
09:35 - so we're gonna
09:36 - if you look at card number two and card
09:39 - number three it does not have this code
09:42 - in it
09:43 - let's just drag that to card number two
09:45 - and let go
09:46 - drag that to card number three and let
09:48 - go and all three of them have all that
09:52 - coding that we just did
09:55 - so we have just a few seconds to
09:58 - memorize it
09:59 - it was a frog
10:01 - and a
10:02 - pig and a dog
10:06 - i got three points
10:08 - if you want to have some pictures so
10:12 - that the players of your game know
10:13 - what's behind the cards because this
10:14 - happens so fast
10:17 - they have just a few seconds and then it
10:19 - disappears
10:20 - and they don't remember if there's even
10:22 - a starfish back there
10:24 - there's a fast way to make another copy
10:27 - of these characters so we could put them
10:28 - down here
10:30 - i'll just drag it
10:33 - without deleting it i'll just drag it
10:36 - to the scene
10:37 - drag a copy of the pig to the scene
10:41 - drag the frog to the scene
10:52 - i'll mix them up
10:59 - and then when your players play the game
11:02 - and they click on the green flag
11:04 - and they have just a minute to memorize
11:06 - it
11:07 - and then they know the characters are
11:09 - supposed to guess okay where was the fro
11:12 - where was the dog he's right here
11:15 - where was the pig he was right here
11:17 - makes it a little easier
11:19 - when you can see them
11:21 - now it's your turn create a new project
11:26 - add some characters to your project
11:29 - and then cover them up
11:31 - with some rectangles or squares any
11:33 - shape that you want
11:35 - and make a memory game out of it we've
11:37 - learned a couple of shortcuts today
11:39 - we've learned how to drag a character
11:42 - from one of your characters that you
11:44 - already have
11:45 - onto
11:47 - the scene to make a copy of it
11:49 - we've also learned
11:53 - how to copy code
11:55 - from one character to another character
11:59 - by just dragging it from this
12:00 - programming window onto the other
12:02 - character
12:04 - so you can make use of those shortcuts
12:08 - and make your own memory game
12:11 - today we also learned how to make
12:14 - characters disappear and reappear
12:17 - if you can make characters in your game
12:19 - disappear and reappear to make this
12:22 - memory game
12:23 - then congratulations you've mastered
12:26 - this lesson
12:28 - this free kids coding lesson was
12:30 - provided by stem and games subscribe
12:33 - watch more lessons and keep practicing
12:36 - and soon you will be creating new worlds
12:38 - and games and making your ideas come to
12:41 - life i'll see you next time
