00:01 - welcome to scratch coding this is a
00:04 - series of videos to help you learn to
00:06 - code using scratch
00:08 - with scratch you can create your own
00:11 - stories puzzles and games and whatever
00:14 - else you want to create you're in
00:16 - control of everything in the programs
00:19 - that you write
00:20 - create a free account at scratch.mit.edu
00:25 - so you can do coding with us today we're
00:27 - doing a simple version of pong it's like
00:30 - tennis or ping pong like and subscribe
00:33 - below because i have some power up ideas
00:35 - and some tricks that i want to share but
00:37 - today we're going to just keep it simple
00:40 - we have a new project
00:42 - first we have to make a backdrop
00:45 - we're going to paint one
00:52 - and i'm going to fill my background with
00:54 - blue
01:04 - and then i want just a little bit of a
01:06 - different blue
01:12 - on each side
01:19 - not real noticeable just a little
01:21 - different
01:27 - and then i want a white line down the
01:28 - middle to just show
01:30 - where the halfway point is
01:49 - and that's it for the background
01:53 - let's get rid of scratch and get a
01:55 - couple paddles for our game
02:03 - the paddle starts off turned 90 degrees
02:12 - and we want it to point zero
02:25 - how far left it is is minus 229
02:28 - that's x i want y to be zero so it'll be
02:30 - right in the middle
02:38 - if you don't like the green
02:40 - it's easy to just come in here and
02:42 - change to whatever you want
02:56 - besides going to this starting position
02:58 - really the only thing the paddle needs
02:59 - to do is go up and down
03:06 - the paddle on the right is going to use
03:08 - the up and down arrows the paddle on the
03:10 - left is going to use w and s w to go up
03:17 - so when w is pressed we want to go up
03:24 - it's not x
03:27 - change y by 10.
03:29 - we can copy that
03:34 - and when s is pressed we're going to
03:36 - change y by a negative 10 to make it go
03:39 - down
03:43 - works perfect
03:45 - that's all the code we're going to need
03:47 - so i'm going to
03:48 - duplicate that paddle
03:51 - the first one i want to call it left
03:52 - paddle
03:58 - and that one i want to call it right
03:59 - paddle
04:05 - and right paddle i want it to start off
04:07 - way over here
04:11 - so instead of going to x negative 229
04:14 - he'll be a positive 229 but he also
04:17 - needs to start in the middle at zero
04:20 - when the up arrow is pressed he'll go up
04:24 - and when the down arrow is pressed he'll
04:27 - go down and then two people can play
04:29 - against each other
04:33 - all we need now is a ball
04:41 - and of course you can go in here and
04:42 - change the color if you want
04:47 - we want to start all the code for the
04:49 - ball whenever the green flag is clicked
04:51 - and the first thing we want it to do
04:56 - is start moving
05:00 - forever
05:10 - and if it hits an edge
05:11 - to bounce off
05:18 - but instead of bouncing just straight
05:20 - back and forth
05:21 - we want to change this direction a
05:22 - little bit let's go with 95.
05:36 - also in the beginning we want it to just
05:38 - start right in the middle
05:50 - all right so it bounces off the walls
05:51 - just fine now now we need it to bounce
05:53 - off the paddles
06:02 - if it's touching
06:05 - the left paddle
06:17 - then go back to the right
06:25 - that's going to make it just go straight
06:26 - back
06:28 - it's going to be kind of boring
06:30 - you can play around with these numbers
06:36 - but what i like to do
06:42 - is take whatever direction it's going
06:44 - now and add something to it
06:48 - then it's not random but at least it's
06:50 - different every time it's not the same
06:52 - thing every time
07:02 - and then if it's touching
07:04 - the right paddle
07:09 - then it's a little different than the
07:11 - left paddle
07:17 - now we need to add if it's touching this
07:20 - blue line on the left it gives a point
07:23 - to the player on the right and if it's
07:25 - touching this blue line on the right
07:27 - it gives a point to the player on the
07:29 - left so we need a couple variables
07:36 - left score
07:41 - and right score
07:46 - this is his score
07:49 - and i can change it to a large readout
07:50 - to get rid of the word right score i
07:52 - don't need that
08:03 - and then we want to increase the score
08:05 - every time it touches that outside line
08:07 - that means we missed it with the paddle
08:23 - if it's touching this color over here
08:24 - i'm going to increase right score
08:31 - get some of that color
08:46 - and copy that would be the easiest thing
08:57 - and then if it's touching this blue over
08:58 - here
09:01 - we increase left score
09:04 - whenever we start the game we need to
09:06 - zero out these variables too so whenever
09:08 - the green flag is clicked
09:19 - we'll set both of them to zero
09:35 - it's looping through this so fast
09:38 - that it's touching the color a couple of
09:40 - times before the ball has a chance to
09:42 - turn around
09:44 - so it's adding more than one point
09:46 - whenever the ball hits the wall
09:51 - so if it's touching that color i could
09:53 - either
09:54 - wait for a certain amount of time or i
09:56 - could wait until it's not touching the
09:57 - color before i let it add another point
10:12 - so if it's touching that color then it's
10:14 - going to add a point and then wait until
10:16 - it's not touching the color before it
10:18 - moves on
10:28 - same with the other side
10:31 - but you never want to have a weight
10:34 - inside your forever loop
10:36 - mixed in with other code that needs to
10:38 - be running all the time
10:41 - so we've got to get another
10:43 - green flag
10:48 - and a forever loop
10:55 - and then these things can wait
10:58 - and it won't affect our other forever
11:00 - loop
11:10 - and that's all you need for a simple
11:12 - game upon
