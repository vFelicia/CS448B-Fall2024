00:10 - welcome to scratch junior coding this is
00:13 - a series of videos to help you learn to
00:15 - code using scratch junior
00:18 - on scratch junior you can create your
00:20 - own stories riddles games and whatever
00:23 - else you want to create
00:25 - you're in control of everything and the
00:27 - programs that you write
00:29 - you will need the scratch junior app on
00:31 - your ipad android tablet or computer
00:35 - scratch junior is a free download and
00:38 - you'll have to get it so that you can do
00:40 - coding with us today you're going to
00:42 - learn how to bring your own pictures
00:43 - into scratch junior and you're going to
00:45 - create something like this
00:48 - knock knock who's there
00:50 - hatch
00:51 - hat you bless you
00:54 - this is lesson number nine
00:56 - we're going to use a lot of the things
00:58 - that we've already learned in previous
01:00 - lessons so if you haven't seen those you
01:02 - may need to watch lessons one through
01:04 - seven first
01:05 - i have different scenes set up over here
01:08 - on the right
01:09 - we don't really need that i just made
01:11 - that to show you a couple different ways
01:13 - to time this because
01:16 - the guy in orange is wanting to tell a
01:18 - knock knock joke to his friend in green
01:21 - so he can't say knock knock at the same
01:24 - time as the boy in green says who who's
01:27 - there
01:28 - he has to say knock knock
01:30 - who's there
01:31 - then the orange says hatch and then the
01:33 - green says hatch who
01:35 - and then the orange guy finishes the
01:37 - joke by saying bless you
01:44 - it has to happen in order that way we've
01:46 - used message blocks before and we used
01:49 - them a lot in lesson 8 but i want to
01:51 - show you one other way that you could do
01:53 - it we have the orange
01:55 - the boy in orange
01:57 - starting when you hit the green flag he
01:59 - says knock knock
02:01 - then he waits for 15
02:03 - and then he says hatch
02:05 - and then he waits for 20
02:07 - and then he says bless you
02:11 - the boy in green
02:13 - he waits in the beginning
02:15 - he's just waiting for the boy in orange
02:17 - to say knock knock
02:18 - and then he says who's there then he
02:21 - waits for 15 and then he says hat you
02:24 - so if you can get all these timings
02:26 - right
02:27 - like do you wait for 10 or do you wait
02:29 - for 15 in the beginning
02:31 - you can just play around with it let's
02:33 - make it bigger and watch
02:36 - knock knock who's there
02:38 - hatch
02:40 - hat too
02:41 - bless you so that's one way to do it but
02:43 - this is a more advanced lesson so we're
02:45 - going to play with these message blocks
02:48 - and if you look at the way i've done it
02:50 - the joke starts with the boy in orange
02:54 - when when i hit the green flag he says
02:57 - knock knock
02:59 - and then he sends an orange message now
03:01 - let's look at the
03:03 - boy in green
03:05 - when he sees an orange message he says
03:07 - who's there
03:08 - and he sends a red message
03:12 - and if the boy in orange sees that
03:14 - somebody has sent a red message he says
03:17 - hatch and he sends a yellow message
03:21 - and if the boy in green sees a yellow
03:24 - message he says hat you and sends a
03:27 - green message
03:29 - and then the boy in orange finishes the
03:31 - joke when he sees a green message he
03:33 - says bless you
03:43 - so are you ready to make a knock knock
03:44 - joke start a new project
03:47 - remove the default character
03:50 - and go to the backgrounds
03:52 - you saw from my other project
03:54 - those were not characters that you find
03:56 - in scratch junior when you first open it
03:58 - up this is a picture of my playroom you
04:01 - can't bring in pictures into scratch
04:03 - junior but you can take pictures so if i
04:06 - want my own background i go to edit the
04:09 - background
04:11 - i click on the
04:12 - camera
04:14 - click in there
04:16 - and it lets me take a picture of my room
04:24 - and that's now the background
04:27 - in my project
04:29 - another way we can personalize
04:32 - is with our characters
04:34 - have you noticed
04:36 - you have a lot of characters with faces
04:39 - and then you have a whole nother group
04:40 - of characters that don't have faces
04:44 - do you know what that's for
04:45 - when you edit one of those
04:48 - and click on the camera
04:51 - and click on the face
04:53 - it lets you take a picture i'm not going
04:56 - to take a picture of me i have this
04:57 - little clown friend
05:00 - because he's such a funny guy and he
05:02 - likes to tell knock knock jokes
05:05 - you can also change
05:07 - the way these
05:09 - characters look
05:12 - i can change his shirt
05:15 - i'm using the paint bucket to just dump
05:17 - some different colors on him
05:28 - let's get another character
05:32 - we'll call him boy two
05:38 - and call the guy that likes to tell
05:40 - jokes boy one
05:48 - and put them in my playroom
05:50 - that is one of the main things that
05:52 - you're going to learn in today's lesson
05:54 - is how to change your background
05:56 - to a real picture
05:58 - and how to change a face on one of your
06:00 - characters to a real picture
06:03 - you can put your face here
06:10 - you could make yourself an astronaut
06:13 - click on the picture
06:15 - and then click where you want to take
06:16 - the picture
06:18 - [Music]
06:20 - and i took a picture
06:25 - of my spider-man
06:28 - that's how i make spider-man an
06:29 - astronaut
06:41 - but besides bringing in your own
06:42 - pictures today we're going to practice
06:44 - with the message blocks because a lot of
06:47 - the scenes and games and things that
06:49 - you're going to want to create
06:50 - your characters will need to communicate
06:53 - with each other
06:54 - today the characters have to communicate
06:56 - back and forth and the timing of that is
06:59 - very important
07:01 - so boy one is going to start
07:03 - when the green flag starts
07:10 - and he'll say
07:13 - knock
07:14 - knock and boy two will say
07:21 - who's there
07:25 - so how will
07:28 - boyd2 know when to say who's there do we
07:30 - do it with the green flag
07:32 - what happens
07:33 - they both say it at the same time that
07:35 - is not going to work you knew that
07:39 - so when boy one says knock knock
07:42 - then he'll send a letter
07:45 - to boy two
07:47 - he's gonna send an orange letter to boy
07:49 - two
07:52 - so boy two says
07:53 - when i get an orange letter i'll say
07:55 - who's there
07:58 - knock knock who's there
08:02 - okay so after he says who's there
08:04 - he's got to let boy one know all right
08:07 - it's your turn to talk again
08:13 - so we'll just pick the next color
08:16 - a red one
08:18 - so we'll go back to boy number one
08:21 - when you get
08:23 - a message you're opening it and so we're
08:26 - gonna open
08:29 - a red letter
08:31 - when he opens a red letter he knows it's
08:33 - his turn to continue with the joke
08:36 - so he says
08:42 - hatch
08:44 - and then he has to let boy 2 know he's
08:46 - done and it's his turn to talk
08:49 - so let's get another message block
08:53 - we're sending a message block
08:56 - so it's not open
09:03 - we'll send a yellow one this time
09:06 - boy two
09:10 - if he sees a yellow
09:12 - message
09:13 - he's gonna open it
09:18 - and say
09:23 - hatch
09:24 - who
09:28 - and then he has to let boy one know
09:31 - it's his turn to talk
09:33 - so he has to send a message
09:37 - we'll do a green one this time
09:44 - when boy one sees
09:47 - a green
09:48 - message he'll open it
09:53 - and say
10:00 - bless you
10:02 - it's good coding practice
10:05 - to always end
10:07 - your scripts
10:13 - and let's see if this worked
10:17 - knock knock who's there
10:19 - hatch
10:20 - hatch who
10:21 - bless you
10:25 - we're gonna do one more thing today
10:27 - that we haven't done before
10:29 - and that's record sounds if i go to this
10:33 - microphone you'll remember from previous
10:35 - lessons
10:36 - you can make a pop sound that's all
10:38 - that's in here
10:40 - but if i go to this microphone
10:42 - i can
10:43 - click this red
10:44 - and it's recording me right now and then
10:46 - i'll stop i can play it back click this
10:49 - red and it's recording me right now
10:53 - what i want to record
10:56 - is who's there
11:01 - who's there
11:05 - who's there
11:08 - and we'll put that there
11:11 - instead of him
11:15 - instead of having that
11:17 - written above his head
11:22 - now we need to record hatch who
11:28 - hat two
11:32 - hat two
11:36 - and we'll put that one down here
11:39 - and get rid of
11:43 - the text
11:44 - so let's record the audio for boy number
11:47 - one
11:48 - he has three things to say
11:50 - let's record bless you
11:54 - bless you
12:00 - bless you
12:03 - okay let's record
12:06 - knock knock
12:11 - knock knock
12:18 - and let's record hatch
12:24 - hatch
12:28 - and get rid of the written hatch
12:31 - all right let's see how it goes now
12:38 - who's there
12:40 - hatch
12:42 - that's who
12:44 - bless you
12:48 - i'm not sure i like that better you
12:49 - can't really tell who's talking
12:53 - i'm going to add all that code in
12:56 - so that we have the recorded and the
12:59 - written words
13:00 - [Music]
13:47 - who's there
13:49 - hatch
13:51 - hatch who bless you
13:53 - that's the end of this lesson
13:56 - now it's your turn
13:57 - create a new project
13:59 - and for the background
14:01 - use your camera
14:02 - to bring in your own picture for at
14:04 - least one of the characters
14:06 - bring in a picture for their face
14:08 - use your face on the character
14:10 - and somewhere in your script
14:12 - use the recording option
14:14 - and say something or make a sound
14:17 - if you can do all those personalizations
14:20 - for your story then congratulations
