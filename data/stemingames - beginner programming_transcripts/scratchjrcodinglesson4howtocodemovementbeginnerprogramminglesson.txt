00:11 - welcome to scratch junior coding
00:14 - this is a series of videos to help you
00:16 - learn to code using scratch jr
00:19 - on scratch junior you can create your
00:21 - own stories riddles games and whatever
00:25 - else you want to create you're in
00:26 - control of everything in the programs
00:29 - that you write
00:30 - today you're going to create something
00:32 - like this
00:36 - i crashed into the flower
00:39 - you will need the scratch junior app on
00:41 - your ipad android tablet or computer
00:44 - scratch jr is a free download and you'll
00:47 - have to get it so that you can do coding
00:49 - with us
00:51 - launch your scratch junior and click on
00:53 - the home icon
00:54 - and then click on plus to start a new
00:57 - project when you start a new project the
00:59 - default character
01:01 - will probably be a cat you can hold down
01:04 - on it and click the x to get rid of it
01:09 - i'm going to pick
01:14 - this river scene from my background
01:17 - you can pick whatever background you
01:18 - want right here
01:20 - and then
01:21 - get the characters that you want
01:24 - pick a bicycle rider
01:31 - we need a flower for him to knock over
01:42 - so i have my two sprites or my two
01:44 - characters on the screen
01:46 - so what i want to make him do i want to
01:48 - make him drive over and hit the flower
01:50 - and it fall over
01:53 - so i select him
01:56 - and i want him to drive over
02:00 - how many times
02:04 - how about six
02:10 - we want him to start whenever i hit the
02:12 - the green flag let me reset it
02:15 - click the green flag boom he hits the
02:17 - flower
02:19 - what i want the flower to do
02:27 - is fall over
02:30 - i'll reset it hit the green flag
02:35 - well i see a couple problems to make it
02:37 - a little more realistic let's make it
02:39 - also
02:40 - kind of fly over
02:43 - and fall
02:44 - but as soon as i click on the green flag
02:47 - the flower falls over and the boy didn't
02:48 - even run over him yet
02:51 - so i need another way to make the flower
02:54 - start to fall and not with the green
02:56 - flag
02:57 - so i'll hold down right here and pull
02:59 - that over and get rid of that green flag
03:06 - but it didn't fall over how do i make it
03:08 - fall over
03:09 - let's look at our yellow blocks
03:12 - the green flag is what we've always used
03:14 - so far
03:17 - this one will make something do
03:19 - something whenever you touch it you
03:21 - click on it with the mouse
03:23 - or you touch it on your screen
03:27 - let me reset
03:29 - and if i touch the flower then it
03:31 - happens if i touch it
03:34 - every time i touch it it does the
03:35 - commands
03:42 - but i don't want to click on it
03:45 - i want it to fall over
03:47 - when another character bumps into it
03:50 - that's what this picture what this block
03:51 - means it means start this code whenever
03:55 - some other character on the screen bumps
03:57 - into you
04:02 - and that works
04:04 - let's go back to the boys code
04:07 - and make him start instead of on the
04:09 - green flag we'll make him start
04:12 - when we click on him
04:18 - and let's put an end
04:21 - tell it to stop the program after that
04:25 - so we'll reset
04:27 - if we hit the green flag
04:29 - nothing happens
04:31 - we have to
04:32 - touch the boy to make him start to go
04:36 - we can reset it
04:38 - go to full screen
04:40 - and when we click on the boy
04:43 - he knocks over the flower
04:46 - that's the end of this lesson now it's
04:49 - your turn
04:50 - open the scratch junior app click home
04:53 - create a new project
04:56 - pick a background
04:58 - and some kind of character
05:00 - to
05:01 - move over and hit another character
05:03 - make this character move whenever it
05:05 - gets bumped into
05:07 - and make the first character move
05:09 - whenever you touch it
05:11 - if you can write a program
05:14 - using these two yellow starting blocks
05:19 - then congratulations you've mastered
05:21 - this lesson
05:23 - you want one of your characters
05:25 - to start whenever you touch it whenever
05:27 - you click on it with your mouse or touch
05:29 - it on your screen
05:31 - and you want the other character to
05:32 - start its movement whenever it gets run
05:34 - into
