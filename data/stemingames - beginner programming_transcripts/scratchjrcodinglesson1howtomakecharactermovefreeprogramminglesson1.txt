00:10 - Welcome to ScratchJr coding. This is a 
series of videos to help you learn to code  
00:16 - using ScratchJr . On scratch junior you 
can create your own stories riddles games  
00:23 - and whatever else you want to create. 
You're in control of everything  
00:28 - in the programs that you write. Today 
you're going to create something like this
00:41 - You're going to create a 
character and make him move  
00:44 - and if you want you could give 
him his own little silly voice.  
00:50 - hi i'm Toc. i'm gonna walk in front of your 
class and jump up and down. Watch me. yay!
01:09 - To get ScratchJr first you're going to 
need an ipad or an android tablet and then  
01:16 - you'll need to get ScratchJr app from the 
apple app store or google play. it's free
01:31 - When you start scratch junior it'll look like this
01:36 - and you just click home. i've done  
01:40 - several projects and whenever you 
first open it up yours will be blank
01:47 - but it's easy to create a new 
project you just click the plus
01:53 - and you'll be starting a new project. when 
you start a project the default character  
01:59 - will show up right here. yours will 
probably be a cat instead of this blue guy.  
02:05 - you can put any character on the screen that 
you want. this is the screen that's going  
02:09 - to show up in your little skit or game 
and this is where you can change things.  
02:16 - i'm not going to use this blue guy so i'll 
hold down on him until he starts to wiggle.  
02:22 - then i'll click the x to clear that character away 
to get another character i'll click on the plus
02:36 - and these are the characters 
that i have to choose from
02:41 - let's get the frog
02:44 - and i'll click the check 
mark to put him on my screen  
02:51 - to color the entire background in all i have to 
do is select one from the backgrounds right here
03:02 - and we'll put him in the classroom 
like talk was in the classroom
03:09 - and then click the check mark to select it
03:15 - so to get any character that you 
want you select it from over here  
03:19 - and to get any background that 
you want you select it from here  
03:23 - the only other thing you need to learn how to do 
today is to make your character move and these  
03:30 - are your movement blocks all the blue ones are 
your movement blocks you also have other blocks  
03:38 - as you go through these different colors 
you'll see all the different colors on the  
03:44 - other categories of blocks but let's focus on the 
blue ones because that's movement and we want our  
03:49 - frog to move this is your programming area this 
is where your programs are going to be and i have  
03:56 - a frog right here because he's selected and so 
anything i put here it's going to make the frog do
04:04 - if i put a go right block and 
i click on it he goes right  
04:10 - if i put a go left and click on it he goes left
04:17 - this one is jump up and down
04:21 - if i do just up
04:25 - then he goes up and he doesn't 
come back down unless i put a down  
04:32 - there if i snap these blocks together he'll 
do all of these with just me clicking one time
04:49 - another way to start these instead of clicking 
on these blue blocks would be to click on this  
04:54 - green flag but to make that work i have to 
get the green flag at the beginning and then  
05:02 - i can click on the green flag to make all of it 
work and i can make it bigger and then click on  
05:10 - the green flag when i'm done with my little play 
that i've written and you could give him a voice
05:18 - now it's your turn open your scratch junior 
app click the plus to create a new project
05:30 - click the landscape button and pick 
a background and then click the check
05:41 - you could even keep the character that's there 
or if you want a different one delete that one
05:50 - select it and then click the 
check to get a new character
05:57 - and then add some movement for your character
06:02 - if i want to make him jump a bunch of times you 
can just drag that down there a bunch of times
06:10 - put the green flag in the beginning
06:14 - and then make your character move
06:18 - if you can do that then you've mastered the 
first lesson congratulations you wrote a program  
06:25 - now you can be the voice for your 
character and make him jump and talk  
06:31 - what else would you like to make your character 
do would you like to make a longer movie with him  
06:38 - would you like to turn him into a video game
06:46 - keep practicing and you'll be creating games 
and longer stories soon i'll be back to help  
06:52 - you on your learning journey be sure to
