00:01 - welcome to scratch coding with scratch
00:04 - you can create your own stories puzzles
00:06 - games and whatever else you want to
00:08 - create
00:09 - you're in control of everything and the
00:11 - programs that you write
00:14 - today we're going to create a game where
00:17 - you can spawn axolotls
00:19 - you can pick different colors and spawn
00:21 - as many as you want
00:25 - if you're a novice at scratch then you
00:28 - can remix my code and i'll give you a
00:30 - link to that project in the description
00:33 - below
00:34 - if you're more hardcore
00:36 - then you can just remix my project
00:38 - axolotl resources and write all the code
00:40 - yourself
00:42 - if you're a code ninja then you may want
00:44 - to create a new project
00:46 - and get your own resources and write
00:48 - your code
00:50 - so we're going to start at novice level
00:53 - there's a link below to my project spawn
00:56 - axolotls you can remix this project and
00:59 - change whatever you want first let's run
01:01 - the program and see what it does
01:04 - when you click on the egg it spawns
01:05 - axolotls
01:10 - you can also hit the space bar
01:13 - this is the easter color axolotls
01:16 - there's also camouflage
01:22 - neon color
01:27 - and this button
01:28 - makes an axolotl let's keep an eye on
01:30 - him that changes color as he goes along
01:34 - so the axolotls just go off the screen a
01:36 - little bit turn around and come back in
01:37 - another direction as they go back and
01:40 - forth they get smaller
01:41 - and darker the axolotls go at different
01:44 - speeds and as they get smaller into the
01:47 - background you can really tell that some
01:48 - of them are going really slow and others
01:50 - are going fast it's fun to just create a
01:53 - bunch of these and let them swim around
01:55 - like you have an aquarium
01:57 - let's look at the code for the egg when
02:00 - the program starts the first type of
02:02 - axolotl that it's going to make
02:04 - is this purple kind
02:06 - and it goes to the front layer
02:08 - because you want the egg in front of all
02:10 - the other axolotls that have been
02:12 - created
02:13 - when this sprite is clicked when the egg
02:15 - is clicked it makes the egg move it
02:18 - glides a little bit
02:19 - and it creates a clone of the type of
02:21 - axolotl that's selected
02:25 - it does the same thing when the space
02:27 - key is pressed
02:30 - notice on these buttons
02:32 - whichever one i select has a yellow
02:34 - border
02:37 - let's look at the code for the buttons
02:39 - when i click the easter button
02:42 - it's going to select this purple axolotl
02:44 - as the type
02:46 - but you can't see it okay this is the
02:48 - purple one brown yellow
02:50 - and this one is all colors so it's going
02:52 - to select this purple one as the type
02:55 - and it's going to broadcast easter
02:58 - to let all the other buttons know that
02:59 - easter is selected let's look at the
03:01 - costumes for the easter button
03:04 - b is just the normal easter
03:07 - and b2 is the one that has a yellow
03:09 - border for when it's selected
03:12 - and you'll see the code whenever it's
03:14 - clicked it selects the one that has the
03:16 - yellow border b2
03:18 - if anything else is clicked then it
03:20 - changes back to the one
03:23 - that has easter not selected when the
03:25 - game starts or if it's clicked on it's
03:28 - going to change to b2 because that's the
03:30 - one that's highlighted but if any of
03:32 - these other ones are selected then it's
03:34 - going to change it back to just b
03:36 - which is not a yellow border same thing
03:38 - for all these other buttons they have a
03:39 - couple of different costumes and they
03:41 - switch to the highlighted one whenever
03:43 - they're clicked on so all this extra
03:45 - code whenever it receives these messages
03:47 - is just to change the border around the
03:49 - biggest part of this is setting the
03:51 - right type so if camo is clicked on then
03:54 - it's going to change the type that's
03:56 - just a variable to brown
03:59 - if neon is clicked on
04:01 - then it's going to change the type
04:03 - to yellow so these buttons all they do
04:06 - is set the variable type so you don't
04:08 - know what type of axolotl to create
04:11 - the axolotl actually gets created in the
04:14 - egg code right here whenever it's
04:16 - clicked
04:17 - create a clone of whatever type is
04:19 - selected and inside the axolotls
04:24 - when he starts as a clone it has all the
04:26 - code to move back and forth to get
04:28 - smaller to get darker
04:30 - so the main sprite is hidden whenever
04:32 - the green flag is clicked but every time
04:35 - it starts as a clone it's going to pick
04:37 - a random color
04:39 - and a random speed between 6 and 10
04:42 - it sets the size
04:44 - tells him to go in front of all these
04:45 - other axolotls but then go backward so
04:48 - you're not in front of the egg or in
04:50 - front of the buttons
04:51 - point in a random direction
04:54 - and you're going to be moving left and
04:55 - right
04:56 - not spinning all around
04:59 - and forever you just keep moving back
05:00 - and forth
05:02 - as long as they're pretty big it's going
05:03 - to make it smaller
05:05 - and make it go slower because when
05:07 - things are further away it looks like
05:08 - they're going slower also when things
05:10 - are further away especially if they're
05:12 - in the water then they're not going to
05:14 - look so bright so we change the
05:16 - brightness as they go back
05:18 - we also go to next costume i didn't show
05:20 - you that
05:21 - we're going through
05:23 - 40 different costumes to make him swim
05:25 - around
05:28 - so the motion just going through next
05:29 - costume next costume makes it look like
05:31 - he's swimming and the code for all these
05:33 - axolotls is the same when they start as
05:36 - a clone
05:37 - they do the same thing
05:38 - and this random color effect even though
05:40 - i picked neon
05:42 - it's going to be a random neon kind of
05:44 - color they're not all the same because
05:46 - of this random color effect if you were
05:48 - to remix this project what would you
05:51 - want to add what could we change to make
05:53 - it even better leave a comment below
05:55 - about what should be added to make this
05:57 - even better and after you've made
05:59 - changes yourself add your project to my
06:01 - axolotl studio
06:04 - if you're not a novice and you're more
06:06 - hardcore
06:07 - then you may want to start with this
06:10 - i'm also going to share this project
06:13 - axolotl resources
06:17 - i've given you the background
06:23 - and the costumes for the sprites
06:30 - but not the code
06:31 - you'll have to write your own code let's
06:34 - just write something real quick
06:36 - so for this yellow axolotl
06:40 - we need when green flag clicked
06:43 - and we need him to show
06:46 - he's too small
06:50 - he's at 20 right there
06:55 - let's set him to 40.
07:03 - go to a random position
07:10 - we don't want him spinning around so
07:11 - we'll set the rotation style to left and
07:14 - right
07:19 - and forever
07:23 - we want him to move
07:27 - and then bounce when he gets to the edge
07:32 - we want him to do this when he starts as
07:33 - a clone so we can have more than one
07:35 - axolotl
07:40 - so that's down here in the control
07:42 - blocks
07:44 - when i start as a clone
07:47 - so create a clone of myself and there he
07:49 - goes
07:55 - now all these are
07:56 - yellow we can put this code
07:59 - in the all axolotl colors
08:05 - create a clone of myself
08:10 - oh and i need to make him show
08:18 - but they're still not changing color
08:22 - i forgot to make him change costumes
08:26 - costumes is going to be in the looks
08:31 - we just need the next costume block
08:37 - we also want the code for this one to
08:39 - change costumes
08:42 - yeah that makes them look like they're
08:43 - swimming
08:46 - when they start we want the original one
08:48 - to be hidden though
08:51 - we want the
08:52 - clones to show
08:54 - but we want the original one to hide
09:00 - i want to add this set color effect too
09:03 - so we can get some variation in the
09:04 - colors
09:14 - and this one needs to hide when the
09:15 - green flag is clicked
09:18 - and you can change the speed and the
09:20 - size and the color and everything
09:22 - and just do as much as you want with
09:24 - this
09:25 - starting with my project axolotl
09:27 - resources
09:30 - but if you're a code ninja
09:32 - then you can do everything all on your
09:34 - own
09:35 - just do a new project
09:39 - and choose a backdrop
09:46 - that would be a good one for some
09:47 - axolotls to swim around in or you can
09:50 - upload a backdrop
09:53 - the backdrop from my other project
09:56 - i just did a screenshot when i was
09:57 - playing minecraft
10:00 - just click upload backdrop
10:03 - and then select the file that you got
10:05 - off the internet or you saved while you
10:07 - were playing
10:09 - i'll just select this jpeg that i made
10:12 - background.jpg
10:15 - and after it imports we have another
10:17 - background
10:19 - drag it to cover the whole screen
10:22 - and just resize it position it however
10:24 - you want
10:27 - next we need some sprites
10:30 - i uploaded a sprite for the egg
10:35 - again i got that off minecraft
10:37 - i just copied that and edited it out and
10:40 - made the background transparent to make
10:42 - a png file
10:49 - and then just resized and positioned
10:51 - that and that looks just like my other
10:53 - game
10:56 - for the axolotls
10:58 - we have to upload a sprite
11:03 - and i found a gif file
11:05 - on the internet that had a lot of
11:07 - different costumes
11:09 - let me show you get one gif file
11:11 - that moves
11:14 - and once it's imported in
11:19 - look at the costumes for that
11:23 - that has all the different colors
11:30 - there's 40 white ones 40 yellow ones 40
11:33 - brown ones
11:37 - i'm gonna just right click on this
11:39 - axolotl and duplicate it
11:45 - rename it yellow
11:54 - and delete all the costumes that aren't
11:56 - yellow
12:11 - and now it's just the yellow one
12:14 - let's add a little code for this guy
12:18 - forever
12:20 - go to the next costume
12:24 - so forever he goes to the next costume
12:28 - and just like in the other projects
12:30 - we can make clones of him and make him
12:32 - move around and change colors and
12:35 - and do whatever we want
12:37 - so whether you're a novice hardcore or a
12:39 - code ninja add your projects to my
12:42 - axolotl studio
