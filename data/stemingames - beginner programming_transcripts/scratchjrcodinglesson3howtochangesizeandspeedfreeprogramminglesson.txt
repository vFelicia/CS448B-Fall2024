00:10 - welcome to scratch junior coding
00:13 - this is a series of videos to help you
00:15 - learn to code using scratch jr
00:19 - on scratch junior you can create your
00:21 - own stories riddles games and whatever
00:24 - else you want to create
00:26 - you're in control of everything in the
00:28 - programs that you write
00:30 - today you're going to create something
00:32 - like this
00:35 - two cars on race day
00:38 - and the girl won and she said yay
00:44 - we'll have to put the cars on the screen
00:46 - and make them smaller because when you
00:48 - first put them on there they're bigger
00:50 - than this
00:51 - and we'll have to make them race across
00:52 - the screen
00:55 - and then make the girl say something
00:57 - you will need the scratch junior app on
00:59 - your ipad android tablet or computer
01:02 - scratch junior is a free download and
01:05 - you'll have to get it so that you can do
01:07 - coding with us
01:09 - launch scratch junior and click the home
01:11 - icon
01:12 - click on this plus to start a new
01:15 - project
01:16 - you'll probably have a cat here for your
01:18 - first character if you hold down on it
01:21 - and click the x it'll go away unless you
01:23 - want the cat to race and that would be
01:25 - fine too
01:26 - to change the background you click on
01:28 - this landscape at the top
01:30 - and that brings up the background
01:32 - gallery
01:33 - i want my cars to race down this street
01:36 - so i select the city
01:38 - and click the check
01:40 - and i want to pick two cars
01:43 - over here is where you pick the
01:45 - characters that are going to be on your
01:46 - screen
01:47 - scratch junior calls it sprites so the
01:50 - two sprites that we're going to have are
01:52 - two cars
02:01 - i'll find the girl
02:03 - and say i want to get that
02:07 - and then i'll go back in there
02:12 - and find the boy
02:14 - and then say yes i want to get that
02:16 - but they're way too big
02:19 - to be on my street
02:22 - so i have the boy selected
02:24 - if i want to shrink him down
02:27 - the purple blocks change how your sprite
02:30 - looks or how your character looks so i
02:32 - think shrinking down is going to be in
02:34 - there
02:38 - yeah so this one
02:40 - will make it shrink down by two
02:43 - so i'll get that block and click on it
02:45 - and my car shrink down
02:49 - i'll change to the girl
02:52 - and get the shrink block for her
02:54 - and click on it
02:56 - a couple times
02:58 - is that small enough
03:02 - let's make it even smaller i'll select
03:04 - the boy
03:07 - and shrink him down too
03:18 - and once you think that small enough
03:20 - you can get rid of your shrinking blocks
03:25 - and you'll remember from the other
03:26 - lessons when i click on the girl this is
03:29 - the programming area
03:31 - for that character
03:32 - when i click on this one this is the
03:35 - programming area for him
03:37 - so i want to make them race across the
03:39 - screen
03:41 - do you remember which color blocks are
03:44 - the movement blocks
03:46 - it's the blue ones
03:51 - so if i have a blue to the right that
03:53 - makes him move to the right
03:57 - i don't want to keep clicking that
04:01 - i could make it repeat forever then what
04:04 - happens
04:07 - he just keeps going and going
04:14 - if i want to make him start doing that
04:15 - when i hit the green flag
04:17 - i'll put the green flag there
04:19 - and then he's racing across the screen
04:24 - let's give the red car some code we'll
04:26 - give her a flag
04:29 - we'll tell her to move right
04:32 - and to do that
04:34 - in a loop like forever
04:36 - so there they both go
04:41 - instead of just looping forever like
04:43 - that let's make them go just to the
04:45 - right side of the screen
04:47 - so we don't want to go forever
04:51 - let's see
04:53 - if we change this number what happens
04:55 - let's change it to eight
05:02 - and you see this is the girl's car so
05:05 - that's how far she made it if she goes
05:07 - eight steps let's put them both at the
05:09 - beginning
05:14 - and see that was eight steps
05:18 - let's change her to
05:21 - if i remember from the last one i think
05:24 - it was 17.
05:30 - does that get her all the way across
05:32 - nope that's too much
05:35 - what about 15.
05:43 - okay so 15 gets her all the way to the
05:45 - end
05:50 - and then stop
05:59 - for the boy let's let him move across
06:02 - 15 steps
06:05 - and then stop
06:16 - so we got both of the cars to move
06:19 - across the screen all the way to the
06:20 - right what's left to do today one of
06:23 - them needs to win
06:25 - how can we make the girl got to win last
06:28 - time how can we make the boy go faster
06:39 - these are the movement blocks
06:41 - these are how something looks it changes
06:44 - the way it looks
06:45 - this is the sound blocks to make the boy
06:48 - go faster
06:50 - we can find that in one of the orange
06:52 - blocks
06:53 - this one right here
06:59 - you see the little
07:00 - triangle there it's a down arrow if you
07:02 - click that you can see this makes him go
07:05 - slow
07:06 - this is medium and this is fast
07:09 - let's put this in there
07:12 - before he moves we're going to change
07:14 - his speed
07:20 - let's go
07:21 - to the first one
07:25 - that's how fast the first one is
07:32 - this is how fast the second one is
07:38 - and then this is the fastest that's what
07:40 - we want for him the fastest
07:42 - let's go pick a speed for her
07:45 - we'll make her go
07:47 - the middle one
07:56 - and he won that looks like the other
07:58 - video
08:00 - all we need to do now is let him say
08:02 - something
08:05 - so we click on him so we can add
08:07 - something for him to say
08:09 - where do you think
08:10 - speaking would be in our blocks
08:13 - the speaking is going to give him a
08:14 - little bubble above his head so it kind
08:16 - of in a way changes the way he looks
08:20 - and so they put that in the looks
08:23 - category of blocks
08:25 - and there it is right there
08:28 - if i click that he says hi
08:33 - if we change it to
08:37 - i1
08:41 - and we click it he says i won
08:44 - so where would we put that
08:46 - we're gonna just drag it into the here
08:49 - so we got the start on green flag
08:51 - and go really fast and go 15 steps to
08:55 - the right
08:56 - and then after that
08:58 - say i won
09:00 - and then you're done
09:01 - so if we reset them
09:06 - it worked
09:08 - so we'll make it full screen
09:11 - and we'll run our program
09:16 - great race
09:21 - [Music]
09:25 - we can change the name of it
09:38 - and put a title up there if we want
09:47 - that's the end of this lesson now it's
09:49 - your turn
09:50 - open the scratch junior app click home
09:53 - create a new project
09:55 - add a background here
09:58 - add a couple of cars right here
10:00 - and make your two cars race
10:02 - if you want at the end you could tell it
10:05 - to say i won or yay for whoever the
10:07 - winner is
10:08 - you could put a title up here and change
10:11 - the name of it but if you can add two
10:13 - cars and make them race across the
10:15 - screen at different speeds then
10:17 - congratulations you've mastered the
10:19 - third lesson
10:24 - this free kids coding lesson was
10:26 - provided by stem and games subscribe
10:29 - watch more lessons and keep practicing
10:32 - and soon you will be creating new worlds
10:34 - and games and making your ideas come to
10:37 - life i'll see you next time
