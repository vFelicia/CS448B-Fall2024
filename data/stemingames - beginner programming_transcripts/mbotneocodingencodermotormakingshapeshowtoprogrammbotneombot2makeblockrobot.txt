00:01 - welcome to coding with Neo this is the
00:05 - mbot 2 also known as the inbot Neo from
00:08 - make block
00:12 - you program it with block programming
00:14 - just like you do in scratch so if you
00:16 - know how to do scratch it'll be easy for
00:18 - you
00:20 - I'm going to skip all the how to connect
00:22 - and disconnect and upload and all that
00:25 - stuff today we're going to be
00:25 - programming in live we're just going to
00:28 - do some simple shapes so we're going to
00:30 - make him move around in some simple
00:32 - shapes and you have to get an extension
00:36 - called the inbot 2 shield so that you
00:39 - can control his Motors
00:41 - and let's start off doing a square
00:44 - so if we want to move forward
00:47 - and then turn left
00:50 - let's go forward 20 centimeters see if
00:55 - that's far enough
00:56 - and we need to do that four times to
00:58 - make a square
01:05 - and we'll just make him go let's see
01:07 - what happens
01:09 - yeah 20 centimeters was enough
01:12 - and just make him go around in a simple
01:14 - Square
01:16 - and of course 90 degrees makes a square
01:20 - let's do three turns at 120 and make a
01:24 - triangle
01:33 - and I'm just clicking on it to make it
01:35 - run just like in scratch you can have
01:37 - when the green flags clicked
01:48 - did it really make a triangle
01:50 - it's a little off
01:54 - there's a little slippage depending on
01:55 - your surfaces so sometimes you can't get
01:58 - the exact right shape or the exact same
02:00 - distance if you say 20 centimeters you
02:02 - might get 19 out of it
02:06 - besides just
02:08 - moving forward and turning left there's
02:10 - other controls
02:13 - you can move each wheel a certain speed
02:17 - let's just move forward a certain speed
02:24 - let's go back to
02:27 - doing a square
02:29 - all right so we'll move forward at 50
02:31 - rpns RPMs revolutions per minute
02:35 - then we'll turn
02:37 - let's do a square
02:42 - let me get rid of all this okay so turn
02:44 - left 90.
02:45 - and we're going to do 50 RPMs
02:51 - four times
03:05 - we have a diamond going on here
03:09 - instead of a square close enough
03:11 - so what happens if we go 100 revolutions
03:15 - per minute
03:35 - see if he can handle 200
03:44 - foreign
03:47 - to go here
03:49 - we go
03:55 - he's climbing up my lamp over there
04:02 - he's gone okay so let's not do it for a
04:04 - second let's do it for a third of a
04:06 - second
04:23 - popping wheelies
04:30 - what can we do next
04:32 - we need to make a circle how can we make
04:34 - a circle
04:36 - if we go forward and left and forward
04:38 - and left that's that's going to be too
04:40 - jerky that's not going to make a good
04:41 - Circle
04:43 - we need to play around with some of the
04:44 - other blocks
04:47 - what happens if we move
04:50 - the left wheel
04:52 - at 50 RPMs for one second
04:57 - so we're moving the left wheel which
04:59 - makes him turn right what happens if we
05:02 - move the right wheel for one second
05:10 - that is making him go backwards
05:15 - so it's the right wheel
05:17 - but the right wheel is rolling backwards
05:20 - so when we use the right wheel we need
05:21 - to do
05:27 - negative
05:36 - to get what would we would expect to
05:39 - make him turn left
05:41 - so if we have the left one
05:45 - and the right one
05:49 - that is not going to be going at the
05:50 - same time they're going to go after each
05:52 - other
05:54 - he's gonna zigzag
05:59 - if we want him to go at the same time we
06:02 - got to pick this one
06:04 - so we got
06:06 - the left wheel going forward and the
06:10 - right wheel going
06:13 - backwards
06:16 - that's going to get us forward
06:21 - it's going to make us lose him
06:24 - because that does not have a stop it
06:27 - doesn't say one second or for a distance
06:29 - or anything so we got a stop motor and
06:31 - go find him
06:42 - so if we wanted to make a circle all we
06:44 - would have to do is make the left one go
06:47 - less than the right one
07:00 - so I think that's pretty good for our
07:01 - first lesson we can make a square
07:03 - multiple ways we can make a triangle a
07:05 - circle

07:08 - don't miss any of the lessons of coding
07:10 - with Neo I'll see you next time bye bye
