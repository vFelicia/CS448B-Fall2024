00:01 - welcome to scratch coding with scratch
00:04 - you can create your own stories puzzles
00:06 - games and whatever else you want to
00:08 - create
00:09 - you're in control of everything and the
00:11 - programs that you write
00:14 - today we're going to create something
00:16 - like this it's ultimate pong there's
00:19 - power-ups and tricks you're going to
00:21 - love creating this so you can play with
00:23 - your friends
00:25 - first we're going to create a regular
00:26 - pawn game
00:28 - get rid of scratch
00:31 - and draw a background
00:35 - with no outline
00:42 - we need one rectangle
00:44 - that's the whole
00:45 - playing chord
00:47 - then we need a slightly different color
00:50 - on each side
01:00 - and just for looks i want a white line
01:02 - down the middle
01:08 - and i can hold shift down to make sure
01:10 - the line's straight
01:13 - there's not going to be any code for the
01:14 - background
01:16 - now i need some sprites
01:20 - i'm going to need a ball
01:26 - and a paddle
01:31 - and of course you can change the color
01:32 - of the paddle
01:34 - but i'll just leave it like this to save
01:35 - us some time
01:40 - the code for the paddle needs to tell it
01:44 - to turn this way
01:46 - and then i want to move it all the way
01:47 - over to the left
01:49 - that's going to be negative 227
01:54 - we'll just go ahead and type in zero to
01:56 - put it in the middle
02:00 - whenever the game starts we want it to
02:01 - go to the middle and point in the right
02:03 - direction
02:05 - we'll call this one left paddle
02:08 - we need the paddle to move up and down
02:10 - since this paddle's on the left it's
02:11 - going to move up when i press w and down
02:14 - when i press s
02:17 - you can put the code for it
02:20 - when w is pressed
02:25 - change y by 10 and that works
02:31 - and when s is pressed change y by
02:34 - negative 10.
02:37 - but there's a delay when you do that
02:40 - it should work just fine but for some
02:41 - reason it doesn't work really well when
02:43 - two people are playing
02:45 - and so i'm not going to put it
02:49 - in the code when that key is pressed i'm
02:51 - going to have it in a forever loop
02:55 - so forever it's going to keep checking
02:57 - to see if the button is pressed
03:07 - and if key w is pressed we're going to
03:09 - move up by 10
03:14 - and if s is pressed we're going to move
03:16 - down by 10. just works so much better
03:19 - it's a lot smoother
03:24 - it's not as jerky i don't know if you
03:26 - can tell the difference
03:30 - now we're going to duplicate the left
03:31 - paddle
03:35 - to give us a right paddle
03:40 - and we'll just put it
03:43 - the same place but on the right hand
03:44 - side
03:48 - and it's going to go up and down when
03:50 - the up arrow
03:51 - and the down arrow is pressed
04:00 - works really well
04:04 - okay for the ball
04:10 - let's just start off smaller
04:20 - and forever we want it to move
04:24 - and bounce
04:32 - when the game first starts we want it to
04:34 - start in the middle
04:36 - at 0 0
04:39 - but we want it to change
04:41 - to not go just straight back and forth
04:46 - change 90 to 95
04:49 - to be off a little bit
04:53 - there now it's not just bouncing
04:54 - straight back and forth
04:59 - we're going to need a couple variables
05:01 - to keep score
05:05 - left score
05:09 - and right score
05:10 - and if it touches this left wall
05:13 - then the right player should score a
05:15 - point and if it touches this color
05:18 - and hits the right wall
05:20 - then the left player should score a
05:22 - point
05:30 - if touching the left color blue
05:39 - then change the right score by one
05:46 - so forever it's going to check and if
05:48 - it's touching that color blue right here
05:51 - then right scores a point
05:57 - problem is
05:58 - it's looping through this so fast that
06:02 - it gets a couple of points every time it
06:04 - touches the wall so we need to slow it
06:05 - down a little bit
06:09 - so it'll give them a point
06:11 - and then it'll wait until it's not
06:14 - touching that color anymore
06:21 - copy that
06:23 - so that the
06:25 - left player can make some points
06:27 - and this color
06:32 - we're going to suck up some of this
06:33 - color on the right
06:40 - and in the beginning of the game we need
06:42 - the score to go back to zero
06:48 - set less score to zero and set right
06:50 - score to zero
06:53 - now we just need the ball to bounce off
06:54 - the paddles
06:58 - if the ball touches
07:00 - the left paddle
07:02 - will change direction
07:05 - to make it change directions we'll tell
07:08 - it to go
07:10 - its current direction plus 170.
07:15 - and just like we did for the weight
07:17 - until not touching the blue wall we need
07:19 - to make it wait until not touching the
07:21 - paddle or it'll keep changing directions
07:24 - so if the ball hits the left paddle
07:26 - it'll just change directions
07:29 - want to duplicate that
07:31 - so that it'll bounce off the right
07:33 - paddle
07:41 - and we'll make it bounce just a little
07:42 - different instead of 170 we'll go with
07:44 - 190
07:55 - and we can just change to the large
07:56 - readout
07:57 - so we'll have the score at the top
08:03 - and that's all the code you need for a
08:05 - regular game of pong to play with two
08:07 - players
08:10 - but let's make it even more fun
08:13 - let's add a new sprite
08:15 - and pick the star
08:21 - now i'm just adding some
08:24 - fun code to make the star twinkle and
08:26 - spin a little bit
08:40 - when the program starts
08:42 - the star is going to hide
08:45 - and go to a random position
08:52 - we pick a random number for x and a
08:54 - random number for y
08:57 - somewhere near the middle
09:05 - when the game first starts he won't be
09:06 - there we'll let the players play for
09:08 - just a few seconds
09:10 - and then he'll show up
09:19 - and then forever if he gets hit by the
09:21 - ball he's going to move to another place
09:30 - now what this power up is going to do is
09:32 - make the ball go faster
09:34 - so we're going to need a variable for
09:36 - the ball speed
09:40 - so this is the star code
09:43 - and if the star is touching the ball
09:46 - he's going to go somewhere else
09:48 - and we need to make the ball go faster
09:51 - so we'll set speed
09:56 - let's just make it 11
10:01 - for a couple of seconds
10:09 - let's make it 12
10:10 - for a couple of seconds and then we'll
10:12 - change the speed to 8.
10:14 - so we need to set the speed to 8 in the
10:16 - beginning
10:19 - so that'll be our normal speed and we
10:21 - need to make the ball go
10:26 - that fast
10:30 - right now the ball is moving 10 steps
10:37 - in this forever loop he needs to be
10:39 - moving speed
10:43 - all right let's see if that power-up
10:45 - works
10:48 - when we start playing it's going at a
10:49 - speed of eight
10:57 - and it definitely got faster
11:01 - there for a couple of seconds when we
11:02 - hit the star
11:06 - i figured out a cheat that's kind of
11:08 - funny you can put it in the code for the
11:10 - ball
11:12 - instead of pointing in the other
11:14 - direction whenever you hit the paddle
11:21 - you can point towards
11:23 - the other paddle
11:25 - so when the ball hits the left paddle
11:28 - it'll point towards the right paddle
11:33 - so no matter where the right paddle is
11:35 - whenever the left paddle hits the ball
11:37 - the ball is going to go towards the
11:39 - right paddle
11:48 - that would be very sneaky to put that
11:50 - code in your program whenever you were
11:52 - playing your friends
11:53 - don't do that unless they have a really
11:55 - good sense of humor
12:01 - i'm going to change that back
12:09 - we don't need to be able to see speed
12:10 - anymore
12:12 - go to our variables
12:15 - and turn that off
12:17 - another thing that's fun that you never
12:19 - see in regular pong
12:25 - is a lightning bolt flying out of the
12:27 - paddle and making you turn invisible
12:30 - but since we're writing the code we can
12:31 - do that
12:36 - okay this lightning bolt is going to
12:37 - hide
12:39 - and turn sideways he's got a point in
12:42 - the direction zero
12:47 - make him smaller
12:48 - and for the left lightning bolt if i
12:50 - press d
13:02 - he's going to start off at the left
13:03 - paddle
13:09 - then he's going to show
13:11 - he's going to be visible
13:18 - and then he's going to glide over to the
13:20 - right
13:24 - at the same y position
13:26 - so
13:27 - at the same y position is going to make
13:29 - him just go straight across
13:37 - and then he needs to hide again
13:42 - and we'll make another one to go the
13:44 - other direction
13:47 - we'll call him left lightning and right
13:49 - lightning
13:51 - and he'll shoot when the left arrow is
13:53 - pressed
13:55 - he starts at the right paddle
13:59 - and goes all the way to the left
14:02 - oh but he's going backwards
14:05 - let's flip him around
14:07 - he'll start pointing in the direction
14:09 - 180.
14:15 - and you can only shoot one at a time
14:18 - now when you get hit by a lightning bolt
14:20 - you disappear your paddle disappears
14:31 - so this is left paddle
14:33 - if he's touching
14:36 - the right's lightning
14:44 - he's going to hide
14:45 - for a couple of seconds
14:47 - or maybe just one second
14:50 - and then he'll show again
14:55 - for the right paddle
14:59 - if he's ever touching less lightning
15:07 - then he's going to hide and wait for a
15:09 - second and then show again
15:30 - it works
15:35 - so there's a few ideas i had
15:38 - about making pong even more fun
