00:00 - welcome to mbot neocoding join us as we
00:04 - have fun and learn to code our inbot Neo
00:07 - robot
00:10 - are you having trouble connecting to Neo
00:12 - what do I do let's talk about that
00:16 - it's easy to build him and he comes with
00:18 - some programs it's easy to just go
00:20 - through they're fun to play with
00:23 - and there's so many options to do after
00:25 - that that it can get confusing so let's
00:27 - talk about it if you're going to use a
00:29 - phone then you want to get the make
00:31 - block app
00:33 - if you have an iPad you want to get the
00:35 - make block app and also the M Block app
00:38 - the make block app is going to let you
00:40 - play around with Neo as if he's a remote
00:42 - control car
00:44 - but the inblock app is going to let you
00:46 - also code
00:47 - this is the make block app
00:50 - within this app you can drive around
00:52 - like embot Neo is a remote control car
00:56 - you can draw a path and he'll follow
00:58 - that path or you can play it like a
01:00 - piano
01:02 - the first thing it's going to want you
01:03 - to do is connecting through Bluetooth
01:10 - and as long as it's close it'll connect
01:11 - right up
01:14 - so you can use this
01:19 - to control him
01:31 - you can draw a path and then tell him to
01:33 - follow it
01:35 - [Music]
01:37 - and it's very obedient
01:50 - and that sound is coming from him not
01:52 - from the iPad
01:56 - if you go to code within the make block
01:58 - app it's going to take you to the M
02:00 - Block app
02:04 - and within the M Block app you're going
02:06 - to have to connect again
02:13 - and if you just hold it close
02:15 - the iPad's really good about the
02:17 - Bluetooth connection
02:23 - and from there you can write code just
02:25 - as if you were on a PC
02:27 - now let's talk about connecting with a
02:29 - PC because that's what I would prefer to
02:32 - use when I'm coding
02:34 - if I try to connect here
02:38 - even when I go to Bluetooth
02:42 - it never finds it it says I have to have
02:45 - Bluetooth 4.0 and I do
02:47 - so I ended up buying this little
02:49 - Bluetooth dongle
02:51 - and it works great
02:53 - never have any trouble connecting with
02:55 - that
02:57 - it comes with instructions that you have
02:59 - to press this little button to make it
03:01 - pair with your inbot Neo
03:03 - but it comes with this USB
03:06 - cable let's talk about using that
03:10 - of course you have to use that to charge
03:12 - him but you can also let's just pretend
03:15 - this is my computer because this is
03:17 - plugged into my computer
03:19 - but you can also connect to him
03:22 - not just charging but you can connect to
03:24 - him with this cable
03:28 - so if you have him connected to your
03:30 - computer instead of Bluetooth you would
03:33 - use USB
03:34 - and it's going to default to the right
03:36 - one
03:38 - and then you would just connect and so
03:40 - now I'm connected and I'm going to be
03:42 - live or in upload mode just like I would
03:46 - be on the iPad
03:48 - if I don't want to use the cable
03:50 - which I don't whenever I'm coding I want
03:52 - to be able to code him and let him do
03:55 - the code live without having him tie it
03:58 - down to the computer so I would prefer
04:00 - to use this USB stick it cost me 15
04:02 - bucks
04:04 - well worth it
04:07 - so when you have that Bluetooth
04:09 - connected that Bluetooth dongle
04:11 - connected you hit connect and it looks
04:13 - just like you don't pick Bluetooth over
04:15 - here you pick USB
04:19 - because the computer thinks you are
04:22 - connected through USB
04:24 - and somehow their Bluetooth connects but
04:27 - my computer
04:29 - would not connect
04:31 - the only other major issue I've had is
04:34 - whenever I was first starting to do this
04:36 - and I went to add
04:38 - there used to be an inbot Neo in here
04:41 - and so I added in by Neo and I tried to
04:43 - code him and tried to make different
04:45 - blocks work if things wouldn't work it
04:46 - was broken he's gone now so I guess they
04:49 - figured out people were using it when
04:50 - they weren't supposed to for inbox Neo
04:53 - we're supposed to use cyberpie cyberpie
04:56 - is as you know this little
04:58 - control board up here
05:01 - so make sure you pick the cyberpie for
05:03 - your device
05:05 - and this M Block that I have on my
05:07 - computer you can run that online or you
05:10 - can install it I'll have it installed
05:12 - but choosing the right device and
05:14 - getting the Bluetooth working on my
05:16 - computer is the only real trouble that
05:17 - I've had now that we're connected it's
05:19 - time to start coding like And subscribe
05:22 - so you don't miss any of the coding
05:23 - videos I'll see you next time bye bye
05:27 - foreign
