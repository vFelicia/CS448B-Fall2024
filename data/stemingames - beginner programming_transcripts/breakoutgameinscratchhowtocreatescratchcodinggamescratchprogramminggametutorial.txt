00:01 - welcome to scratch coding with scratch
00:04 - you can create your own stories puzzles
00:06 - games and whatever else you want to
00:08 - create
00:09 - you're in control of everything and the
00:11 - programs that you write
00:15 - today we're going to create something
00:17 - like this
00:19 - it's a breakout game you move the paddle
00:23 - and break all the bricks away
00:28 - breakout's been around since the 1970s
00:30 - but it's still fun
00:35 - my favorite part about playing this game
00:36 - is whenever i can get the ball past the
00:39 - top row and it just bounces around and
00:41 - gets all the bricks for me
00:45 - and this is what it would look like if
00:47 - you miss
00:50 - so let's start at the beginning
00:52 - and create a new project
00:57 - get rid of scratch cat and we need some
01:00 - bricks
01:03 - and this button will work just fine
01:05 - let's look at the costumes for this
01:07 - button
01:09 - we have just blue and gray
01:14 - i could just fill the whole thing in one
01:15 - color
01:18 - but i kind of like the shading
01:20 - so i'll do the the left color
01:22 - a lighter red and the right color a
01:25 - darker red
01:32 - and i'll duplicate that to make another
01:34 - color
01:36 - and rename the button to button one
01:40 - the next one i'll do orange
01:43 - just click on the outside
01:46 - get the select tool and click on the
01:48 - outside
01:51 - change the left color to a lighter
01:54 - orange
01:56 - and the right color
01:58 - to a darker orange
02:02 - and then click on the middle part and do
02:04 - the same thing
02:06 - a lighter orange on the left and a
02:08 - darker orange on the right
02:11 - and then duplicate that one
02:13 - so that we can make a yellow one
02:16 - and pick a light and dark yellow
02:19 - and do the same thing on the inside
02:23 - and i'll jump off a minute to make some
02:25 - more buttons
02:26 - i still have the blue
02:28 - but i added a green and a purple brick
02:31 - now let's see what code we need
02:36 - if we wanted our game to only have
02:40 - about six bricks across then we could
02:42 - leave him this size but i want it to
02:43 - have more
02:44 - so i'll make it about 30 percent let's
02:47 - see how big that is
02:49 - that's a good size to give us a bunch of
02:51 - bricks
02:57 - and i want him to start off as the first
02:59 - brick
03:04 - that'll be a red one
03:07 - and i want him to go to where he's at
03:09 - right now
03:13 - and the go to block is going to be the
03:15 - position the xy position of your brick
03:18 - right then and what i want him to do is
03:20 - to just keep drawing
03:22 - copies of himself all the way across and
03:24 - i'm not sure how many that's going to be
03:26 - just yet
03:30 - let's repeat 10 times
03:33 - and create a clone of himself
03:38 - and then he'll just move over
03:40 - so he'll create a clone of himself move
03:43 - over by 10 create a clone of himself
03:45 - move over by 10 create a clone of
03:46 - himself repeat that 10 times
03:51 - okay those are too close
03:53 - let's change our x
03:56 - by 30.
04:01 - we're going to have to stop it to get
04:02 - rid of the first ones
04:06 - and we need more of them
04:09 - how about 16
04:13 - we need to make that original guy
04:16 - not be visible because we want to just
04:18 - see the clones
04:23 - so the original sprite is hidden
04:26 - but if he starts off as a clone
04:30 - we want him to be visible so we add a
04:32 - show for him
04:34 - and then we start the other code when
04:35 - the green flag is clicked
04:39 - i'm going to adjust the numbers a little
04:41 - to make them fit better
04:44 - that's good spacing
04:47 - so we've got 16 going across
04:50 - and then we want it to go to the next
04:52 - row and do 16 more across that's a
04:54 - different color
04:59 - and remember we have
05:02 - six different colors
05:07 - so we need this one to repeat six times
05:11 - inside this repeat six times first it's
05:13 - going to draw the first row
05:20 - then it's going to go to the next
05:21 - costume which will just get a different
05:23 - color brick
05:25 - we want it to move down on the y-axis
05:28 - it's going to be a negative
05:30 - but how much
05:34 - change y by let's just say negative 10.
05:39 - and our x to start off with was a
05:41 - negative 225 so we need to go back to
05:43 - there too
05:48 - so it drew them all
05:50 - but we just need to go negative y more
05:53 - we'll try 20 negative 20.
05:58 - let's try negative 18.
06:01 - i like that spacing
06:03 - all right wait hold stop everything
06:06 - this is what the program looks like
06:09 - after it's already done but i wanted to
06:11 - add this in here because i just figured
06:12 - something out right here where it says
06:14 - next costume and we spent all that time
06:17 - working on all these costumes we didn't
06:19 - even have to do that
06:22 - it takes a while to figure out what all
06:24 - these bricks do what all this code does
06:27 - but you don't have to do next costume
06:29 - and change to the next color
06:31 - there's change color effect
06:35 - that would do the same thing
06:40 - i got a couple of rows of green here so
06:41 - let me change color effect by 30 instead
06:44 - of 25.
06:48 - and it's going to draw all those things
06:49 - for me i didn't have to do that so this
06:52 - is what the program's going to look like
06:53 - when it's completely done but i wanted
06:55 - to jump in here and show you this
06:57 - before you wasted a lot of time drawing
07:00 - all the different colors because you
07:01 - don't really have to i don't like the
07:03 - white background
07:05 - we could draw a rectangle and color it
07:08 - in
07:13 - or we could just convert to a bitmap
07:16 - and color it in that way
07:18 - okay now let's get a ball
07:22 - yellow ball is fine
07:26 - when the flags clicked
07:30 - i want him to go
07:31 - i think 30 percent of work
07:36 - i want him to go to the middle
07:42 - and forever
07:46 - move
07:48 - and bounce
07:58 - let's make him start off
08:02 - pointing
08:06 - just a little to the right
08:08 - so his life will be a little bit more
08:10 - interesting
08:12 - we need a paddle but i can't really pick
08:14 - a sprite that we already have let's draw
08:17 - one
08:19 - so we'll draw a rectangle
08:21 - i want kind of a
08:23 - greenish
08:28 - and then i want three different little
08:30 - rectangles
08:31 - so i'll copy and paste
08:33 - so i have three areas here
08:37 - and i want them to be slightly different
08:38 - colors the reason i want him to have
08:41 - three different colors is because when
08:43 - he bounces in the middle i want it to
08:45 - make the ball go straight back up and if
08:47 - he bounces on each side i want it to go
08:49 - at an angle so that we'll have a little
08:51 - bit of control when we hit the ball
08:53 - that'll be more like the original game
08:56 - and if i group them together
08:58 - i can make sure they're in the center
09:01 - we'll drag him down here to where he
09:02 - goes
09:04 - and then my go to block
09:06 - will show the right place
09:09 - when the game starts he's going to go to
09:11 - the middle
09:13 - i need a set size block
09:17 - if you want your game to be harder make
09:19 - your paddle smaller
09:21 - and what we want him to do
09:23 - you could use your arrow keys
09:30 - but what i'm going to do
09:32 - is set the x value that's how far left
09:35 - or right it is set that to the mouse
09:37 - value
09:41 - so then it just follows my mouse
09:45 - i like that better than the arrows for
09:47 - this game let's go back to the code for
09:49 - the ball
09:52 - sure it bounces when it hits the edge
09:54 - but we want it to bounce when it hits
09:55 - the paddle or when it hits a brick
09:58 - so we need some ifs
10:04 - it's touching something
10:06 - what's my bricks called that's just
10:09 - called button let's call that bricks
10:13 - so now our sprite for the bricks is
10:15 - actually called bricks
10:18 - and if our ball is touching bricks then
10:21 - let's make him change directions
10:24 - we'll make him point in a different
10:26 - direction
10:29 - it'll be direction plus
10:31 - 170 so he'll
10:34 - almost completely change direction
10:36 - because if we did it plus 180 it would
10:38 - go in the complete opposite direction
10:42 - i need another if
10:44 - if he's touching the middle
10:50 - of my paddle
10:52 - i want him to bounce straight up
10:55 - point in direction
10:58 - it's going to be zero degrees
11:00 - right click and duplicate that if
11:03 - if he's touching
11:06 - let's suck up some of that left color
11:09 - if he's touching the left of the paddle
11:16 - then we'll make him go back that way
11:22 - and if he's touching the right of the
11:23 - paddle
11:27 - will make him go a little bit bounce to
11:29 - the right
11:30 - at 45 degrees
11:34 - that has to be in that forever loop
11:43 - that's looking pretty good but
11:45 - we still need more code
11:48 - so what happens when i miss
11:50 - nothing
11:52 - let's change the background to have a
11:54 - different color down here
11:56 - because then we'll be able to sense if
11:58 - the ball missed the paddle and hit that
12:00 - color
12:05 - we'll go to a gray color
12:09 - we'll just draw a rectangle
12:13 - let's get it way down so you can barely
12:15 - see it
12:16 - go back to the code for the ball
12:24 - and have another condition
12:29 - ball if you're touching that gray color
12:33 - i gotta pick the gray color
12:42 - then broadcast
12:45 - game
12:50 - over and then stop this forever loop
13:01 - all right it worked it stopped the game
13:03 - we could add the code so we could have
13:04 - three lives but let's just leave it at
13:06 - one for now
13:09 - let's go back to the code for the bricks
13:12 - i need a forever loop for the bricks
13:14 - that it just keeps checking to see if
13:16 - it's touching the ball
13:21 - because when it gets hit by the ball it
13:23 - needs to disappear
13:25 - we need an if inside the forever loop
13:29 - so forever
13:31 - if you're touching the ball
13:35 - then hide
13:40 - and delete yourself
13:50 - it works they're disappearing
13:53 - i wish i could get it to go above the
13:55 - top row and just start bouncing around
14:02 - oh and i love it when that happens
14:04 - they just
14:05 - start bouncing around and i just keep
14:07 - racking up the points speaking of points
14:09 - we don't have any points let's get a
14:11 - score
14:14 - we're going to make a variable and call
14:16 - it score
14:20 - when the game first starts
14:22 - score is zero
14:24 - and every time we break a brick
14:30 - we want to add one to the score
14:33 - i need to add another if statement here
14:36 - if the score is ever
14:39 - so much that it means he broke all the
14:41 - bricks then we need to say that he won
14:44 - he won the game
14:45 - you could go on to a new level or
14:46 - something but i'm just going to say that
14:48 - he won the game if he clears the screen
14:50 - one time
14:51 - i need to add the code if score is
14:54 - greater than a certain amount
14:59 - so if we've got 16 across
15:03 - and we've got six rows
15:06 - that's 96
15:08 - so we're going to have 96 bricks
15:11 - so if the score is greater than 95
15:13 - that means he won
15:15 - i need to broadcast
15:18 - that he won
15:19 - i'll just say win message
15:23 - if i leave it like this there's going to
15:25 - be a brick left at the end
15:28 - i want him to hide
15:30 - before we say he won or that last brick
15:32 - will still be there
15:37 - instead of starting with the green flag
15:39 - let's add a start button
15:47 - and i'll just write the word start on a
15:49 - button that they already have
15:52 - next we're going to need a sprite to
15:54 - show whenever they win the game and
15:56 - another sprite to show whenever they
15:58 - lose the game
16:02 - so i'll create some text
16:05 - and say game over
16:09 - i want to make that red
16:13 - and then put some yellow highlight on it
16:20 - that looks good
16:27 - i need to right click that sprite and
16:29 - make a copy duplicate it
16:36 - and make that say winner
16:45 - so the winner sprite
16:47 - the code for that
16:50 - when the green flag is clicked
16:53 - he'll hide
16:55 - but when he receives the message win
16:56 - message
17:01 - then he'll show
17:03 - the game over message is just the
17:04 - opposite i'm going to drag the code over
17:06 - from
17:07 - from the winning message
17:10 - so when the green flag is clicked he's
17:12 - going to hide
17:14 - but whenever he receives the message
17:16 - that the game's over then he'll show
17:22 - so the game over message works we've got
17:24 - to get the start button working
17:28 - so this ball doesn't need to move until
17:30 - we click start
17:39 - when the green flag is clicked
17:42 - the start button needs to show
17:49 - and when the start button is clicked
17:52 - he needs to broadcast the message
17:58 - start pressed
18:05 - and then he needs to hide and just get
18:06 - out of the way
18:12 - now we've got to tell the ball to wait
18:14 - for the start press
18:17 - so this whole forever loop
18:21 - needs to be when the start's pressed
18:24 - when space no
18:26 - when i receive start press that's it
18:31 - and whenever
18:33 - the game is won when he receives the
18:36 - message win message
18:37 - the ball needs to stop bouncing around
18:43 - so stop all the other scripts in this
18:45 - sprite
18:48 - so the ball is just waiting on us now
18:54 - what do you think of the speed
19:05 - and hitting the middle of the paddle
19:06 - makes it go straight up that's good
19:12 - if i hit the left it goes left
19:15 - it's perfect
19:16 - we could add some code
19:18 - to where at the beginning of the game
19:20 - you could say how hard you want the game
19:21 - to be and make the paddle bigger or
19:23 - smaller
19:24 - or make the ball go faster or slower
19:27 - depending on how hard the
19:29 - player wanted the game to be
19:32 - let's give it a sound for when the ball
19:33 - hits the brick
19:36 - it's going to be in here whenever it's
19:37 - touching the ball
19:39 - and the brick disappears
19:42 - let's make it make a sound
19:44 - if we go to our sounds
19:49 - that's all we have we have to add a new
19:51 - sound
19:53 - i'm going to grab this
19:56 - boop bang thing
20:04 - i want to grab just one of these sounds
20:13 - and once i have what i want i just copy
20:15 - it to a new sound
20:17 - and that's the sound that i want and
20:20 - i'll rename that sound
20:23 - just bop
20:26 - let's see what it sounds like
20:28 - if we do that every time we hit a brick
20:33 - what we need
20:36 - is to play the sound bop
20:39 - in that if loop if it's touching the
20:41 - ball
20:43 - but we need to hide it before we play
20:45 - the sound
20:47 - it's hard to get these blocks exactly
20:49 - where you want them
20:52 - all right i got my sound turned on
20:56 - i wanted you to be able to hear that
20:58 - sound that i added
21:01 - it really adds to the game
