00:01 - welcome to scratch coding this is a
00:04 - series of videos to help you learn to
00:06 - code using scratch with scratch you can
00:10 - create your own stories puzzles and
00:13 - games and whatever else you want to
00:15 - create you're in control of everything
00:18 - in the programs that you write
00:20 - create a free account at scratch.mit.edu
00:25 - so you can do coding with us
00:28 - today you'll be creating a maze game
00:33 - [Music]
00:52 - you'll be able to navigate your
00:53 - character through the maze using your
00:55 - arrow keys
00:58 - before we create the maze i just want to
01:00 - show you that i added these arrows on my
01:02 - screen just so you can tell when i press
01:05 - my up arrow
01:07 - or right
01:08 - or down or left
01:11 - you do not need these you do not need
01:13 - the code
01:14 - see all the code that it takes to do
01:16 - that you won't need that but you will
01:18 - need a background
01:21 - to create a new background we could try
01:23 - to choose one
01:26 - but none of these will really work well
01:28 - for a maze
01:29 - so let's draw our own
01:33 - when you look at the backdrops this one
01:36 - that looks like stars will just give you
01:38 - a random backdrop you don't know what it
01:39 - is
01:40 - if you took a picture or got a picture
01:42 - from somewhere you could bring that
01:44 - picture in using the upload backdrop
01:47 - but to draw your own we go to paint i'm
01:49 - going to make it a little smaller so i
01:51 - can see the whole thing and you could
01:53 - get the paint brush and just draw on
01:55 - here something that you needed to go
01:57 - around
01:58 - but i'm going to just draw some
01:59 - rectangles i don't want a black outline
02:04 - i just want to fill my rectangles in
02:07 - with
02:08 - let's go with a green color
02:16 - so this is the edge
02:30 - i'll make my character come in over here
02:32 - and go out over there
02:33 - so i'm going to close in the whole rest
02:35 - of it
02:45 - put something in the way
02:50 - you can make this as complicated as you
02:52 - want
02:53 - but that's not really necessary
03:05 - i'm going to start off on a red color
03:18 - and end on a blue color
03:24 - the only important part about drawing
03:26 - your maze is that your walls are a
03:28 - different color
03:29 - than your finish line
03:33 - now let's pick a character
03:39 - let's make the crab smaller so he'll fit
03:41 - through the maze
03:50 - and he doesn't have any code so you'll
03:52 - see when i hit the arrows it doesn't
03:54 - make him do anything
03:58 - so when i hit the right arrow
04:00 - i want him to move right
04:03 - pushing the right arrow is an event
04:08 - so i can change when
04:10 - space key is pressed i can change that
04:12 - to when right arrow is pressed
04:14 - so when the right arrow is pressed
04:24 - i want to change his x location
04:28 - let's see what 10 does let's see if
04:29 - that's too much
04:40 - that's not too much
04:42 - i need an event for all four keys
04:46 - let me pull three more over
04:58 - when left arrow is pressed
05:00 - i want to change the x by a negative 10.
05:04 - instead of 10 to the right it'll go 10
05:06 - to the left
05:14 - when down arrow is pressed
05:18 - i want to change y
05:21 - by a negative 10.
05:28 - and when up is pressed i want to change
05:30 - y by a positive 10.
05:34 - we'll see how that looks
05:49 - yeah he made it through the maze
05:53 - when you're creating your game think
05:55 - about what you want it to do what you
05:57 - want it to say
05:58 - and add as much code as you want
06:02 - i want mine
06:03 - to say i won when he touches something
06:05 - blue when he touches that finish line
06:08 - so touching blue you would think would
06:10 - be an event
06:12 - but it's not the crab is gonna sense
06:14 - that he's touching blue so let me look
06:16 - in sensing
06:19 - when touching a certain color
06:23 - and to change the color to blue click on
06:25 - the color
06:26 - and then get this little dropper
06:29 - and then you just suck up some blue
06:31 - paint
06:32 - and it changes it to when touching the
06:34 - color blue
06:36 - but we have to get the code
06:38 - to find out if he's touching the color
06:40 - blue
06:47 - so if he's touching the color blue
06:58 - i want him to say
07:01 - i win
07:05 - how do we get that code to run
07:08 - because right now he's not touching the
07:09 - color blue if i run the code
07:12 - it'll just check one time and that's it
07:14 - so i've got to get it to continually
07:16 - keep checking
07:17 - for if he's touching the color blue
07:21 - we'll put that in a forever loop
07:26 - we have to have the if inside the
07:28 - forever
07:34 - so when the green flag is clicked
07:38 - it's going to continuously check to see
07:39 - if he's touching blue
07:42 - and if he is he's going to say he wins
07:49 - it worked
07:51 - now another thing i wanted to do
07:53 - if he touches the wall
07:55 - i want him to have to start over
07:58 - so where is he
08:00 - when he's right there
08:05 - he's at 169 106.
08:09 - so at the beginning of the game i want
08:11 - him to go to that starting spot and i
08:13 - also want him to do that if he touches
08:16 - the color green
08:19 - let me get another if
08:34 - if he senses
08:40 - he's touching the color green
08:41 - let me suck up some green paint
08:47 - if he senses that he's touching the
08:48 - color green he's going to go back to
08:50 - that
08:52 - spot it was not updating my blocks
08:59 - when i dragged to the beginning
09:02 - this 169 106
09:05 - was not the right location
09:11 - but now
09:12 - my starting position is really
09:15 - 181 negative 181 113
09:34 - so when i first hit the green flag i
09:35 - wanted to go to this beginning spot or
09:37 - if he touches the green wall i want him
09:39 - to go to this beginning spot
09:44 - it works
09:49 - so if he goes down
09:51 - and over
09:55 - oh almost touch the green
09:57 - and he makes it to the blue he says i
09:59 - win
10:01 - i'm going to add another sprite
10:08 - and pick tatiana
10:09 - because we're looking at her from above
10:15 - i'm going to go to my crab and copy all
10:18 - the code from the crab to tatiana
10:23 - just by dragging it and letting it go
10:36 - now when i go to tatiana
10:42 - all my code's jumbled up but it's all
10:44 - here
10:50 - let's make her smaller
10:56 - i'm going to go to the crab
10:59 - and just hide it
11:01 - right there it's got show
11:03 - and this will hide it
11:06 - i want to focus on tatiana right now
11:10 - if i want to make tatiana move to the
11:12 - right i hit the right key
11:15 - and down
11:18 - right up
11:23 - and she'll say i win
11:26 - but since we can see her from above
11:28 - i want to make her turn
11:32 - so when i hit the right key instead of
11:34 - her going right i want her to turn to
11:36 - the right
11:38 - this is a completely different way of
11:40 - using the keys to play this game
11:46 - when i hit the up arrow i want her to go
11:48 - forward
11:50 - so i'm not going to change y actually
11:52 - let's just get rid of change y
11:54 - change at y change x change x
11:58 - we're not going to change x or y
12:01 - when you push up you want her to go
12:02 - forward whichever direction she's
12:04 - pointing
12:06 - so she'll move 10 steps
12:10 - when she goes down
12:13 - she'll move a minus 10 steps
12:17 - it's just a different way of moving your
12:19 - character
12:21 - it's your game
12:22 - you're writing the program you can do it
12:24 - any way you want when i press the left
12:26 - arrow
12:28 - tatiana is going to turn left when i
12:31 - press the right
12:34 - she'll turn right let's see how that
12:36 - goes
12:59 - i win
13:01 - now it's your turn
13:03 - if you can create a character that goes
13:05 - through your maze using the arrow keys
