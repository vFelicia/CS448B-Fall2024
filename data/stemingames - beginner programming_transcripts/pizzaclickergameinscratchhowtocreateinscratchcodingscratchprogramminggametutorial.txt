00:01 - welcome to scratch coding with scratch
00:04 - you can create your own stories puzzles
00:06 - games and whatever else you want to
00:08 - create
00:09 - you're in control of everything and the
00:11 - programs that you write
00:14 - today we're going to make a pizza
00:16 - clicker game
00:17 - every time you click it makes a new
00:19 - pizza
00:22 - when you have at least 50 pizzas you'll
00:25 - be able to buy some sauce
00:27 - and when you buy the sauce
00:29 - then every time you click
00:31 - you'll get two pizzas for every click
00:34 - so it'll be even faster before you'll be
00:36 - able to buy some more sauce
00:38 - and you just keep clicking this is why
00:40 - it's called a clicker game because you
00:42 - just click
00:46 - and just keep buying enough sauce
00:49 - so that every time you click you're
00:51 - getting five
00:55 - now i'm getting eight every time i click
01:07 - and when you can afford it you can buy
01:09 - some cheese
01:12 - once you buy the cheese you'll be
01:14 - getting one pizza every second pps is
01:17 - pizzas per second
01:19 - even without clicking you get a pizza
01:21 - every second
01:24 - then when you can afford it you can add
01:26 - some peppers to your pizza and that's
01:28 - going to give me 10 more pizzas for
01:31 - every click
01:32 - it cost me 500 pizzas though
01:36 - i'll get some more
01:38 - peppers so now every time i click i'm
01:41 - getting 54 pizzas
01:46 - when you're ready and you can afford it
01:48 - you could put some olives on the pizza
01:50 - it'll cost you 2 000 pizzas but then
01:53 - you're getting a thousand more pizzas
01:55 - per second
01:57 - definitely a good investment
02:00 - it's surprising how fun a clicker game
02:03 - is
02:07 - load it up with some olives
02:09 - so that you'll be getting 30 000 pizzas
02:12 - per second
02:14 - then you can afford some tomatoes
02:16 - which will end up getting you a thousand
02:19 - more pizzas per click
02:22 - and when you have at least a a million
02:25 - pizzas saved up
02:27 - then you could buy some pepperoni
02:29 - i want some more peppers just for
02:31 - decoration
02:33 - i need to be able to afford some more
02:34 - pepperoni and that's how we play our
02:37 - pizza clicker game let's see how to
02:39 - write the code
02:40 - i hope you learned something helpful and
02:43 - enjoy watching give me a thumbs up and
02:45 - subscribe below
02:48 - we're going to start off today with the
02:49 - pizza clicker resources this is just the
02:52 - sprites
02:53 - there's a link to this below in the
02:55 - video description
02:56 - the resources includes all the drawings
02:59 - that we need all the sprites that we
03:01 - need to create this game
03:03 - of course if you want to draw your own
03:05 - olives or if you want to draw sausage or
03:08 - anything else you can do that but this
03:09 - will just save us some time
03:11 - the first thing i want to do is get a
03:13 - background
03:16 - i'll select upload backdrop
03:19 - and pick this tablecloth
03:24 - and earlier i found this tablecloth
03:26 - picture on the internet
03:30 - i'll convert it to vector
03:32 - and resize it
03:35 - and that'll be my background
03:40 - i don't need this one anymore
03:42 - i'm going to put a lot of the code that
03:44 - we need in the code for the dough
03:48 - you'll see i've provided a picture of
03:49 - the dough
03:51 - but there's no code yet
03:57 - first let's make it show on the screen
04:00 - that's probably a pretty good size
04:06 - when the green flag is clicked let's
04:07 - make sure that it shows
04:09 - that's probably a good spot for it too
04:11 - in case we accidentally drag it around
04:13 - somewhere let's make it go back to that
04:15 - same spot when we start the game
04:19 - in my original game whenever we clicked
04:22 - it made the dough grow and shrink so
04:24 - let's let's put that effect on it
04:28 - forever it's going to check
04:32 - and if the mouse is down
04:34 - it's going to change the dose size
04:37 - so mouse down is sensing
04:40 - if it senses that the mouse is down
04:45 - it's going to change the size
04:48 - by 5
04:50 - and then it'll change the back the size
04:52 - back down
04:54 - to the same as it was before
04:58 - but that will happen too fast so we need
05:00 - a little bit of time in between there
05:06 - not a whole second let's wait
05:08 - point one of a second
05:13 - that works
05:14 - now we want to be able to to get some
05:16 - points some money some pizzas i like to
05:19 - call it pizzas we want to get pizzas
05:21 - every time we click so we're going to
05:23 - need a variable
05:25 - make a variable
05:28 - and call it pizzas
05:31 - and if the mouse is down
05:34 - we're going to change pizzas by 1.
05:41 - but if they hold the mouse down they
05:43 - keep getting points so we can't let them
05:45 - cheat like that
05:46 - after the mouse is down
05:48 - then this loop needs to wait until the
05:50 - mouse is not down
05:55 - so now if i hold the mouse down it
05:57 - doesn't give them extra points they have
05:59 - to actually click every time they want
06:00 - to point
06:02 - i have another sprite down here called
06:04 - tiny pizza i used this picture of a
06:07 - pizza to make a pizza fly out every time
06:10 - you click a pizza flies out
06:13 - so that's what we use tiny pizza for
06:16 - so we're not gonna actually show tiny
06:18 - pizza we're going to show a clone of
06:20 - tiny pizza
06:21 - we go back to the code for the dough
06:25 - every time they click the mouse
06:31 - we're going to create a clone
06:34 - of tiny pizza
06:36 - let's go to the code for tiny pizza
06:38 - let's see what it looks like there he is
06:43 - so what's a good size for him was 15
06:46 - good
06:50 - that's a good size for tiny pizza
06:54 - so when the green flag is clicked
06:58 - we're going to set his size
07:00 - to 15
07:04 - and we're gonna make sure
07:06 - that he's hidden
07:10 - but
07:10 - if he's a clone if he starts as a clone
07:14 - then we want him to show but we don't
07:16 - want him to be really bright like this
07:19 - and to make him kind of faded out we're
07:20 - going to use the ghost effect
07:26 - so it's just going to be faded out about
07:28 - 40 percent we want him to start off in
07:30 - the middle of the screen
07:34 - that'll be zero zero for our x and y and
07:37 - we want him to just fly out across the
07:40 - screen
07:41 - so to do that we're going to make him
07:42 - move
07:44 - so just move 10 steps at a time
07:48 - we've got to get that to repeat a bunch
07:50 - of times
07:56 - so more than 10 let's make that 30.
08:01 - and he'll just fly across the screen we
08:03 - don't want him to go in the same
08:04 - direction every time
08:07 - let's make him point in a random
08:08 - direction when he first starts off
08:12 - and if it's any direction all the way
08:14 - around just a random number
08:16 - that's going to be between
08:18 - 1 and
08:19 - 360.
08:22 - so that time he went up that time he
08:24 - went he's going every different
08:25 - direction starting from the middle
08:28 - that's working pretty good
08:31 - we'll have some pizzas accumulating on
08:33 - the side though so we need to get rid of
08:35 - those
08:36 - so as he's moving across the screen
08:38 - moving 10 steps at a time when he gets
08:40 - to the edge i want him to get deleted
08:45 - so we have to get him to if
08:47 - touching the edge touching is going to
08:49 - be sensing because he'll sense that he's
08:50 - touching the edge
08:56 - he's just going to delete himself so we
08:58 - have to pick delete this clone
09:02 - now they disappear when they get to the
09:04 - edge
09:08 - and our pizzas are accumulating up there
09:13 - it's all working good so far
09:15 - let's go back to the code for our dough
09:19 - even when we hit the green flag it
09:21 - doesn't reset our pizzas
09:23 - we want our pizza variable to start off
09:25 - at zero when we start the game
09:28 - so go to our variables
09:31 - when the green flag is clicked
09:33 - we want to set pizzas to 0.
09:37 - we need a couple more variables
09:42 - i want to have ppc which stands for
09:45 - pizzas per click
09:49 - and pps which stands for pizzas per
09:51 - second pizzas per second is going to be
09:54 - zero when it starts
09:59 - and pizzas per click will be one when it
10:01 - starts so they're not getting any pizzas
10:04 - every second when they start but they do
10:06 - get a pizza every click
10:09 - and every time we click
10:11 - right now pizzas per click is one
10:14 - and this is one so it doesn't matter
10:17 - but when pizzas per click is more than
10:19 - one
10:22 - we're going to want to get that many
10:23 - every time we click
10:26 - ok so it still works
10:28 - if we change pizzas per click to 10 then
10:30 - we would get 10 pizzas every click
10:33 - if we change pizzas per second
10:36 - to a thousand
10:38 - nothing happens because we didn't write
10:39 - the code for that yet
10:42 - we need every second to increase the
10:45 - pizzas by pizzas per second
10:49 - that whole process is going to start
10:51 - when the green flag clicks
10:53 - we need it in a forever loop
10:59 - and what we want to do
11:03 - is change our number of pizzas
11:05 - by however many pizzas per second we're
11:08 - supposed to be earning
11:09 - but we can't just run that
11:11 - it's way too fast we're going to make it
11:13 - wait for a second
11:15 - in between there
11:20 - so now we're getting a thousand pizzas
11:22 - every second
11:26 - all right that looks good let's change
11:28 - pizzas per click back to one
11:30 - and pizzas per second back to zero
11:33 - that's the way the game is going to
11:34 - start and let's give our players
11:37 - some stuff to buy
11:39 - the first thing we're going to want them
11:40 - to be able to put on the pizza is the
11:42 - sauce
11:46 - this isn't actually the sauce this is
11:48 - just a little picture that goes up here
11:50 - that lets them buy some sauce
11:53 - and the way i created this
11:55 - was the little graphic image here with a
11:57 - outline
11:58 - and then just three different lines of
12:00 - text you can do text just by clicking on
12:02 - the text and typing
12:05 - you can change the size of
12:08 - it just by dragging it bigger or smaller
12:12 - you could change these prices if you
12:13 - want
12:15 - so the code for the sauce
12:17 - first off i need to make it show up
12:21 - and that actually might be a good place
12:23 - for it
12:28 - when the green flag is clicked i'll tell
12:30 - it to go right there
12:32 - and if somebody clicks that sprite
12:35 - they're going to want to buy some sauce
12:37 - to put on the pizza but if they don't
12:39 - have at least 50 to spend then they
12:42 - can't buy it so we need to check
12:45 - we need an if then
12:47 - get an operator
12:49 - and look at our variable pizzas
12:53 - if pizzas is greater than 50 then they
12:56 - can afford it and we're going to let the
12:58 - other sauce know that it needs to show
13:00 - up we're going to do that
13:04 - by broadcasting the message show sauce
13:10 - and so when they show the sauce then it
13:11 - cost them 50 pizzas
13:14 - so i have to change that variable
13:20 - change it by minus 50 which means we're
13:22 - just subtracting 50
13:24 - and what booster did they buy when they
13:26 - bought the sauce then they get an extra
13:28 - point per click so we need to change
13:30 - that
13:32 - we need to change points per click
13:36 - by one it's just going to increase it by
13:37 - one so when the green flag is clicked
13:40 - you get credit for the clicks but you
13:43 - don't actually get to buy any sauce
13:45 - until we have 50.
13:50 - once we were able to buy the sauce then
13:52 - we're getting two points per click
13:56 - it's working perfect now we got to make
13:58 - the sauce show up i have another picture
14:00 - down here for you
14:02 - if you get this out of the resources
14:04 - that's the pizza sauce
14:08 - and remember in here we broadcasted show
14:10 - sauce
14:13 - so in this pizza sauce
14:17 - receives the message show sauce
14:23 - then it's gonna show how easy is that
14:27 - we need to make sure it shows up in the
14:29 - right place though
14:31 - it's back behind there
14:33 - so not only in the right place but also
14:35 - on top
14:37 - let's go back to the code for the pizza
14:39 - sauce
14:41 - when the green flag is clicked
14:48 - he's going to hide
14:52 - but he's also going to go to the front
14:54 - so when you show him you'll be able to
14:56 - see him he'll be in front of the dough
14:58 - i'm going to hit the green flag so my
15:00 - dough will go back to where it's
15:02 - supposed to be
15:03 - i'm going to show my sauce
15:05 - and that's in a good spot
15:08 - so in my motion
15:10 - i'll make him go to that
15:12 - xy position when the game starts so
15:15 - he'll be hidden but it'll be in the
15:16 - right place and that's all the code i
15:18 - need for my sauce
15:20 - if they end up buying more sauce it's
15:22 - just going to show another one right on
15:24 - top we're gonna do the exact same thing
15:26 - for the cheese
15:28 - we have a picture of the cheese
15:30 - right here in the costumes that has the
15:32 - words next to it that says how much it
15:34 - costs
15:35 - and that that's gonna increase your
15:37 - pizzas per second by one
15:39 - that code is going to be a lot like the
15:41 - sauce code
15:44 - so we'll just copy it
15:46 - i'm going to drag this
15:49 - to my cheese sprite
15:51 - and drag this one
15:54 - now i'll go to my cheese
15:58 - and let me make him show
16:02 - so instead of going to minus 207 100
16:05 - let's make him go to -209 444
16:13 - and he costs a hundred
16:15 - so if somebody wants to buy this we got
16:17 - to make sure they have at least a
16:18 - hundred already
16:20 - and we're going to broadcast
16:22 - show cheese
16:25 - we're going to take away 100 from them
16:29 - and we'll change pizzas per second by
16:31 - one
16:32 - that's it for the cheese
16:34 - let's go
16:35 - to the actual cheese that goes on the
16:37 - pizza
16:38 - we have no code but it's going to be
16:40 - really similar to the pizza sauce so
16:42 - let's copy that
16:48 - when he receives the message show cheese
16:51 - he's going to show
16:53 - and when the green flag is clicked
16:56 - he's going to hide
16:57 - he's going to go to the front layer and
16:59 - he's going to go to the right spot so
17:01 - for the sauce and the cheese it doesn't
17:03 - matter how many you have on there it's
17:05 - still going to look exactly the same
17:08 - but when you start buying tomatoes and
17:10 - olives and peppers that is a clone
17:14 - because you don't know how many peppers
17:16 - you're going to need or how many
17:17 - pepperonis you're going to need
17:19 - and so i made all of those clones let's
17:21 - look at peppers next let's make that
17:23 - show
17:24 - and let's also look at the costumes this
17:27 - first costume
17:29 - this is the one that shows up up here
17:31 - and peppers2 the second costume is the
17:34 - one that shows up on the pizza there's
17:35 - not two different sprites for it there's
17:37 - just two different costumes
17:39 - so the code for it
17:42 - when the game first starts
17:45 - let's make sure the size is right we'll
17:47 - change it to 35
17:53 - and go to where he is right now
18:01 - and set his costume to the first costume
18:04 - now this next part is similar to what we
18:06 - did for the sauce and the cheese
18:08 - we need to find out if they have enough
18:10 - money to buy it
18:12 - so if they try to buy it they click on
18:14 - it when this sprite is clicked we need
18:16 - to see if they have enough money
18:20 - it's going to be pizzas
18:22 - we need an operator
18:26 - if pizzas is greater than and the
18:28 - peppers are costing them 500.
18:31 - so we've got to make sure they have at
18:32 - least 500
18:34 - and if they do it's going to go in here
18:36 - and run this code
18:38 - so if they do have enough money
18:43 - we're going to take away 500
18:46 - change pizzas by negative 500
18:49 - we're going to give them 10 more pizzas
18:51 - per click
18:52 - so we'll change
18:55 - pizzas per click by 10
18:59 - and we need to create a clone of
19:02 - the peppers
19:04 - with that second costume
19:09 - for this we're just going to create a
19:11 - clone of myself
19:13 - and then the code that's going to run
19:15 - for that clone is when i start as a
19:17 - clone
19:21 - i need to be peppers 2.
19:25 - this costume
19:28 - we don't want it to show up behind the
19:31 - cheese
19:32 - so we'll tell it to go to the front
19:34 - layer i don't have enough money
19:38 - i'm going to set
19:40 - just for testing here i'm going to set
19:43 - pizzas
19:46 - higher so i can buy some peppers
19:49 - okay so i bought some peppers but it
19:50 - looks like it's showing my peppers right
19:52 - here so that's not good
19:54 - so when he starts as a clone he needs to
19:56 - show up over here
19:58 - somewhere on the pizza let's have it
20:01 - from about
20:02 - 0
20:04 - to 180
20:06 - for the x
20:08 - and minus 100
20:10 - to 100 for the y
20:14 - so we got to tell it to go to a random
20:16 - position
20:17 - somewhere on this doe or it's going to
20:20 - be on the cheese really
20:25 - when he starts at a as a clone he's
20:27 - going to go to a random x y position
20:30 - we'll start with the x between 0 and 180
20:33 - and the y between negative 100 and
20:35 - positive 100
20:42 - so if we put on some sauce and then we
20:44 - put on some cheese
20:45 - and we put some peppers oh that one's
20:49 - that one's way off
20:51 - we can make y smaller let's change it to
20:54 - 80.
20:56 - that's a lot better they're still a
20:58 - little messy but that's close enough are
21:00 - we getting 10 more pizzas per click
21:01 - every time we got 482
21:04 - 492. everything's working perfect now
21:07 - the next thing we have is the olives are
21:09 - we done with this code
21:11 - we want to make sure we have it right
21:13 - before we start copying it somewhere
21:14 - else we'll have to change things in
21:16 - multiple places i think it looks good
21:19 - so we've got to copy all three of these
21:22 - to our olives
21:26 - go to the code for the olives
21:30 - when he starts as a clone
21:33 - he's going to change
21:35 - his costume to olives 2 go to the front
21:38 - layer
21:39 - that random position should be pretty
21:41 - close
21:44 - we need to show him as olives
21:57 - i think maybe 30 would be better
22:02 - make sure he starts off in the right
22:03 - place
22:08 - and then whenever somebody tries to buy
22:10 - him they have to have at least two
22:12 - thousand
22:14 - and it's gonna cost them two thousand
22:19 - but then their pizzas per second
22:23 - goes up by a thousand
22:27 - and they create a clone of themself
22:30 - and the clone is gonna show up over
22:31 - there
22:34 - so we gotta go
22:36 - back to the peppers and get us some
22:37 - money
22:41 - oh that's too big
22:43 - we'll make them a lot smaller
22:50 - that's a lot smaller
22:52 - let's get some money
22:56 - some sauce and some cheese
22:58 - and that looks good
23:02 - yeah we just need to add a couple more
23:04 - things do the same thing for the
23:06 - tomatoes and the pepperoni
23:11 - you can create as many ingredients as
23:13 - you want and just copy that same code to
23:16 - all the ingredients
23:18 - in each ingredient you just have to put
23:20 - it in the right place charge the right
23:22 - amount of pizzas
23:24 - and then increase the pizzas per click
23:26 - or the pizzas per second
23:28 - you can change the sprites to be
23:30 - anything that you want you could change
23:32 - the picture to be sausage instead of
23:34 - tomato
23:37 - you can change the words and the cost or
23:39 - anything you want just change the code
23:40 - to match whatever you say you're
23:42 - charging
23:46 - and that's how you create a pizza
23:48 - clicker game
23:52 - now we have sausage and pepperoni we can
23:54 - make a meat lover's pizza
