00:01 - welcome to scratch coding this is a
00:04 - series of videos to help you learn to
00:06 - code using scratch with scratch you can
00:10 - create your own stories puzzles and
00:13 - games and whatever else you want to
00:15 - create you're in control of everything
00:18 - in the programs that you write
00:20 - create a free account at scratch.mit.edu
00:25 - so you can do coding with us
00:27 - today we're going to make a character
00:30 - jump
00:30 - like this
00:45 - you already know to make a character go
00:47 - up
00:48 - you increase y
00:52 - see how it's changing here
00:54 - and to make it go down
00:58 - you decrease y
01:00 - so one might think that the code
01:06 - to make y go to 120
01:09 - and then to make y go to minus 120 would
01:12 - make it jump
01:13 - let's see i'm going to press 1 on my
01:16 - keyboard
01:18 - so that changed y to where he was up at
01:21 - the 120 position
01:24 - and then he went back down to the minus
01:26 - 120 position
01:30 - that does not look like a real jump
01:34 - let's try making him glide when i press
01:37 - two he's gonna glide up for .7 seconds
01:41 - he'll glide up to the y position six
01:45 - and then he'll glide back down
01:47 - to the y position minus 114. let's see
01:50 - what that looks like
01:57 - that's better than this one
02:00 - but it still doesn't look like a real
02:01 - jump
02:04 - let's try
02:07 - when i press
02:08 - 3 on my keyboard
02:11 - we're going to do a loop
02:17 - this loop
02:19 - he'll go up by 8 15 times
02:24 - and then this loop he'll go down by 8 15
02:27 - times let's see what that looks like
02:31 - that looks a lot like the glide doesn't
02:33 - it
02:38 - before we look at option four
02:41 - let's think more about what happens when
02:43 - you jump up
02:45 - or if you throw a ball up
02:48 - if you throw a ball up it's going really
02:51 - fast in the beginning and then as it
02:53 - goes up it slows down and slows down and
02:56 - slows down gravity is making it slow
02:58 - down until it stops
03:00 - and then it
03:02 - comes back down it starts off going slow
03:05 - but then gravity makes it speed up speed
03:07 - up speed up until it comes back down so
03:09 - if we want to make a character jump and
03:11 - scratch we need to make the character
03:13 - start off fast when he jumps and then
03:15 - slow down till he stops and then as he
03:18 - falls back down he increases his speed
03:21 - so let's go back to scratch to see how
03:23 - to code that
03:24 - and that's what i've coded here for when
03:26 - i press key 4
03:30 - he starts off going faster he slows down
03:32 - until he stops
03:34 - and then he falls back down getting
03:35 - faster and faster as he falls down the
03:38 - speed that he's going
03:40 - i have a variable called y change
03:43 - and that shows you how fast he's going
03:45 - watch whenever i press it and he jumps
03:47 - up
03:48 - y change is going to go from 15 all the
03:51 - way down to 1 and then back up to a
03:53 - minus 15.
04:04 - so we're just going to start off
04:06 - anywhere on the screen it doesn't matter
04:09 - and i set my variable to 15
04:13 - and then in this loop it repeats 15
04:16 - times
04:17 - it makes him go up
04:18 - 15
04:20 - and then it changes my speed or y change
04:23 - to 14.
04:25 - then he goes up by 14
04:27 - and it changes my y by 14
04:30 - then 13 and it just keeps going in the
04:32 - loop
04:33 - until my y change or my speed is down to
04:37 - one
04:40 - then i have a loop to bring him back
04:41 - down
04:43 - in this loop
04:44 - we change y change by a negative one
04:47 - every time
04:48 - and then you change his y position by
04:51 - that amount he'll be going down minus
04:54 - one and then minus two minus three it
04:57 - just keeps repeating
05:02 - let's redo this code for another
05:04 - character
05:11 - let's make nano jump
05:20 - i could use y change but let's make a
05:22 - new variable
05:23 - because when you're doing this in your
05:25 - code you're going to have to start from
05:26 - the beginning
05:29 - let's call the variable speed
05:33 - so here's my variable speed
05:37 - we already know we're going to have to
05:38 - have a loop for him to go up
05:41 - and another loop for him to come down
05:43 - in my other code i used 15
05:45 - but it can be different that's not the
05:47 - important part let's just make it 20.
05:50 - as long as you also come back down 20.
05:54 - and you know on the way up you're going
05:56 - to be changing your y position
06:02 - and on the way back down you'll be
06:03 - changing your y position
06:05 - but instead of changing by 10 we want to
06:07 - change by speed
06:13 - normally i would start my code whenever
06:16 - the green flag is clicked or something
06:18 - else like that happens but i have a lot
06:20 - of other code running and so let's
06:22 - change it to when i press the up arrow
06:24 - it'll start my code
06:27 - let's make speed 20.
06:31 - since we're going to loop 20 times
06:34 - and in the loop
06:39 - we need to slow him down on the way up
06:47 - and then make him go faster coming back
06:49 - down notice that these are both negative
06:53 - if you start off
06:56 - with speed being 20 and you take away
06:58 - from it speed is going to get smaller
06:59 - and smaller
07:01 - as he goes up
07:03 - until it gets to zero so it'll go from
07:05 - 20 to zero
07:07 - on the way back down it's going to go
07:09 - from zero to minus 20. so you're still
07:13 - changing your speed by a minus one each
07:15 - time let's see how that looks
07:23 - he's not quite going all the way back
07:25 - down
07:30 - we need to change the y after
07:34 - we've taken one away
07:37 - let's try it now
07:41 - that's it that's a pretty good jump
07:44 - sometimes it's helpful to have this loop
07:46 - where he's going up
07:47 - to be separate from the loop that's
07:49 - coming down
07:51 - but really if this is repeated for 15
07:54 - and this one is repeated for 15
07:57 - and what we're doing inside there is
07:59 - changing y
08:00 - and subtracting 1 from our y change or
08:03 - from our speed
08:05 - we could just loop 30 times
08:08 - and get rid of this second loop
08:11 - the only thing we'll have to change y
08:12 - one more time
08:14 - after the loop
08:16 - and it'll end up being the same thing
08:20 - just makes it a little shorter
08:22 - that's the end of this lesson click like
08:25 - and subscribe below so i can keep making
08:28 - tutorials and more people can find them
08:31 - now it's your turn get a character and
08:33 - make them jump and make their speed
08:35 - change on the way up and down so it'll
08:36 - look realistic if you can make your
08:38 - character jump and change their speed
08:41 - then congratulations you've finished
