00:01 - welcome to scratch coding this is a
00:04 - series of videos to help you learn to
00:06 - code using scratch with scratch you can
00:10 - create your own stories puzzles and
00:13 - games and whatever else you want to
00:15 - create you're in control of everything
00:18 - in the programs that you write
00:20 - create a free account at scratch.mit.edu
00:25 - so you can do coding with us
00:28 - today we're going to create something
00:30 - like this
00:32 - tap the penguin
00:38 - it's a game when you tap the penguin it
00:41 - decorates your scene
00:44 - i got six points
00:46 - let's create a new project and see how
00:49 - to do it
00:52 - i'll remove scratch cat and pick a new
00:55 - character
01:00 - i like the penguin
01:02 - to start let's make our penguin go to a
01:04 - random position
01:09 - let's make him do that
01:11 - ten times
01:18 - that happens way too fast
01:21 - so let's wait one second
01:24 - in between him moving around
01:30 - we're going to get a point every time we
01:33 - click on him
01:35 - so when this sprite is clicked
01:38 - we're going to score a point
01:42 - how do we keep track of how many points
01:44 - we have
01:45 - let's look at the orange blocks
01:47 - variables a variable is like a container
01:51 - for your programs
01:52 - you can use a variable to hold a number
01:55 - or some other information for you the
01:57 - most important thing about today's
01:59 - lesson is that you learn how to make a
02:02 - variable
02:03 - and use a variable
02:05 - variables are very important when you're
02:07 - coding let's make a variable to keep
02:09 - track of our score
02:13 - and we can simply call it score
02:16 - it doesn't really matter you can name it
02:17 - anything you want
02:19 - but to help make your code make sense
02:21 - it's good to use a name that reflects
02:23 - what it does
02:26 - now that we have a variable called score
02:29 - it's available for us to use
02:32 - the value of score is also on our screen
02:35 - now we can set our variable to whatever
02:38 - we want
02:40 - we can hide it we can show it
02:43 - but for our game
02:44 - what we want to do
02:46 - is change our variable by one every time
02:49 - the sprite is clicked
02:55 - you can see the scores going up
03:01 - at the beginning of our game
03:07 - we want to change the score to zero so
03:09 - you have to start over
03:11 - and start when the green flag is clicked
03:14 - let's see how that looks
03:31 - once he stops moving around i can still
03:33 - click on him
03:34 - and keep racking up the points
03:38 - so let's hide him when the game is over
03:42 - to be able to see him is the way he
03:44 - looks so let's look under the looks
03:46 - blocks
03:55 - i can't tell how long i have left and so
03:57 - i'm going to do a countdown let me make
03:59 - a new variable
04:02 - we'll call it time
04:10 - in the beginning
04:12 - we're going to set time to 10.
04:23 - and in the loop
04:24 - i'm going to count down
04:30 - on my time
04:32 - now i can see the score and the amount
04:35 - of time i have left let's see how that
04:37 - looks
04:45 - i need to unhide him
05:00 - show
05:03 - when i click the green flag i want him
05:05 - to show again
05:10 - and now my timer's counting down i can
05:12 - see how much time i have left
05:15 - and what my score is
05:21 - so that's the most important part of our
05:23 - game today
05:24 - the rest of it is just for fun let's
05:26 - pick a backdrop
05:32 - and some more sprites
05:46 - i only want my other sprites to show up
05:49 - once i have some points so i need to go
05:51 - to their code let's go to the code for
05:53 - the ball
05:58 - when the green flag is clicked
06:03 - i want them to hide
06:06 - but when my variable score
06:10 - i need an operator
06:15 - if my score is equal to one
06:23 - then i want him to show up again
06:35 - so when the green flag is clicked
06:37 - this code is going to check the score
06:39 - and see if it's one
06:41 - and then show
06:42 - our first ornament
06:45 - that's a problem because it's just going
06:47 - to do it once
06:49 - it's never going to check again so it'll
06:51 - never happen
06:55 - i'm going to have to make it check and
06:57 - then check again and check again and
06:58 - check again
07:01 - let's see if that works
07:08 - yeah it was gone
07:11 - until i got at least one point
07:15 - so i don't really need this
07:18 - other wind
07:20 - green flag clicked
07:22 - i can stick the hide right in there
07:25 - now i don't have any code yet for the
07:27 - sun
07:29 - the star or the gift
07:32 - but i can just go to the balls code
07:35 - and drag it and let it go on the gift
07:40 - drag it again let it go on the star
07:46 - and the same thing for the sun
07:48 - so now when i go and look
07:52 - the gift has code let's only get the
07:54 - gift when you get two points
07:59 - and a star when you get three
08:02 - in the sun when you get four
08:20 - i'm going to duplicate some more
08:21 - presents
08:27 - and change a couple of them's costumes
08:32 - and make this one you need five points
08:34 - to get this one
08:40 - duplicate the ornament a few times
08:55 - and get a polar bear
09:02 - he needs code
09:04 - and we don't get the polar bear
09:08 - we get eight points
09:09 - all right let's play it now
09:22 - we got everything
09:27 - if i wanted to make the game harder i
09:29 - could make the penguin a lot smaller
09:34 - change size to 50 instead of 100
09:37 - that's 50 percent
09:49 - i see a problem
09:52 - one last thing
09:54 - sometimes the penguin is behind the
09:56 - presents
09:57 - and we wouldn't be able to click on him
10:06 - we want him to go to the front
10:11 - back would be behind other stuff
10:14 - let's make him go to the front and see
10:16 - if that fixes it
10:29 - yes he's in front of the presence now
10:31 - and in front of the sun
10:33 - time's up
10:35 - our variables work our game works now
10:38 - it's your turn get a character
10:40 - make him go to 10 random positions
10:44 - and try to click on him go to the orange
10:46 - variables
10:49 - and click on make a variable so that you
10:51 - can keep score if you can create a game
10:54 - that when you click on your character
10:56 - you get points then congratulations
10:59 - you've mastered this lesson this free
11:01 - coding lesson was provided by stem games
11:04 - watch more lessons and keep practicing
11:06 - so you can create new worlds and games
11:09 - and make your ideas come to life i'll
11:12 - see you next time bye bye
