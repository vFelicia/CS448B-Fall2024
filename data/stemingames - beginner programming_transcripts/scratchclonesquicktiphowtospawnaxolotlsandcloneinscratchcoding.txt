00:01 - welcome scratchers today we're doing a
00:04 - quick tip about how to clone sprites
00:08 - many times in our games we need a lot of
00:10 - sprites
00:12 - and the best way to do that is with
00:14 - clones
00:15 - these are the three blocks that you'll
00:17 - need when creating a clone
00:20 - this starting block when i start as a
00:21 - clone
00:22 - all the code underneath that will tell
00:24 - your sprite what to do when he starts as
00:26 - a clone
00:27 - i'm on this yellow axolotl right now
00:30 - all this underneath here tells him what
00:32 - to do when he starts as a clone if i
00:35 - just click create clone of myself
00:38 - that will make this yellow axolotl
00:40 - create a clone of himself inside the
00:42 - code here it changes the color it's why
00:44 - it's blue
00:45 - and i can just click that as many times
00:47 - as i want
00:52 - inside my program
00:54 - the egg code
00:55 - says whenever i click the egg that's
00:57 - what creates the clone
01:00 - it's going to create a clone of whatever
01:02 - type i have selected
01:05 - let's start with something simpler
01:07 - so we just have some basic code to make
01:09 - this axolotl do something
01:13 - but instead of creating one when the
01:15 - green flag is clicked we want to do
01:17 - clones
01:20 - clones are under the control blocks
01:24 - and when i start as a clone i want to do
01:26 - all this
01:30 - just drag the code from when green flag
01:32 - clicked over to when i start as a clone
01:35 - and the way you start a clone
01:38 - is by creating a clone
01:41 - since the code is in with this purple
01:43 - axolotl
01:44 - it's going to be a clone of himself
01:47 - if we wanted it to be in
01:50 - another sprite
01:52 - we wouldn't have this
01:54 - egg
01:55 - axolotl egg create a clone of himself
01:58 - he's going to create a clone of the
02:00 - purple axolotl
02:05 - and there he created a clone i can click
02:08 - create another clone
02:13 - just create as many as i want
02:18 - when you get done with a clone you want
02:20 - to use the block delete this clone but
02:23 - in this case i'm not done with the
02:24 - axolotl so i'm not going to delete them
02:27 - we can just keep creating more
02:30 - let's look at some other examples
02:33 - in my full axolotl game
02:35 - you'll see that these axolotls have a
02:37 - lot of code when they start as a clone
02:46 - and the regular sprite stays hidden the
02:48 - whole time
02:53 - the clones are created in the code for
02:55 - the egg
02:57 - because when i click on the egg
02:59 - i want it to create a clone of the type
03:01 - of axolotl that you've selected
03:10 - in my pizza clicker game every time you
03:12 - click
03:13 - a tiny pizza clone flies out
03:23 - and that's in this code when i started a
03:25 - clone
03:26 - you can watch the full video for how to
03:28 - create this pizza clicker game but
03:31 - creating the clone is hidden in this
03:33 - dough code
03:37 - if the mouse is down
03:40 - it creates a clone of tiny pizza right
03:42 - here
03:50 - one more example is my breakout game
03:54 - all of these bricks are drawn by this
03:57 - one sprite they're all clones
04:00 - when he starts as a clone then he has
04:02 - all the code that he needs to be a clone
04:05 - when he gets hit by the ball he's going
04:06 - to disappear and delete this clone right
04:08 - here you'll see i have the code for
04:10 - delete the clone because once it gets
04:12 - hit by the ball it's not needed anymore
04:27 - even though there's not an infinite
04:28 - number of blocks that need to be created
04:30 - i still thought it was best to use clone
04:32 - for this
04:34 - so the way i did that
04:36 - six times because i'm going to need six
04:38 - rows i did a repeat loop
04:41 - and then 16 across
04:45 - so it creates a clone creates a clone
04:47 - creates a clone 16 times
04:50 - and then it goes to the next one
04:52 - does that 16 times goes to the next one
04:54 - and it does that six times
04:57 - so it's just
04:58 - a loop inside a loop
05:00 - and inside there it creates a clone of
05:02 - myself
05:06 - because there's so many blocks that need
05:08 - to be created
05:10 - in my tic tac toe game i could have used
05:13 - clones for this
05:14 - there's
05:15 - three across and three down so there's
05:17 - nine clones here of where the x's and
05:20 - o's can go and i've seen other
05:22 - programmers use clones to do that
05:25 - but i thought the best way to do that
05:27 - was to just have nine
05:29 - sprites
05:31 - so i didn't use clones to make the
05:33 - tic-tac-toe game
05:35 - i hope you've enjoyed this quick tip
05:37 - give me a thumbs up and subscribe below
05:40 - whenever you have to create a lot of
05:41 - characters remember to use these three
05:44 - coding blocks to clone your sprite i'll
05:46 - see you next time bye bye
