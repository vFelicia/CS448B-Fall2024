00:00 - this video is made possible by my game
00:02 - bomber play seven awesome games and help
00:04 - support the channel get the steam game
00:05 - bundle at unity code monkey comm slash
00:08 - game bug in this video we're going to
00:10 - look at the awesome top-down shooter I
00:11 - made in just seven days you can play it
00:14 - for yourself
00:14 - and here we're going to see how it was
00:16 - made a lot of the elements I used were
00:18 - completely made from scratch in previous
00:19 - tutorial videos let's begin
00:24 - [Music]
00:28 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:31 - and this channel is all about helping
00:32 - you learn how to make your own games
00:34 - with enough tutorials made by a
00:35 - professional indie game developer so if
00:37 - you find the video helpful consider
00:39 - subscribing alright so here let's check
00:41 - out the top-down shooter I made there's
00:43 - tons of elements and mechanics that were
00:45 - completely created from scratch in
00:46 - previous videos and put together in this
00:48 - nice mini game the game is very quick
00:51 - and fully playable in your browser so
00:52 - check the link in the description to
00:54 - play it for yourself the web page where
00:56 - you can play the game also has links to
00:57 - all the elements that are used in the
00:59 - game so you can go and see how they were
01:01 - built as always you can download the
01:03 - complete project files for this game
01:04 - from the website and if you watch the
01:06 - videos for each specific element you'll
01:08 - be able to easily understand how the
01:10 - game was made and also this video took a
01:12 - long time to make and it's a bit of a
01:14 - different format than usual so please
01:16 - don't let me know what you think of this
01:18 - type of content where I take a bunch of
01:20 - elements made in previous videos and
01:22 - make it into a complete game for example
01:24 - what other minigames would you like to
01:26 - see made like this maybe a survival
01:28 - crafting game maybe a city builder our
01:30 - management game something like that so
01:31 - let me know in the comments ok go ahead
01:34 - pause the video and play through the
01:36 - game check out all the mechanics and
01:37 - elements used and then come back here
01:39 - and continue alright so if you're back
01:42 - here I assume you've played through the
01:44 - game now as he saw it contains quite a
01:46 - bunch of interesting features if you've
01:48 - been following the channel for a while
01:49 - you will have recognized a bunch of
01:51 - different elements I always try to
01:52 - emphasize the value of writing clean
01:54 - reasonable code so am I going with this
01:56 - minigame is to show that in action the
01:59 - reason why I was able to create
02:00 - something this complex in just a few
02:02 - days isn't because I work 20 hours days
02:04 - but rather because I reused a ton of
02:06 - elements made previously and put them
02:09 - all together into a nice complete
02:10 - experience so we're here in the editor
02:12 - you can see an overview of how the game
02:14 - set up how it's built and all of the
02:16 - various scripts attached to all of the
02:18 - objects okay so let's play through the
02:20 - game and I'll talk about all of the
02:22 - different things that were used but
02:24 - before we do that this video is made
02:26 - possible by my game bundle playing
02:28 - awesome games and help support the
02:29 - channel by picking up the discounted
02:31 - bundle on the website it contains 7
02:33 - games in a variety of genres start off
02:35 - with some strategy in the survivor squad
02:37 - games control your group of survivors
02:40 - and make sure you cover every
02:41 - then get your controller out for some
02:43 - action with a bit of strategy in hyper
02:45 - lights quickly - around and demolish
02:47 - your enemies with a bunch of unique
02:49 - really cool abilities capture castles
02:51 - and outposts while recruiting allies and
02:53 - moshing enemy Knights then work your
02:55 - brain with some management games build
02:57 - up your village trained ninjas and send
02:59 - them out on missions to get gold in
03:01 - ninja Tycoon then set up a complex chain
03:04 - of resource gathering and process them
03:05 - to craft more complex objects and make a
03:07 - profit in blueprint a [ __ ] and then
03:10 - chill out by running your own game
03:11 - studio in the awesome game Corp TX by
03:14 - playing those games you won't be able to
03:16 - see what I'm teaching here in action and
03:17 - you'll help ensure these videos stay
03:19 - free for everyone so go to unity code
03:21 - marcom slash game bundle and pick up the
03:24 - discounted game bundle okay so here we
03:26 - are in the main menu which is you can
03:28 - see it's extremely basic now when I
03:30 - click on play it's going to load the
03:32 - game scene so first of all that one is
03:34 - using the scene manager that I covered
03:36 - in the unloading video and the buttons
03:38 - here have some nice behavior handled by
03:40 - the button class on the utilities so
03:42 - let's start and just like that we are
03:45 - transported into the game scene and here
03:48 - you can already see a bunch of elements
03:50 - already news
03:50 - first there's the cinematic bars which
03:52 - show up and then hide themselves then
03:54 - there's the camera phone system which is
03:56 - smoothly moving the camera to follow the
03:58 - player as well as the mouse position as
04:01 - I shoot you can see that there are some
04:03 - sounds playing those are handled by the
04:05 - sound manager okay now let's go through
04:08 - this door and enter our level and over
04:11 - here we start off with our two nice
04:12 - enemies I try to design the enemies to
04:15 - be simple but also unique so as you can
04:17 - see this one is a wrench and me so he's
04:20 - throwing some chickens and they have
04:22 - some very nice particles behind them and
04:24 - the projectile look great then over here
04:26 - we have the charger which charges
04:28 - towards the player and it feels really
04:29 - great when I can dodge them so now let's
04:32 - take care of them and as I shoot them
04:34 - and there you go charger and yep there
04:36 - you go now the enemies are also using
04:39 - pathfinding so when we go over here and
04:41 - take a grow from these and there you go
04:43 - now they are following me correctly
04:44 - following the path so that's C
04:45 - pathfinding and they also have some very
04:47 - nice damage pop-ups as you can see when
04:50 - I shoot them some nice damage pop ups
04:53 - and over here we have another enemy with
04:55 - some really cool design the shooting
04:57 - enemy as you can see there are these two
04:59 - lines merging together and when the
05:01 - angle between them is zero he fires and
05:04 - I get shot however if I dodge just
05:07 - before you can see that I can dodge it
05:08 - because I keep some invulnerability
05:10 - frames lost I'm dodging alright so let's
05:15 - take them out and then over here in the
05:17 - corner there's my nice second weapon so
05:20 - it's a very nice shotgun so when I shoot
05:24 - you can see a whole bunch of different
05:25 - effects first of all there's the weapon
05:28 - tracer rounds so you can visually see
05:31 - where you're shooting at then we have
05:34 - the ball jump particles as well as the
05:36 - enemy particles which were made in the
05:38 - mesh particle system video alright so
05:41 - let's keep going now here on this side
05:46 - you can see that the key that we need to
05:47 - grab in order to open up the door in
05:49 - there and in this room there is a really
05:51 - cool little script that I made to handle
05:53 - a battle so I might make this into a
05:55 - separate video since it's a very nice
05:57 - little system so as I touch the key the
05:59 - door won't close and some enemies won't
06:01 - spawn okay so let's go and there you go
06:04 - the door closes and the enemies get
06:05 - nicely spawned and there you don't look
06:07 - at that nice awesome to solve effect as
06:09 - they get spawned get most of that very
06:11 - nice so now let me take care of all
06:14 - these there you go they're fun wat and
06:17 - the Dodge works great so I can keep
06:21 - dodging them keep shooting them and
06:23 - almost there
06:33 - all right so there they go all right so
06:36 - we're safe and over here we are carrying
06:37 - our key so we can now go back into our
06:40 - nice door so this is where we're using
06:42 - the key door system we made previously
06:44 - this is now the second game that I've
06:46 - used this system you can also see it in
06:48 - action in the FPS game I made so as you
06:50 - can see in the UI I'm currently holding
06:52 - the blue key and here we have the pool
06:54 - door and as I approach it
06:56 - yep an animation plays and the door is
06:58 - now open all right so let's keep going
07:02 - and now over here we have a bunch more
07:05 - enemies there's a charger there's a nice
07:07 - range of enemy firing chickens and the
07:09 - particles will look really nice and on
07:11 - the enemies you can already see when
07:13 - they die they transform into a flowing
07:16 - body and flies away and fire some odd
07:18 - particles there we go very nice okay so
07:20 - over here is the red door and we need
07:22 - the red key so let's go all the way in
07:25 - here and then we have another nice enemy
07:28 - and it tries to hit and there you go
07:30 - take care of them and then here we have
07:32 - our nice third weapon so we have a rifle
07:35 - pick it up and there you go now this one
07:37 - fires a lot more a lot faster now here
07:40 - we have our key and again we have some
07:43 - more enemies being spawned with a very
07:44 - nice to solve effect so there you go
07:46 - take care of all of them and yep very
07:49 - nice weapon all right so far so good so
07:52 - now we can actually go back and open our
07:54 - nice red door so let's open the door go
08:04 - through it and heal up and there you go
08:06 - now we have the final door going into
08:08 - our final boss fight now if you've
08:11 - played the FPS game I made then this
08:13 - boss fight won't seem nicely familiar
08:15 - the main differences over here we have
08:17 - it in 2d instead of 3d and the main boss
08:20 - is actually a sentry gun turret which
08:22 - looks quite great so he's all the way in
08:24 - there I can't actually see him now the
08:26 - sentry gun was actually made a really
08:28 - long time ago for Survivor squad so go
08:30 - pick up the game bundle in order to play
08:32 - that game and now let's see if I can go
08:34 - through this boss fight and talk at the
08:36 - same time ok so as I approach him you'll
08:39 - see this door closed behind us and then
08:41 - some enemies won't start to be spawned
08:42 - and
08:43 - yep there's the enemy the door closes
08:45 - and now he starts shooting and some
08:47 - enemies won't start being spawned in
08:49 - here I can still dodge him and I can
08:51 - shoot him and there you go now he goes
08:52 - into the second stage so punch more
08:54 - enemies continue being spawned I gotta
08:56 - take care of them and dodge them and I
08:59 - gotta take out both of these shield
09:01 - transformers and using the Dodge is
09:04 - great for the invulnerability so keep
09:07 - dodging keep dodging and take it out and
09:10 - yep there we go now it's vulnerable
09:11 - again and also some very nice pump pop
09:14 - ups yep there you go okay so now with
09:17 - the turret venerable I can shoot it and
09:19 - they're gone are we going to the next
09:20 - stage with even more transformers and
09:23 - even more enemies being spawned so I
09:25 - constantly have to dodge everything and
09:27 - shoot them and this is very very hectic
09:29 - but also the mechanics all work
09:31 - correctly and very nice with each other
10:34 - all right so they're you he's almost
10:36 - done and keep shooting in there we go
10:39 - all the enemies get down and as you can
10:40 - see he dropped the Greinke and I picked
10:42 - it up immediately all right so just like
10:45 - that we defeat in our nice boss fight
10:46 - awesome so that was really intense but
10:48 - also a really great battle
10:50 - so now let's heal up and again another
10:52 - shader effect when we heal is the nice
10:54 - sprite tent and now with our nice green
10:57 - key I can go all the way up here and
10:59 - open up the nice green door in order to
11:00 - win the level so keep going over and
11:03 - over there we have our trophy and I go
11:05 - and I pick it up and there you go I've
11:07 - won the nice mini game so here you can
11:10 - see the cinematic bars showing up again
11:12 - as well as a nice zoom based on the
11:14 - camera system and an awesome animated
11:17 - outline effect made in shader graph all
11:19 - right so this is the nice mini game I've
11:21 - built these past few days as you can see
11:23 - it's pre complex or something made in
11:25 - such a short amount of time so the
11:27 - reason for that is simply due to the
11:28 - fact that a lot of these elements were
11:30 - made previously since the way we
11:32 - initially wrote them was using some nice
11:34 - clean code they were easy to adapt and
11:35 - add on to this project so I hope this
11:38 - serves as a great example as to why I
11:40 - should focus on writing clean reusable
11:42 - code now on the page where you play the
11:45 - game you can see links to all of the
11:46 - elements that I use here so if you want
11:49 - to see a specific element more in-depth
11:51 - then go check out those videos you can
11:53 - also download the complete project files
11:55 - for this game from the website and if
11:57 - you watch the videos for each specific
11:59 - element you'll be able to easily
12:00 - understand how the game works if there's
12:03 - a specific element you see in the game
12:04 - that I haven't
12:05 - let me know in the comments for example
12:07 - I'd like to do a video on the viral
12:09 - spawner system it's very simple but it's
12:11 - a nice design so I think it's something
12:13 - that can be applied to many other games
12:14 - and also this video to come on time to
12:17 - make and it's a bit different from my
12:18 - usual format so please let me know what
12:20 - you think do you like this format where
12:22 - I take a bunch of previously made
12:24 - elements and put them together into a
12:25 - complete game
12:26 - what other minigames would you like to
12:28 - see made like this maybe a survival
12:30 - crafting game maybe a city builder or
12:32 - management game let me know in the
12:33 - comments and if you did enjoy the video
12:36 - please hit the like button and share it
12:37 - with a friend that really helps out the
12:39 - channel a lot so thanks for watching and
12:42 - as always you can download the project
12:43 - comes in a tony's from unity karma calm
12:45 - subscribe to the channel for more Ginty
12:47 - tutorials post any questions in have in
