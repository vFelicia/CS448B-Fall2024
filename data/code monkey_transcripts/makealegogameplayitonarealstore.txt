00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here's your chance to make a game
00:03 - and have it be playable on a real
00:05 - physical lego store the lego team has
00:07 - actually been working with ent for quite
00:09 - a while now i covered the lego micro
00:11 - game when that came out and they have
00:12 - kept updating it and right now they have
00:14 - a contest running which is very
00:16 - interesting the goal is to make a game
00:18 - focused on just one button so that by
00:20 - itself is a pretty interesting
00:22 - limitation that will certainly lead to
00:23 - some very creative designs
00:25 - maybe just a single tap means jump maybe
00:27 - a double tap means a special attack
00:29 - maybe a hold means a special ability or
00:32 - maybe one tab just means doing one thing
00:34 - so a game like flappy bird or some of
00:36 - those block building games so it seems
00:38 - quite limiting but you can still do
00:40 - quite a lot of interesting ideas with
00:41 - that limitation and the winner will
00:42 - actually be playable on real physical
00:44 - lego stores in a really nice arcade
00:46 - cabinet and on top of that there's even
00:48 - more prizes you can win lego sets a unt
00:51 - pro license and two hundred dollars for
00:53 - the asses or the contest ends in
00:54 - november so you have a couple of ways to
00:56 - build something really interesting
00:58 - in total there's three categories you
01:00 - can make a game with the ninjago theme
01:02 - to help you with that there's a free
01:04 - add-on with lego ninjago assets the
01:06 - other category is any theme of your
01:08 - choice the only limitation is really no
01:10 - third-party ips and the final last
01:13 - category is build something solely with
01:15 - lego behavior breaks and no additional
01:17 - scripting
01:18 - if you haven't tried the lego micro game
01:20 - the behavior breaks are individual
01:21 - bricks where each does just a bit of
01:23 - simple logic like for example one of
01:25 - them moves a platform left and right
01:27 - another one fires bullets another one
01:29 - looks at an object and so on
01:31 - when i checked out the lego micro game
01:32 - quite a while ago that feature was
01:34 - definitely the most interesting part so
01:36 - those are the three categories you can
01:38 - participate in in order to open up the
01:40 - unlike micro game it's very simple you
01:42 - just open up unity hub then you're going
01:43 - to create a new project now for this one
01:45 - make sure you are using 2020.3 lts so if
01:49 - you have multiple versions click on the
01:50 - arrow and select 20.3 then down here
01:53 - just wait for it to unload the list of
01:54 - all of the available templates and when
01:56 - that happens you should be able to see
01:58 - the lego micro game so just select that
01:59 - give it a name and hit on create and up
02:02 - here is in lego micro game now if you
02:03 - want you can go through the micro game
02:05 - tournaments these are pretty nice it's a
02:07 - guided path showing you how unity works
02:09 - and how this specific micro game works
02:12 - so if you are a yinty beginner i would
02:14 - definitely recommend you get started
02:15 - with those tutorials or even if you're a
02:17 - more advanced user it can still be
02:19 - helpful to go through these to learn all
02:20 - the specific things on this micro game
02:22 - like the brick system the behavior
02:24 - breaks and so on and in this project
02:26 - there's also tons and tons of scenes so
02:28 - lots of demos to see how everything
02:30 - works for example here is the sandbox
02:32 - scene so just by itself we can already
02:34 - see quite a lot of behaviors over here
02:36 - so here's a really nice chat box saying
02:38 - a bunch of text
02:40 - then over here you've got a button you
02:41 - can interact with you can press it and
02:43 - do a bunch of things and there you go it
02:44 - spawns a nice little character and over
02:47 - there a vertical platform
02:49 - then something you can touch to trigger
02:50 - some logic then something firing some
02:52 - bullets
02:53 - another elevator you can interact with
02:55 - so as you can see tons of things and all
02:56 - of these they are primarily working
02:58 - based on the behavior bricks so i don't
03:00 - think there's any custom c sharp written
03:02 - in this scene at all
03:04 - as you can see just with those behavior
03:05 - breaks you can already do quite a lot of
03:07 - things then there's a bunch more demo
03:09 - scenes with some interesting minigames
03:11 - so in this one there's a nice little
03:13 - lego panda constantly firing some
03:15 - weapons and the weapons destroy the
03:16 - things and i gotta pick up these fruits
03:20 - there you go lots of interesting
03:21 - interaction so using the behavior bricks
03:23 - essentially the bullets destroy the
03:25 - whole thing then they spawn that
03:27 - so really nice
03:29 - and on this one by touching these
03:30 - platforms you can move over there how
03:32 - the cannon rotates
03:34 - and by going here boom you can fire a
03:37 - bullet and try to hit something
03:39 - so again this whole thing is all running
03:40 - just on these really interesting
03:41 - behavior bricks then there's a bunch
03:43 - more demo scenes and of course the
03:45 - online tutorial which you can follow the
03:46 - guided tutorials alright so just by
03:48 - looking at these you can already see how
03:50 - this micro game is actually quite
03:51 - capable of building tons of unique
03:53 - scenarios
03:54 - the project includes tons of lego bricks
03:56 - for you to use to build anything so if
03:58 - you go inside prefabs lego models and
04:00 - over here some brick collections so
04:02 - there you go tons of them
04:04 - so then using the lego system you can
04:06 - click you can grab one of these then
04:08 - just connect them directly down then
04:10 - grab this one click on that one so as
04:12 - you can see this has a really nice
04:13 - building system so very quickly you can
04:15 - build some legos make something look
04:16 - really interesting but on top of that
04:18 - you can also import some even more
04:20 - custom objects lego has an official
04:22 - program called bricklink studio in there
04:25 - you can create your own objects using
04:26 - official lego bricks so you can really
04:28 - build anything that you could build
04:29 - using real lego bricks and then you can
04:31 - export that model and import it into
04:33 - unity there's a tutorial over here on
04:35 - until learn showing you through the home
04:37 - process okay so that's the lego contest
04:39 - running right now it ends in november so
04:41 - you have a couple of weeks to build
04:43 - something really interesting pick a
04:44 - category build something and who knows
04:46 - maybe you win and your game will be
04:48 - playable on a real lego store that would
04:50 - be pretty exciting to go to your local
04:52 - lego store and play your own game on a
04:54 - real nice arcade it's definitely a very
04:56 - unique reward so if you're interested
04:58 - definitely go ahead and participate
04:59 - alright hope that's useful check out
