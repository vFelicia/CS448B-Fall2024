00:00 - in this video we're going to look at
00:01 - animator blend trees this is a super
00:03 - useful animator feature to help you
00:05 - blend between various states of
00:06 - animation
00:07 - you define some parameters and some
00:09 - logic and it automatically chooses the
00:10 - right animation
00:11 - let's begin
00:17 - all right so here's what we want to make
00:19 - i have my simple character just standing
00:20 - around
00:21 - this is being animated using sprite
00:23 - based animation but you can use any
00:24 - animation type
00:25 - and right now it's on idle and as i move
00:27 - right it plays the right animation
00:29 - as i move left that animation move up
00:31 - and move down
00:32 - so as you can see all the animations are
00:34 - correctly chosen and as i stop moving it
00:36 - goes back to idle and it also chooses
00:38 - the correct idle animation
00:40 - so here is the final animator component
00:42 - with an idle blend tree and a movement
00:43 - plenty
00:44 - and each of these trees is composed of a
00:46 - bunch of animations so as you can see it
00:47 - takes a bunch of parameters and then
00:49 - decides which of these animations to
00:50 - play so this is a really useful feature
00:52 - and the character sprite that i'm using
00:54 - here is from the complete visual
00:55 - scripting course that i'm currently
00:56 - working on
00:57 - one of the games is an action rpg using
00:59 - this character so if you're interested
01:01 - in a visual scripting course check the
01:02 - link in the description
01:03 - alright so this is our goal let's get to
01:05 - it okay so here i am in my starting
01:08 - scene
01:08 - all i have is just a simple player
01:10 - character completely static with no
01:11 - animations
01:12 - okay so let's begin by selecting the
01:14 - player game object and we're going to
01:16 - add a component
01:17 - and it will be the animator component
01:19 - then as you can see it requires an
01:20 - animator controller
01:21 - so on the project files right click go
01:24 - into create and down here we have the
01:25 - animator controller
01:27 - so the player animator controller
01:30 - and here just drag the object okay now
01:32 - if you double click on the animator
01:34 - controller
01:35 - yep out pops out the animator window and
01:37 - now in here if you right click
01:39 - you can create a normal state so create
01:41 - the normal one then in here you can
01:43 - select the motion which is the animation
01:45 - so that's how you add a normal animation
01:48 - however you can also right click
01:49 - and over here create a new blend tree so
01:52 - there it is the blend tree
01:53 - and now if you double click you can go
01:55 - inside the blend tree
01:56 - all right so this is the inside of our
01:58 - blend tree and now with the one tree
02:00 - selected
02:00 - here in the inspector we can see a bunch
02:02 - of options first one we see the blend
02:04 - type
02:05 - so essentially over here we have the
02:07 - number of dimensions and for now let's
02:08 - leave it at the simplest one possible so
02:10 - just one dimension
02:12 - then we can select the parameter so by
02:14 - default it already
02:15 - added one but let's add a proper one
02:17 - from scratch so click on the plus icon
02:19 - to add new parameter
02:20 - and then click make it a float parameter
02:23 - and we're going to name this the
02:24 - horizontal movement
02:26 - so in here on the parameter click on the
02:27 - drop down menu and select the horizontal
02:29 - movement
02:30 - and now we can get rid of the default
02:31 - one so there it is okay so we select the
02:33 - parameter and then here we have a list
02:35 - of motions
02:36 - so these are all the separate animations
02:39 - and over here on the project files i
02:40 - already prepared some animations
02:42 - previously
02:43 - so in this case i'm using sprite based
02:44 - animation but you can use any type of
02:46 - animation
02:47 - and for now let's click on the plus icon
02:49 - in order to add a new motion field
02:51 - and let's select the wonk right
02:52 - animation so there it is you can see
02:54 - that it added a new state
02:55 - and let's add another one also make it a
02:57 - motion field
02:58 - and for the motion select the walk left
03:01 - alright so now here we see some
03:02 - parameters
03:03 - so the first one is over here the
03:04 - threshold and you might see that the
03:06 - value is locked if so over here you have
03:09 - a checkbox for automated thresholds so
03:11 - if you untick this one you can now
03:12 - manually edit the threshold
03:14 - so for the one left let's put it at -1
03:16 - and you won't write at plus one
03:18 - so down here we can see the horizontal
03:20 - movement and we can click and drag in
03:22 - order to modify it and over there we can
03:24 - see which one is working
03:25 - so then here you can head on plane there
03:27 - you go he's walking left and if i move
03:29 - it to pause one now he's walking right
03:30 - so yep exactly as we want so in this
03:33 - case we're using sprite-based animations
03:35 - so it will only play either one or the
03:37 - other one
03:38 - but if you were using some more complex
03:39 - animations with actual movement on the
03:41 - objects then it would interpolate
03:43 - between them
03:44 - so in this case on the threshold it
03:45 - won't choose which animation to play
03:47 - depending on if the value is above the
03:50 - certain threshold
03:51 - so if the value is above minus one then
03:52 - we're going to play the left animation
03:54 - down here we can hit on plane or to
03:56 - preview
03:56 - so at minus one it's playing that one
03:58 - and if i push it up to one yep there you
04:00 - go it's playing the one right animation
04:02 - okay so that's the threshold and next to
04:04 - it we have the animation speed
04:06 - so this is essentially the animation
04:08 - time scale so using this we can make an
04:10 - animation go faster or slower so for
04:12 - example let's make the walk right
04:14 - go twice as fast and if there you go
04:16 - walk right is going really fast and one
04:18 - left is going normal and lastly you have
04:20 - the mirror setting which lets you mirror
04:21 - an animation
04:22 - all right so those are all the settings
04:24 - and with this we have our basic lengthy
04:26 - working
04:26 - now all we need to do in order to make
04:28 - this work is to
04:29 - modify the horizontal amount parameter
04:31 - through our code so we just need to do
04:33 - that and our animations work perfectly
04:35 - okay so let's go into the player script
04:37 - here it is just a very very basic
04:40 - character controller
04:41 - i covered something similar in a
04:43 - separate video so go watch that if you
04:45 - want to learn more
04:45 - essentially here we just have some
04:47 - keyboard inputs
04:48 - and then we're calculating a move
04:50 - direction vector then we have a test if
04:52 - we are idle or if we are moving
04:54 - so it's a very small very simple script
04:57 - and now it's in here that we want to
04:58 - modify the parameter on the animator
05:00 - so first let's go up here and define a
05:02 - field for the animator animator
05:05 - and on the way we grab the animator get
05:07 - component of type animator
05:10 - and then down here okay we get our
05:12 - inputs we make our movement direction
05:14 - vector
05:14 - and if we are moving let's go into the
05:16 - animator
05:18 - and we're going to set a float parameter
05:20 - so set float
05:21 - and then the name we used was horizontal
05:23 - movement
05:25 - and then for the value which is going to
05:26 - be our move direction vector
05:28 - dot x all right so just like this
05:31 - everything should be working let's test
05:33 - okay here we are and we something at the
05:35 - anal animation state so it starts off
05:36 - walking and right now
05:38 - it's on the default walking left but if
05:40 - i press right yep there you go please it
05:42 - won't write animation and if i press
05:44 - left yep there we go playing left
05:46 - alright so our basic logic is fully
05:48 - working
05:49 - now let's just add the idle animation
05:51 - state so for that we need to go back
05:53 - into the parent animator so up here you
05:54 - can see the layers that we are so we are
05:56 - inside the blend three
05:58 - so if we click on this one yep we go up
06:00 - one level
06:01 - all right we have our plan tree and we
06:02 - can also rename this
06:04 - so the movement entry and then we want
06:07 - to add the i don't state
06:08 - so let's right click create a new state
06:10 - let's make it also a blind tree
06:12 - and let's name it our i don't like dream
06:15 - and we're going to start off with this
06:16 - one so just right click in order to
06:18 - set this layer as a default state okay
06:20 - so this is the default state
06:22 - and in order to transition between idle
06:24 - and movement let's add another parameter
06:26 - so up here create a new one
06:27 - make it a boolean and call this is
06:29 - moving
06:30 - and then we take this we right click we
06:32 - make a transition onto the
06:34 - movement and on this transition we're
06:36 - going to add the condition so if the
06:38 - condition
06:38 - is the parameter is moving if it is true
06:41 - then we transition into movement
06:43 - and then from movement make a transition
06:44 - back and from this one we also add the
06:47 - is moving
06:48 - and in this case if it's set to false
06:50 - and here in the settings let's make it
06:52 - automatic so with no
06:53 - exit time no transition duration
06:58 - all right so we have the logic for our
07:00 - starter state as well as transitioning
07:02 - between idle
07:03 - and movement so now let's set up the
07:05 - idle blendery
07:06 - and in here we're going to do pretty
07:08 - much the exact same thing that we did
07:10 - with the other one
07:11 - so we're going to use the same
07:12 - horizontal movement parameter so let's
07:14 - add two motions
07:18 - so there it is the addon left and i
07:19 - don't write so down there we can see the
07:21 - preview so with this one on minus one
07:23 - yep there you go either left and on the
07:25 - right and yep i don't write
07:26 - alright so that's pretty much it now
07:28 - back in the code in here we already have
07:30 - a volume for is idle
07:32 - so the is moving is essentially going to
07:33 - be the opposite of this one
07:35 - so it's simply testing if they move x
07:37 - and move y if both are at zero then the
07:39 - character is idle if not then it is
07:40 - moving
07:41 - so in here just going to the animator in
07:43 - order to call set boolean
07:45 - and we give the name is moving so is
07:48 - moving
07:49 - in this case we set it to true and up
07:51 - here we set it to false
07:53 - we could also obviously just put it in
07:55 - here and put it not is idle
07:57 - so just like this would work but let's
07:58 - keep it the manual approach for now
08:00 - okay so with this let's test okay here
08:02 - we are starting off idle on the left
08:04 - side yep there you go and if i press the
08:06 - left button
08:06 - if there you go he's walking left and
08:08 - let go and yep he's back into i don't
08:11 - now move right yep moving right let go
08:13 - and yep he's walking right
08:15 - all right so it seems like all of our
08:16 - logic is fully working awesome
08:18 - so the logic is all working but so far
08:20 - we've been using a one-dimensional point
08:22 - tree
08:23 - so everything is working but only going
08:24 - from left to right if we go up
08:26 - yep everything does not work so let's
08:28 - fix that over here on the movement one
08:31 - tree
08:31 - again we have our blend type and we have
08:34 - one direction
08:34 - and then we have some other blend types
08:36 - so the next one is 2d simple directional
08:39 - so this one is for when you have just
08:41 - one animation for each direction
08:43 - then you have to the freeform which is
08:45 - when you want multiple animations for
08:47 - each direction
08:47 - and to the freeform cartesian which is
08:50 - used when the animations are not based
08:52 - on direction so for our case we want the
08:53 - simplest possible so let's pick just the
08:55 - 2d simple directional
08:57 - and now right away we see that our graph
08:58 - went from a flat graph to a 2d graph
09:00 - so we now have an x and y axis and up
09:03 - here we actually need two parameters so
09:05 - let's create another one for the
09:06 - vertical movement
09:08 - so in here create a new float call it
09:10 - the vertical movement
09:13 - and use this on the y axis and over here
09:16 - we need to add all the other motions
09:20 - all right there they are and now instead
09:22 - of having just a single threshold we
09:24 - have the position x and the position y
09:31 - all right so they're on setup all of
09:32 - them with their thresholds correctly set
09:35 - and in here you can click and drag the
09:36 - red position so this will modify
09:38 - both of our parameters so as i move to
09:40 - the right yep there you go it's
09:42 - modifying the horizontal amount
09:43 - so that one is at one and the vertical
09:45 - is pretty much at zero
09:46 - and we can see down here on our preview
09:48 - yep there we go we've got the one cryo
09:50 - animation
09:50 - and if we go up there yep we've got one
09:52 - cup then walk down
09:54 - and one left alright so you can see that
09:56 - everything is perfectly working
09:58 - so based on the values that we give our
10:00 - parameters we're correctly choosing the
10:01 - right animation
10:02 - so our movement one tree is fully
10:04 - working and now we just need to add the
10:06 - exact same thing over here on the island
10:07 - laundry
10:14 - alright so there it is set up exactly
10:16 - the same so over there we've got along
10:18 - right idle up idle down and item left
10:20 - alright so we have both of our trees
10:22 - working both of them dependent on the
10:24 - horizontal and vertical movement
10:26 - parameters
10:26 - and on the main animator we've got our
10:28 - basic transitions based on the is moving
10:30 - volume
10:30 - so all that's left is to set our
10:32 - vertical movement through our code
10:34 - so over here it's very simple we're just
10:36 - going to do pretty much the exact same
10:37 - thing so we're going to set another
10:38 - float
10:39 - for the vertical movement and this case
10:41 - is the move there dot y
10:43 - alright so that's it that's all we need
10:45 - to do and everything should be working
10:46 - so let's test
10:48 - okay center off right on left move to
10:49 - the right yep wonking and idle move left
10:52 - walking i don't move
10:53 - up walking and i don't move down and
10:55 - walking and i don't
10:57 - alright so over here we have our
10:58 - animation zone fully working so we can
11:00 - move in any direction and based on the
11:02 - parameters that we set the animator
11:04 - correctly chooses which animation it
11:06 - should correctly play
11:07 - so here we have our character with
11:09 - movement working in all directions
11:11 - and naturally you could expand upon this
11:12 - to add even more animations to the entry
11:14 - and add some specific animations for
11:16 - up left upright and so on and fit all
11:19 - the diagonals
11:20 - alright so here it is everything working
11:22 - awesome so here you can see the entries
11:24 - in action and how they help you manage
11:25 - multiple animations based on just a
11:27 - handful of parameters
11:28 - now like i said this character and this
11:30 - point tree is from the complete visual
11:32 - scripting course that i'm currently
11:33 - working on
11:34 - one of the games is an action rpg where
11:36 - i won't be using this character
