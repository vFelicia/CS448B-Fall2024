00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - Linda series were making snake in unity
00:03 - in this video we're going to add sprites
00:05 - to our snake body let's begin
00:10 - so this is our scene we have the snake
00:13 - that we can move around food is spawned
00:15 - and I can go to it and have the snake
00:17 - eat it when the snake eats you can see
00:20 - that the body grows and the body is
00:22 - correctly following the path that the
00:24 - snake took so right now we want to
00:26 - actually give it a proper visual so here
00:29 - in the textures folder I have the snake
00:31 - body sprites so let's are off by just
00:34 - replacing the white squares with this
00:35 - texture so here is the snake class and
00:38 - here we have the handle word movement
00:40 - which moves the snake tests if it did
00:43 - eat some food if so it increase the size
00:45 - and checks for all the positions and
00:48 - here is the code that we were using for
00:49 - temporarily displaying our white squares
00:51 - so we want to replace this with our
00:54 - proper texture however we don't want it
00:56 - to constantly be creating and destroying
00:58 - same sprite so we want to create it just
01:00 - once and then reuse that same sprite so
01:02 - let's go up here and let's set up a list
01:05 - to hold our transforms so we have a list
01:10 - to keep track of all of our snake body
01:12 - transforms let's initialize it on our
01:14 - awake and let's go down here when we are
01:18 - increasing our snake move position list
01:21 - and when we increase the size let's
01:23 - create a body visual so let's make a
01:25 - function for that
01:36 - again in order to grab the sprite for
01:38 - our snake body let's go into the game
01:40 - assets class and have another feel for
01:43 - the snake body sprite and we use it in
01:48 - here so in this function we are creating
01:51 - a new game object calling it snake body
01:53 - and adding it with the sprite renderer
01:55 - component and with the correct body
01:57 - sprite so after we create it we simply
01:59 - go into our list and add our snake body
02:07 - game object transfer so we create a new
02:10 - game object and we add it to our list
02:12 - and up here when we increase the body
02:15 - size and let's create one okay so let's
02:17 - see if we are creating a new game object
02:19 - every time our snake eat some food okay
02:22 - there's a snake there's some food I go
02:24 - to it and yep there's the body right
02:27 - there on the corner now I eat another
02:29 - one and now let's pause and check the
02:32 - hierarchy and you have there you go one
02:34 - snake body and another snake body okay
02:36 - so far so good
02:37 - now obviously the issue is we don't want
02:40 - our bodies to be spun on 0 0 parameter
02:42 - correctly placed to follow the snake
02:44 - body so let's see on with that so here
02:46 - we move our snake we increase the body
02:49 - size and create the body transform we
02:51 - validate our snake move positional list
02:53 - and let's comment out this code for now
02:55 - and here we are updating the position of
02:59 - the snake head and afterwards let's also
03:02 - update the rest of our body sprites so
03:05 - let's do a simple cycle on the snake
03:08 - body transform list then here we're
03:12 - going to put our body position base on
03:17 - the snake move position list
03:22 - then we set the snake body dot position
03:26 - to be this new position okay so we are
03:31 - cycling through the entire list and we
03:33 - are setting the position based on the
03:34 - snake move position list which is what
03:36 - we were using previously to see our
03:37 - temporary white squares so let's run the
03:40 - code and see if every single body part
03:41 - now correctly follows the snake path
03:43 - okay there's a snake there's some food
03:46 - now I go to it and yep there you go
03:48 - that's the snake body now I go to
03:50 - another one and yep we now have three
03:53 - and they are all following the path
03:55 - correctly and so is that one so we now
03:57 - have our snake body correctly following
03:59 - the path of our snake now one potential
04:02 - issue we have in here is the sorting
04:04 - order of the sprites we want each body
04:06 - part to be under the previous one so
04:08 - when we create them let's set the
04:10 - sorting order to match their index so to
04:12 - modify the sorting order we simply go
04:14 - into the sprite render and modify the
04:16 - sorting order the entire is already on
04:18 - default as it should be
04:19 - and we simply set it to - the own list
04:22 - count so when we create the first body
04:26 - part it gets added to the list and then
04:28 - gets the sorting order of minus 1 we
04:30 - have the second one minus 2 and so on
04:31 - and so forth so let's see an yep as you
04:34 - can see the bodies are now correctly
04:36 - displayed so you have the head right on
04:38 - top and you can see it when it goes out
04:40 - ok great
04:41 - okay so now let's keep our code
04:42 - organized by creating a class to handle
04:44 - each snake body part so let's go down
04:47 - here and make a product class snake body
04:51 - parts let's create a constructor and
04:58 - inside the constructor and let's copy
05:00 - the snake body let's receive an int for
05:06 - the body index and use that instead and
05:11 - here and let's store our transform and
05:15 - let's also store the current great
05:18 - position now let's make a function to
05:22 - relocate the body and just like that we
05:30 - have a very nice class that can handle
05:32 - everything regarding the snake body so
05:34 - now let's go up here and instead of
05:36 - having a list of transform so let's have
05:39 - a list of snake body part of the private
05:46 - boy create snake body we simply add to
05:50 - the list a new snake body part instead
05:54 - of this we have a update snake body part
05:59 - and we copy this in here except we are
06:02 - using this list instead instead of
06:04 - setting the position directly we call
06:07 - the set worth position function and we
06:09 - give it the snake move position ok so
06:13 - our code is now much easier to follow
06:14 - since we have a dedicated class to
06:16 - handle each body part so we go up here
06:18 - when we increase the snake body we
06:20 - create a body part which in Senshi
06:22 - eights a new instance of that class and
06:24 - adds it to the list and then we have a
06:26 - function to update all the body parts
06:28 - and it does so by calling the function
06:31 - which gives it a grid position and then
06:33 - it takes that great position and moves
06:35 - the transform so let's run the code and
06:37 - see if everything still works ok there's
06:39 - a snake there's the food and yep it
06:41 - grabbed the food and it spawned a new
06:43 - body part and the body part is following
06:45 - and another one and where I'm not a
06:47 - piece of fruit and it is growing
06:48 - perfectly fine and all the sprites are
06:50 - being correctly instantiated so there
06:53 - you have it we took our previous snake
06:55 - body size info and added a visual as
06:57 - well as a simple pass to Hamlet in the
07:00 - next video we're going to deal with the
07:01 - rotation of the sprites including
07:03 - handling corners as long as you can
07:05 - download the project files and utilities
07:06 - from ent code monkey comm if you have
07:08 - any questions post them in the comments
07:10 - and I'll do my best answer them
