00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your codm and I
00:02 - just created something that I think
00:04 - might be a super useful tool to help you
00:05 - learn faster basically I've got my
00:07 - complete course on making my game
00:08 - kitchen chaos there's a free version
00:10 - here on YouTube and a paid version on my
00:12 - site and then what I did was I basically
00:14 - took the giant script for all the
00:16 - lectures everything from these 46
00:18 - lectures then compound with tons of
00:20 - questions that I both asked and answered
00:22 - myself and then I trained a chat GPT
00:25 - assistant on all that data then with
00:26 - that I made a pre complex system that
00:28 - basically en listens to when some
00:29 - someone posts a comment then it asks the
00:31 - bot to generate a reply and post that
00:33 - reply directly on the comment so if
00:35 - someone posts a question after 1 to two
00:36 - minutes there is an automatic B rep now
00:39 - the main benefit of this is obviously
00:40 - Spen personally I always still answer
00:42 - all the question myself manually I've
00:44 - been doing that ever since the course
00:45 - launch and I continue doing it by now
00:47 - I've answered literally thousands of
00:49 - questions in both the free version and
00:50 - the paid version but of course I can
00:52 - only do that at most once or twice per
00:53 - day meaning that if someone has a
00:55 - question might take up to 24 hours for
00:57 - me to get a reply that time delay that
00:59 - can be quite annoying especially if
01:00 - you're trying to learn and you're
01:01 - actively in the middle of it when trying
01:03 - to learn it is very important to keep up
01:04 - the momentum to keep learning get
01:06 - answers to your question and keep it
01:07 - ring so you truly learn whereas with the
01:10 - spot the response is almost instense
01:11 - within 1 to two minutes so if you have a
01:13 - question you can simply post a comment
01:15 - so let's say for example I've heard the
01:17 - Singleton pattern is bad is that true
01:21 - and let's go ahead post a comment
01:22 - there's my comment I just posted now the
01:24 - bot is generating a reply and within 1
01:26 - to two minutes I should have an answer
01:28 - since the bot was trained on the entire
01:30 - text for all of the course lectures as
01:31 - well as many of my own frequently asked
01:33 - questions that I both asked and answered
01:35 - myself because that the response should
01:37 - be pretty actur so let's see and up here
01:39 - it is the automatic AI reply it is
01:41 - saying how the Singleton pattern is not
01:43 - inherently bad it's a tool that can be
01:45 - used well or poorly pretty much like
01:46 - every other programming tool problems
01:49 - sent to rise when Singleton are overused
01:50 - leading to a web of interlock references
01:52 - that can make your code base difficult
01:53 - to manage and understand so yeah this is
01:55 - pretty much exactly what I would say and
01:57 - this is pretty much exactly what I teach
01:58 - in the course Singletons are a two tool
02:00 - and as with any tool they can be used or
02:01 - abused so this is an excellent reply if
02:03 - I was just learning then this would be
02:04 - an excellent way to get a really
02:05 - detailed very correct answer within just
02:07 - two minutes but of course the goal of
02:09 - this bot is not to replace me I will
02:11 - still be answering questions manually
02:12 - the goal for this bot is basally to give
02:14 - a really quick answer so you can
02:15 - continue learning pretty much instantly
02:17 - and then when I see it within the next
02:18 - 24 hours I will then reply to the bot
02:21 - and either confirm or provide some more
02:23 - extra clarification to whatever the bot
02:24 - said so if you own the optional paid
02:26 - version of the course go ahead test it
02:28 - out ask a question and let's see what
02:29 - the bot comes up with now some of you
02:31 - might be wondering why is this feature
02:33 - only enabled on the paid course and not
02:34 - on the free course that is here on
02:35 - YouTube and the answer to that is
02:37 - obviously pretty simple these AI Bots
02:39 - cost money to run and it's actually
02:40 - quite a lot more than a view is worth on
02:42 - YouTube in order to run this bot because
02:44 - it was Stained on so much data the
02:45 - entire course is about 10,000 lines long
02:48 - so because of all that data in order to
02:49 - answer a question in order to generate
02:51 - response it costs anywhere between 10 to
02:53 - 15 cents now that might not sound like a
02:55 - lot but over here on YouTube each view
02:57 - is literally worth just a fraction of a
02:58 - scent my my usual RPM is about $2 which
03:01 - means each view is worth literally 0.2
03:04 - so the cost to run a bot is literally 50
03:06 - times what an average view is worth
03:08 - technically if all of these 1.7 million
03:10 - views if all of these people ask a
03:11 - question then I would owe open AI about
03:13 - 200 Grand so as you can tell that is
03:16 - really not something that I can afford
03:17 - I'd love to enable this feature to help
03:19 - out everyone but it's really just not
03:21 - possible either way if you're following
03:22 - the course for free on YouTube I will
03:24 - still be answering all those question
03:25 - manually but if you have the optional
03:27 - paid version go ahead and ask a question
03:28 - the bot will respond almost immediately
03:30 - and then I will manually give an extra
03:32 - answer and if you're curious in the
03:34 - technical terms building this was
03:35 - actually quite an interesting challenge
03:37 - in technical terms it involves quite a
03:39 - lot of things all working together to
03:40 - make this work first it involves a
03:42 - teachable web hook this one is fired
03:44 - automatically whenever someone posts a
03:45 - comment then that web hook goes into my
03:47 - PHP web server which then listens to it
03:49 - and interacts with the opening eye API
03:52 - it asks it to generate a reply but that
03:54 - process that one is not instant it
03:56 - actually creates a run and goes into a
03:58 - queue that only generates a resp
03:59 - response afterwards so then I have to
04:01 - periodically query the API to see if the
04:03 - response has been generated when it does
04:05 - complete that process then I ask the
04:06 - open AI API to get the final message
04:08 - then with that message suddenly
04:10 - teachable does not actually have an API
04:11 - endpoint for automatically posting a
04:13 - comment so because of that I actually
04:15 - had to use some python I had to learn
04:17 - how to use the selenium package this one
04:19 - lets you automate interacting with
04:21 - websites in various ways so basically
04:23 - with that script it automatically goes
04:24 - onto the course website it pretty much
04:26 - writes the comment that the chat GP
04:28 - generated and simply manually post that
04:30 - comment this is definitely a fun
04:31 - challenge to get all of this working all
04:33 - these pieces this was quite tricky but
04:35 - I'm quite happy with the final result
04:37 - I'm not an expert in python or Linux or
04:39 - even PHP in general so building this
04:42 - actually required quite a lot of trial
04:43 - and error but it was a fun Challenge and
04:44 - the final system works very well all
04:46 - right so I hope you find this new
04:48 - feature useful if this is as helpful as
04:50 - I hope it will be then I plan to keep
04:52 - doing this for pretty much every course
04:53 - that I make I really think the speed in
04:55 - getting an automated reply that is
04:57 - hopefully very accurate I really think
04:58 - that will help people learn quite a lot
05:00 - faster quite a lot better all right so
05:02 - go ahead post a comment and try it out
05:04 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
05:05 - next time
