00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this course you will learn how to
00:03 - make complete games from start to finish
00:05 - all using unity visual scripting without
00:07 - writing a single line of code
00:10 - in this course you're going to build not
00:11 - one but two games a platformer and a
00:14 - action rpg game
00:15 - by building several games you will learn
00:17 - how visual scripting works and how you
00:19 - can apply it to any game
00:21 - about me i'm a professional indie game
00:23 - developer with several successful games
00:25 - published on steam covering a wide range
00:26 - of genres
00:27 - i've been programming for over 20 years
00:29 - and using unity for almost 10
00:31 - also a couple of years ago i started a
00:33 - youtube channel making free tutorial
00:34 - videos to share my knowledge to help you
00:36 - learn how to make your own games
00:38 - so if you'd like to try out my learning
00:40 - style before purchasing the course you
00:42 - can watch the over 300 videos available
00:44 - for free on the youtube channel
00:46 - they are presented as clear step-by-step
00:48 - tutorials just like this course
00:50 - so a bit more about the games in this
00:52 - course you're going to build not one but
00:53 - two complete games
00:55 - by building various genres you'll better
00:57 - learn how to use visual scripting in any
00:58 - scenario
00:59 - first we start off with the platformer
01:01 - game this is the simplest one and works
01:03 - as a great introduction to visual
01:05 - scripting
01:06 - starting off just by learning how to
01:07 - handle movement physics collisions
01:09 - jumping and so on then as you learn the
01:12 - basics we start adding more features
01:14 - and the final game is a simple but very
01:16 - nice platformer
01:17 - so there's moving platforms there's
01:19 - multiple levels hazards coins lava and
01:21 - so on
01:22 - the second game is the action rpg this
01:24 - one is a very complete game with tons of
01:26 - features
01:27 - it's got multiple weapons multiple
01:29 - enemies and hazards there's coins and
01:31 - pickups dungeons with portons cannons
01:33 - and lava
01:34 - so the final game is really feature rich
01:36 - once again all of this built without
01:38 - writing a single line of code this one
01:40 - is more complex
01:41 - thanks to building on top of the
01:42 - knowledge gained while making the
01:43 - platform again
01:44 - both games are included in the course
01:46 - from start to finish and they are set up
01:47 - to provide a nice smooth learning curve
01:50 - so first you'll learn the absolute
01:51 - basics in the platformer and then
01:53 - continue
01:53 - learning and apply that base knowledge
01:55 - to the rpg game so by the end you will
01:57 - have two complete games as well as the
01:59 - knowledge to be able to then go ahead
02:01 - and use visual scripting to make any
02:03 - game in
02:03 - any genre you can think of visual
02:05 - scripting also works as an excellent
02:07 - tool for learning programming
02:08 - even if you've never written any code by
02:10 - the end of this course you will have
02:12 - learned how logic works and how objects
02:14 - and scripts interact with one another
02:16 - with that knowledge if you want you can
02:17 - then go ahead and easily learn
02:19 - programming or stick with visual
02:20 - scripting
02:21 - so this is a great course both for
02:22 - absolute beginners who want to start
02:24 - commonly from scratch
02:25 - and also great for more advanced users
02:27 - who want to see more advanced use cases
02:29 - for visual scripting
02:30 - or just want to see how to design and
02:32 - implement some interesting mechanics
02:34 - this complete course is presented as a
02:36 - thorough step-by-step guide where i will
02:37 - show you exactly how to do what i'm
02:39 - doing
02:39 - and why it is that i'm doing it so you
02:41 - can learn how to think like a
02:42 - professional indie game developer
02:44 - every single lecture also includes the
02:46 - complete project files so you can
02:47 - download them and follow along
02:49 - exactly as i'm doing if you feel lost or

02:56 - you may have
02:57 - alright so go ahead join me on this
02:59 - course and let's learn how to master
03:00 - visual scripting and build some awesome
03:02 - games together
