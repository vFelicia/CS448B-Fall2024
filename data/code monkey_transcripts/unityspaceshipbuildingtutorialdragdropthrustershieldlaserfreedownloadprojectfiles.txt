00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - so a while ago i made a video on a game
00:04 - called nimbatus it's an interesting game
00:06 - where you build your drones from a bunch
00:07 - of parts the drone is built on a grid
00:09 - and you drag and drop all the parts to
00:11 - connect them and it's also up to you to
00:13 - define what key triggers what object for
00:15 - example place the thruster behind the
00:16 - drone then assign it to the w key so
00:18 - when you press w it activates the thrust
00:20 - and moves your drone forward then you
00:22 - have all kinds of parts like magnets
00:23 - fuel energy and laser turrets and so on
00:26 - you bomb watch your drones and go out on
00:28 - missions depending on the mission type
00:29 - it's up to you to build the right drone
00:31 - for the right mission i made that quick
00:33 - video talking about that interesting
00:34 - mechanic and in there i asked if you'd
00:36 - like to see a tutorial video on it so
00:38 - lately that's what i've been working on
00:39 - this one is a relatively complex system
00:41 - but the code is actually nicely set up
00:43 - and easy to understand you can download
00:45 - the project files link in the
00:46 - description to see how it all works for
00:47 - yourself
00:48 - the final system came out really well it
00:50 - works exactly as intended it's super
00:52 - easy to use and visually also looks
00:53 - pretty awesome let's see how i made it
00:55 - starting from scratch until the final
00:57 - polish game and if you like these types
00:59 - of videos where i remake some mechanics
01:00 - from some game then hit the like button
01:02 - and check out the entire how it's made
01:03 - plays if you prefer a more guided path
01:06 - with step-by-step lectures then check
01:08 - out my complete courses learn how to
01:10 - make a bundler defender game using
01:11 - c-sharp just like i make my own steam
01:13 - games or learn how to make games
01:16 - entirely using visual scripting or learn
01:18 - all about unity with the ultimate
01:19 - overview course which contains over 13
01:22 - lectures each covering a different tool
01:23 - or feature of the engine to help you
01:25 - make better games faster i'm always
01:27 - available in the courses q a section
01:29 - answering your questions every single
01:30 - day so check out all the courses with
01:32 - the link in the description okay so i
01:33 - actually made most of this system while
01:35 - on various live streams that's why
01:36 - there's this overlay within live chat
01:38 - characters in my camera if you want to
01:40 - know when i go live then go ahead and
01:42 - hit the bell icon or set up an account
01:43 - on the website and if you're curious as
01:45 - to how this overlay works i made a video
01:47 - on the how to make unity transparent and
01:50 - another one on my mesh animation system
01:52 - so i start by first making the main part
01:54 - just a simple cube
01:56 - then for the first part i tried to make
01:57 - was the thruster made a simple visual
01:59 - just based on cubes and set up a simple
02:01 - script for it it really just uses the
02:03 - main ship rigid body and applies a force
02:05 - based on direction of the thruster
02:07 - object that's it very simple and it
02:09 - already works pretty great i can place
02:10 - the thruster anywhere and it does push
02:12 - the ship exactly as it should i decided
02:14 - to make this system using 3d meshes but
02:16 - logic is mostly in 2d so for getting the
02:18 - mouse position it's actually pretty
02:19 - simple i covered it in detail in another
02:21 - video there's just a plane with a
02:23 - collider and that's the mouse position
02:25 - next up i worked on a very important
02:27 - part of this system handling the
02:28 - separation between edit and play mode
02:31 - basically during edit the parts are just
02:33 - visuals and colliders they have no logic
02:35 - and then in play mode the ship has a
02:36 - rigid body with gravity and all of the
02:38 - parts have their logic handling that
02:40 - logic was easy but also a bit complex
02:43 - basically i need to make a sort of save
02:44 - and load system so that i can save in
02:46 - the edit scene and load the same ship
02:48 - with the same parts in the same
02:49 - positions in the placing then i expand
02:51 - on the part logic to have a generic key
02:53 - to activate with that it was now
02:55 - possible to have multiple thrusters and
02:57 - each activated by a different key just
02:59 - with that the spaceship was already
03:00 - fully functional just had some thrusters
03:03 - on each side and it can already move
03:04 - anywhere with that working then it was
03:07 - time to handle multiple part types for
03:09 - the second one i chose a simple shield
03:11 - to identify each part i use scriptable
03:13 - objects which are insanely useful
03:15 - really very useful for managing various
03:17 - types of objects
03:18 - with that i had to expand the safe mode
03:20 - logic from edit to play mode in order to
03:22 - support multiple types
03:24 - doing this involves generalizing the
03:26 - logic so that it can work with any type
03:28 - again this involves some thinking and
03:30 - some clever use of interfaces interfaces
03:32 - are insanely useful i also made a video
03:34 - on them with that i could now support
03:36 - any number of different types each of
03:38 - them with whatever logic they need to
03:39 - work and the whole system works
03:40 - flawlessly then it was time to handle
03:42 - object selection they all have call
03:44 - editors so this one was just a basic
03:46 - raycast exam like i did in the mouse
03:48 - position video i also made a simple ui
03:50 - to see what object was currently
03:52 - selected and the ui updates based on
03:54 - some simple c sharp events at that point
03:56 - there was a moment on stream where i
03:58 - went totally insane basically a find
04:00 - wasn't working and i had no idea why the
04:02 - name was correct the script was placed
04:04 - on the correct object and everything
04:06 - should be working but it wasn't it was
04:07 - constantly getting a non-reference
04:09 - exception as if the code couldn't find
04:10 - the object so after going crazy for a
04:12 - few minutes i finally found the culprit
04:14 - it was a tiny invisible space right in
04:17 - the end of the name of the button it had
04:18 - the correct name but then a space at the
04:20 - end this was another great example of
04:22 - how strings are so brittle and how you
04:24 - should avoid using them whenever
04:25 - possible for me i really only use
04:27 - strings in this one specific instance
04:29 - where i'm doing a find and even with
04:30 - using them so little i still get errors
04:32 - like this
04:33 - so impossible try to avoid using strings
04:36 - anyway so i made the buttons work on the
04:37 - ui with this i could now play some of
04:39 - the objects i could select any of them
04:42 - and choose what key activates what
04:43 - object this was at the end of the first
04:45 - live stream around 2 hours of work just
04:47 - without the system was already working
04:49 - pretty well at that point the game was
04:51 - still just some boring cubes so i used
04:53 - my recently acquired wonder knowledge to
04:55 - make some simple meshes i've only been
04:57 - learning blender for a few hours but i'm
04:59 - already able to do some nice simple
05:00 - meshes
05:01 - if you want to learn from the same
05:02 - course that i've been learning from then
05:04 - it's the gamedevtv blender 3d modeling
05:06 - course i actually worked with gamedev tv
05:09 - to create a curated bundle that includes
05:11 - that course and two more with some
05:12 - really nice discount it's available on
05:14 - the website so check the link in the
05:16 - description if you also want to learn
05:17 - some blender or unity or some
05:19 - programming patterns then one very
05:21 - important part of this system is being
05:22 - able to rebind keys to actions
05:25 - that way the player can add any part
05:26 - they want and they can activate it with
05:28 - any key they want then i continue
05:30 - working on the game during the second
05:31 - live stream first task was meant to be a
05:33 - simple one just add some particle system
05:35 - visuals to the thruster this was meant
05:37 - to be an easy task to start the live
05:38 - stream but was actually quite tricky
05:40 - turns out to start and stop emitting
05:42 - particles isn't as simple as calling
05:44 - play and stop once you can't stop on the
05:46 - particle system then for some reason you
05:48 - can't hit play again so it took a while
05:50 - but with some googling i found the
05:52 - answer it means you just need to
05:53 - manually enable or disable just the
05:55 - particle emission then making them look
05:57 - good just added some simple glow and it
05:59 - already looks great
06:01 - after that was another crucial part of
06:03 - this system being able to drag and drop
06:04 - to place the parts here was another
06:07 - example of me learning something new
06:08 - while on stream to get the drag event i
06:10 - use the unity event system and just
06:12 - implement the ibn drag handler interface
06:15 - however it turns out that if you just
06:16 - implement that one it doesn't actually
06:18 - trigger the event in order for that
06:20 - event to be fired you also need to
06:22 - implement the idrac handler even if you
06:24 - don't use it so that was an interesting
06:26 - quirk of the system and showed that even
06:28 - for me i'm still constantly learning new
06:29 - things then adding some snapping was
06:31 - pretty easy just run the position that's
06:33 - it with that the ship can now be much
06:35 - more well built with all the parts in
06:37 - the perfect locations
06:38 - for another quick visual was adding the
06:40 - part connections which is a simple cube
06:42 - stretched out to touch the new parts
06:44 - very simple and fixed the issue of
06:46 - having parts visually in the middle of
06:47 - the air
06:48 - at this point the system was already
06:49 - good enough to build the ship and play
06:51 - around with it by the way if you find
06:53 - the video helpful please hit the like
06:54 - button it's a tiny thing but really does
06:56 - help thanks however keeping a static
06:59 - camera limits how much i can move so the
07:00 - next task was adding some camera
07:02 - movement this was possibly the easiest
07:04 - task ever literally just added a new
07:06 - cinemachine virtual camera just assigned
07:08 - the ship as a follow and unlocked target
07:10 - and that's really it all the defaults
07:12 - are already perfect city machine is
07:14 - really awesome and you should definitely
07:15 - use it
07:16 - it makes handling cameras so insanely
07:18 - easy the next task was also quite easy
07:21 - thanks to how i focused on writing good
07:23 - clean code throughout the making of this
07:24 - project the goal was to go back to edit
07:27 - mode in order to allow the player to
07:28 - iterate upon the ship they were building
07:30 - this was as simple as instantiating the
07:32 - edit mode prefabs instead of the play
07:33 - mode prefabs so a great example of how
07:36 - you can make things much easier for
07:37 - yourself if you just take time to
07:39 - structure your code properly now that i
07:41 - could get back to edit mode in order to
07:43 - allow the player to iterate upon the
07:44 - ship it's crucial to be able to move in
07:46 - late parts and in thinking of how i
07:48 - could enable some dragging to move apart
07:50 - i came up with a very simple solution i
07:52 - could just delete the part and as soon
07:54 - as i start moving then automatically
07:55 - enable the part placement to place a new
07:57 - part exactly the previous one then as i
08:00 - was handling destruction i actually came
08:01 - across another interesting issue the
08:03 - code wasn't working i was deleting the
08:05 - part but it wasn't really disappearing
08:07 - it was still being counted as a child
08:09 - object right after deleting
08:10 - this was another excellent example of
08:12 - the power of experience
08:14 - i immediately recognized what was going
08:16 - on because i've encountered this exact
08:17 - specific issue one time before while
08:19 - working on one of my games the issue is
08:21 - that unity doesn't immediately destroy
08:23 - the object and update the parent-child
08:25 - relationships if you call destroy and
08:27 - right after checking the number of
08:28 - children it still has the same amount so
08:31 - when i first encountered this bug
08:32 - several years ago i think it was while
08:34 - working on battleground tycoon back then
08:36 - it took me hours of going crazy to
08:38 - figure out what was going on whereas now
08:40 - thanks to the power of experience i
08:41 - immediately recognized the issue and
08:43 - fixed it in a few seconds so yep another
08:45 - practical example of how everything
08:47 - becomes much easier the more experience
08:48 - you have with the delete working
08:50 - properly it was time to handle drag drop
08:52 - movement this was also pretty easy the
08:54 - only sort of tricky part is handling the
08:56 - drag drop events on world objects if you
08:59 - wanted to work on a world object you
09:01 - need to add a physics raycaster to the
09:02 - event system up next i added a proper
09:05 - action to the shield it activates using
09:07 - a key which can be rebound just like the
09:09 - thruster for the activation it just
09:12 - grows a shield sphere and for the visual
09:14 - i actually made a really interesting
09:16 - shield shader effect quite a long time
09:18 - ago this was the perfect time to reuse
09:20 - that shader so with that and with the
09:21 - basic logic and yep the shield was
09:23 - working this was the end of the second
09:25 - live stream again another super
09:26 - productive two hours thank you all for
09:28 - joining me and before the third live
09:30 - stream i also added a really cool new
09:32 - feature to my overlay you can go to your
09:34 - user page on the website and customize
09:36 - your character this was a feature that
09:38 - already existed but now on this update
09:40 - you can select a custom texture so you
09:42 - can draw over the default body parts you
09:45 - can draw anything and make something
09:46 - really nice and custom
09:48 - it's a pretty fun feature for live
09:49 - streams and during this third one
09:51 - actually a bunch of people try them out
09:52 - and it worked quite well first task was
09:54 - adding another spaceship part a canon
09:56 - that would fire projectiles just need to
09:59 - create a new scriptable object for the
10:01 - new part type create the prefabs for
10:03 - edit mode and play mode and these
10:04 - scripts to run the custom part logic so
10:06 - yep super easy to add any number of
10:08 - parts to the system then the logic for
10:11 - the canon this one is all about shooting
10:12 - projectiles it just spawns a bullet
10:14 - prefab which moves straight forward
10:16 - pointing towards the mouse position the
10:18 - visual for the bullet is also pretty
10:19 - simple just add a nice material with
10:21 - some mission and some bloom and already
10:23 - looks pretty good and for another super
10:25 - awesome built-in unity tool is the trail
10:27 - renderer you just need to add the
10:29 - component and play with some settings
10:31 - and in a few seconds you've got a really
10:32 - nice drill this one for example is one
10:34 - of the unity tools that i cover in
10:36 - detail in my ultimate tnt overview
10:38 - course after that was handling some
10:40 - collisions just some physics and legends
10:42 - and when they happen just destroy the
10:44 - bullet and create a spawn explosion
10:46 - effect then it was time to make a basic
10:48 - enemy i just wanted to make something
10:50 - that i could damage so just made a
10:51 - simple hue visual the enemy has a
10:53 - collateral and also script with that i
10:55 - just went into the bolt logic to test if
10:57 - the collision was with an object that
10:59 - had the enemy script and if so just deal
11:01 - damage for handling damage once again i
11:03 - reused my super useful health system i
11:06 - actually made this class on the very
11:07 - first video on this channel four years
11:09 - ago so that was a very long time ago and
11:11 - here i am still reusing it in a new
11:13 - project it's super simple to create a
11:15 - new health system and connecting it to
11:17 - the enemy damage function for the visual
11:19 - i went with the world canvas for the
11:20 - health bar these are also super useful i
11:23 - made a video on them you can place ui
11:25 - elements in the world and it's super
11:26 - useful because the ui image has a fill
11:28 - amount setting which makes it perfect
11:30 - for making a health bar
11:32 - just add that listen to some events on
11:33 - the health system to update the health
11:35 - bar and everything works next up just
11:37 - for fun i had a quick mini-map i covered
11:39 - how to do this in several videos
11:41 - specifically i made a short where i
11:43 - built this in under 60 seconds it's
11:45 - really easy all it requires is a second
11:47 - camera that only renders objects on the
11:49 - minimap layer and a render texture where
11:51 - that camera will render onto
11:53 - so in a very short amount of time
11:55 - already had a nice mini-map working
11:57 - after that i made another part just for
11:59 - fun just to be able to see how fast i
12:00 - could build it because the code is so
12:02 - well set up this only took about 10
12:04 - minutes the part was making a laser so
12:06 - just making the scriptable object in the
12:08 - prefabs then script for it so it works
12:10 - kind of like a static bullet there's a
12:12 - collider that stretches towards the
12:14 - mouse position and deals damage to
12:16 - anything it touches and at that point
12:18 - that was the end of the final live
12:19 - stream so after that i just worked a bit
12:21 - more on my own just publishing a few
12:23 - things first i added some icons to the
12:26 - part buttons just took some screenshots
12:28 - of the parts
12:29 - then also implemented a save and load
12:31 - system onto an actual file
12:33 - again this was super easy because the
12:34 - whole edit play mode connection already
12:36 - worked just like a save all i had to do
12:38 - was actually save that data onto a file
12:41 - doing that really helped with iteration
12:42 - so i no longer need to rebuild the same
12:44 - ship over and over again
12:46 - then i added a visual for the selected
12:48 - part so you know which one you're
12:49 - interacting with edit the same health
12:51 - system to the ship i made the enemies
12:54 - fire bullets that can damage the ship
12:55 - and made the shield protect from the
12:57 - enemy bullets and finally just had a
12:59 - simple win condition so just destroy all
13:01 - the enemies and you win with all that
13:03 - done over here is the final system
13:05 - alright so here i start with my basic
13:08 - spaceship core
13:09 - then i've got all the buttons down here
13:11 - for the various ship parts that i can
13:12 - add
13:13 - so i can just click and drag the mouse
13:15 - in order to place them anywhere i want
13:17 - and as soon as i drop them there's a
13:18 - nice visual connector connecting them to
13:20 - the ship and of course each part is a
13:22 - different thing so over here for the
13:23 - thrusters they provide some thrust so i
13:25 - want one up here and i want it to push
13:28 - upwards
13:28 - so i can click to select the object and
13:30 - over here on the window i can re-bind to
13:32 - any key so this one i want to point out
13:33 - so let's apply it to w
13:35 - then let's drag another thruster maybe
13:37 - in there and maybe one there using the
13:39 - mouse wheel i can rotate the selected
13:41 - object so put it just like this for this
13:43 - one i want to go left so bind it to a
13:45 - this one bind it to d
13:47 - now for some offensive abilities let's
13:49 - add two cannons so over here on the
13:51 - cannon just click and drag let's place
13:52 - them in there and let's also add two
13:55 - lasers okay so here's my very basic ship
13:58 - let's hit on play and if there it is i
14:00 - can move up down left right so i can
14:02 - control and by clicking i can shoot my
14:04 - lasers and my cannons at the same time
14:06 - so over there is an enemy and i can just
14:08 - shoot them and take them all down
14:10 - but now as my ship falls down i see that
14:12 - i'm stuck so i really need another
14:13 - thruster in there so i can press a
14:15 - button to go back into edit mode
14:17 - now i can place another thruster put it
14:19 - up there and for this one let's bind it
14:21 - to an s and there you go now if i
14:23 - accidentally get flipped around i can
14:25 - still move okay now there are a bunch of
14:28 - enemies over there and i'm taking a lot
14:30 - of damage so i really should improve my
14:32 - ship so let's go back into edit mode and
14:34 - again the important part about this
14:36 - system is iterating upon your ship
14:37 - design so let's add some defense by
14:39 - placing down a bunch of shields so let's
14:42 - make them all activate with the space
14:43 - bar and of course if i accidentally
14:45 - place any of these anywhere i can just
14:47 - click and drag in order to move them
14:48 - around or i can simply delete each part
14:51 - another thing i can do is also press on
14:53 - the save button here and save it onto a
14:54 - phone so i can press on save now i quit
14:57 - the game and over here is my save phone
14:59 - as you can see just some simple json and
15:01 - i can play the game again here is my
15:03 - empty ship again now i click on load
15:05 - there you go the exact same ship so i
15:07 - can now hit on play and now with my
15:09 - cannons my lasers and my shields as well
15:11 - i can defend myself i can take down all
15:13 - the enemies
15:14 - and just do everything and complete the
15:16 - mission
15:17 - so here's the big one and just gotta
15:18 - shoot a bunch of things and there you go
15:20 - take them out
15:21 - all right awesome so here is the fully
15:23 - functioning ship constructor system you
15:26 - can download the project files to check
15:27 - out all the code for yourself and maybe
15:29 - build upon this and make some
15:30 - interesting prototypes
15:32 - thanks again to everyone who joined me
15:33 - on the live stream it was fun to build
15:35 - most of the system live on stream i only
15:37 - did a bit of work off stream so pretty
15:39 - much the entire building of this system
15:40 - is recorded you can see all of the
15:42 - recorded vods to see how long it took me
15:44 - took me about six hours to build all of
15:46 - this oh no i'm quite pleased with the
15:48 - result i'm thinking i might further
15:50 - expand upon this maybe make some more
15:52 - parts maybe add a few more energy system
15:54 - and maybe make this into a proper easy
15:56 - to use asset let me know in the comments
15:58 - if you'd be interested in something like
15:59 - that so basically a more polished more
16:02 - feature-rich version of this system
16:03 - alright so again thanks so much for
16:05 - watching i hope you enjoyed watching
16:07 - this video and watching the system be
16:08 - built so thanks again and i'll see you
