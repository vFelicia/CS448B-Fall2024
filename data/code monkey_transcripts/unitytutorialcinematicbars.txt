00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're going to make
00:03 - some cinematic bars to be use during
00:05 - cutscenes let's get started
00:09 - so let's make a very nice simple and
00:12 - clean class cinematic bars on top and
00:15 - bottom we're going to go into our canvas
00:18 - here create a empty game object and name
00:20 - it cinematic bars so here is my game
00:24 - object and expand it to occupy the
00:26 - entire canvas object okay great
00:29 - we're going to create our bars through
00:31 - code rather than adding game objects in
00:33 - here so to make it easier to copy paste
00:35 - the script into any project you want
00:37 - that way you can just drag the script
00:39 - into a new project and you don't have to
00:41 - setup all the game objects in here so
00:43 - we're going to create a new C sharp
00:45 - script and name it
00:46 - cinematic bars now in here on our
00:49 - private voice awake we are going to
00:52 - create both of our bars which will be
00:54 - we're going to store the rect transform
00:57 - for our top bar and our bottom bar so
01:01 - let's create a game object game object
01:04 - new game object let's call it the top
01:08 - bar and we're going to give it the image
01:11 - component which is in using Unity engine
01:16 - that you are then let's go into our game
01:20 - object that transform dot set our parent
01:23 - parent to be this transform and don't
01:26 - keep the world position okay let's grab
01:30 - our image component and set the color to
01:35 - black and let's store our reference game
01:40 - object kit component type right okay now
01:45 - we need to set up our anchors to make
01:47 - sure that our top bar is located on the
01:49 - top of this transform and stretch to the
01:52 - sides so to do that we're going to use
01:54 - the anchormen and Anchor Max values
01:57 - those values are vector to use with
01:58 - normalized position of the lower left
02:00 - and upper right corners so the anchor
02:06 - min is the normalized position of the
02:08 - lower left corner so in this case we're
02:10 - saying that the left corner is on the
02:12 - left side on the top the Anchor Max is
02:14 - the upper right corner which we're
02:16 - saying is on the right side and also on
02:17 - the top this way we can then go into our
02:20 - top bar and
02:21 - modify the size Delta and it will modify
02:24 - the bar starting from the top now copy
02:27 - paste this code to setup our bottom bar
02:30 - now the bottom bar instead of having the
02:33 - min and Max on one on the Y it's going
02:35 - to be a zero since we want to anchor it
02:38 - to the bottom of our screen okay so this
02:41 - code should now create two game objects
02:43 - one for the top bar one for the bottom
02:44 - bar and set the size of 300 which from
02:48 - the top bar will go from top to the
02:50 - middle and the bottom are from about the
02:52 - middle so let's go into our scene drag
02:55 - the script on to our cinematic bars and
02:58 - object and let's see we should be able
03:00 - to see two black bars one on top and one
03:03 - on bottom yep there you have it so as
03:05 - you can see this way it's very easy to
03:06 - copy/paste this script into any new
03:08 - project since we just need to drag our
03:10 - scripted and the script takes care of
03:12 - creating all the elements necessary ok
03:15 - so now let us set up some functions to
03:17 - show and hide our cinematic box so we're
03:20 - going to make a public void show and in
03:24 - order to show the information we need is
03:26 - a float for the target size of our bar
03:30 - so we can have multiple bar sizes and a
03:34 - float for the time to reach that target
03:36 - size so in our class we're going to have
03:39 - a private phone for our target size and
03:43 - we're also going to need a private float
03:45 - for the change size amount which is the
03:49 - amount the size down that won't change
03:50 - per second so in here we're going to
03:53 - first set our target size to the target
03:57 - size and then we're going to calculate
03:59 - the change size amount which won't be
04:02 - the difference between the target size
04:04 - and the top bar dot size Delta the top
04:09 - bar and bottom bar are gonna have the
04:11 - same size so we can just use one in here
04:14 - and divide it by the time we want it to
04:17 - take so it's not the dot one of course
04:19 - then since we have a function to show
04:21 - let's also have a function to hide this
04:26 - one will only take time since the target
04:28 - size is going to be zero so
04:30 - target size equals zero and change size
04:34 - amount it's going to be the same thing
04:37 - okay so let's set up the animation to
04:39 - change the size Delta to this target
04:42 - size so going to go into my private void
04:45 - update and then here I want to modify my
04:48 - size Delta from the bottom bar and the
04:50 - top bar based on the change size amount
04:53 - until it reaches target size so I'm
04:55 - going to have a vector Q for my size
04:57 - Delta which will have the top bar dot
05:00 - size Delta this is what we're going to
05:02 - modify so size Delta dot y was equals to
05:07 - change size amount x time down time and
05:11 - then I'm going to apply that to my cup
05:13 - bar dot size dollar and also my bottom
05:17 - bar dot size don't okay so the basics
05:21 - should now be working let's add some
05:23 - debug buttons to make sure that it is in
05:25 - fact working so I'm going to up here and
05:28 - using the code monkey utilities which is
05:31 - always you can grab for free from unity
05:32 - code monkey calm and I'm going to go
05:35 - into the CM debug class to create a
05:37 - button on the UI I'm going to place it
05:41 - slightly on the right side and the
05:44 - function that it will trigger we don't
05:47 - do a show say 300 and what's it's going
05:52 - to take 300 milliseconds to show that
05:54 - and let's say the text is show and add
05:58 - another button for high and
06:00 - hi okay so we should now have two
06:04 - buttons when we can click to show one to
06:06 - hide and when we click it we're going to
06:09 - set our target size calculate the change
06:12 - size amount based on the target size and
06:14 - the time we want to take and on update
06:17 - we are simply animating it towards our
06:19 - size Delta let's test it okay so here I
06:22 - am I have my two buttons and the bars
06:24 - are at their initial starting point
06:26 - which should actually be zero but we'll
06:27 - fix that later let's see if we can hide
06:29 - and there you go they're hidden and I
06:33 - can show but as you can see it kept
06:35 - going on forever because we did not set
06:37 - the stop okay so let's fix those issues
06:40 - first of all set the starting size Delta
06:42 - to zero and now in here we need to
06:44 - calculate when we have passed our target
06:47 - size so in here if the change size
06:50 - amount if it is positive then we're
06:53 - going to check if our size Delta dot Y
06:56 - if it surpassed our target size if a
07:00 - surpass then set the size Delta dot Y to
07:03 - our target so in order to stop the
07:07 - animation let's go up here and set up a
07:09 - private ball College is active so when
07:13 - we start the animations let's set that
07:15 - ball to true and here when we reach our
07:19 - target we're going to set that to false
07:21 - and we're only going to execute this
07:23 - code if is active is true okay and let's
07:29 - test out when the change size amount is
07:31 - negative so if it goes under our target
07:35 - size you set that to our target size and
07:38 - you stop the animation and then
07:39 - obviously you refresh based on the value
07:41 - that we have in here okay so let's test
07:44 - it out and everything should be working
07:45 - okay here's my scene the bars are not
07:48 - there by default that's great so I'm
07:50 - going to show them there you go took 300
07:53 - milliseconds to reach the target amount
07:55 - and I'm and there you go I can show I
07:58 - can hide and there you go and there you
08:01 - have it I can hide and show some
08:04 - cinematic bars so when you put this in
08:06 - conjunction with a camera zoomed
08:09 - and a specific cutscene animation you
08:12 - can see how you can create very nice
08:14 - cutscenes as always you can download the
08:16 - project files and utilities from unity
08:18 - code monkey comm if you have any
08:20 - questions post them in the comments and
08:21 - only my best answer them okay see you
08:24 - next time
