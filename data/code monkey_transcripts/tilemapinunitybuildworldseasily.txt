00:00 - in this video we're going to explore how
00:01 - to use the unity town up
00:03 - this is the built-in unity tool that
00:05 - helps you quickly and easily build
00:06 - worlds with town sprites
00:08 - let's begin
00:09 - [Music]
00:14 - okay so let's check out how the town map
00:16 - works now i've already covered the video
00:18 - previously
00:18 - on how to build a custom tile map so
00:21 - that one was built from scratch using a
00:23 - custom grid class
00:24 - so that one is great if you want to
00:26 - really dig into the code and really
00:28 - understand how the whole thing works
00:30 - but if all you want is a normal tile map
00:32 - then you can just use the built-in unity
00:34 - tile map
00:34 - so let's see how to use it over here is
00:37 - my basic empty scene
00:38 - so i have a character walking around
00:40 - just for fun alright so let's set up a
00:42 - towel map
00:43 - now the first thing you need is the 2d
00:45 - packages
00:46 - if you already created the project using
00:48 - the 2d template they should already be
00:50 - installed
00:50 - but if not you just go into window and
00:52 - open up the package manager
00:54 - and then here on the unity registry you
00:56 - just need to install the 2d packages
00:59 - so for this one we're going to need the
01:01 - 2d sprite
01:02 - so this is so we can edit our
01:04 - spreadsheet and then we're going to need
01:05 - the 2d tile map editor
01:07 - so make sure both those packages are
01:09 - installed then here we are in our nice
01:11 - empty scene
01:12 - so on the hierarchy just right click i'm
01:14 - going to create a new 2d object and
01:16 - let's make it a tile map
01:18 - so right away this creates a grid object
01:20 - and if you select it you can visually
01:22 - see the grid
01:23 - then over here you have some options so
01:25 - for example you can modify the size of
01:27 - each grid cell
01:28 - and then you can also modify the gap
01:30 - between each grid zone
01:31 - so you can really customize exactly the
01:33 - type of grid that you want so in this
01:34 - case let's leave everything a nice
01:36 - standard grid
01:37 - then you also have the cell layout so
01:40 - this means that the tile map supports
01:42 - both normal rectangular grids but also
01:44 - hexagon and izomatic grids
01:46 - and then the cell swizzle which has to
01:48 - do with converting coordinates so in
01:49 - most cases we'll just leave it at
01:51 - xyz okay so that's the grid object and
01:54 - then
01:54 - inside it you have the actual tile map
01:56 - object so over here you have the tile
01:58 - map component as well as the tile map
02:00 - render
02:00 - again with a bunch of options for
02:02 - setting the tile anchor setting the
02:04 - color
02:05 - setting a certain sorting order as well
02:07 - as the material used to render the tama
02:09 - so you can play around with all of these
02:10 - but for now let's leave it all at
02:11 - default
02:12 - now in order to start drawing our tile
02:14 - map let's go into window
02:16 - down here onto 2d and let's open up the
02:18 - tile palette
02:19 - now in this window is where we're going
02:21 - to define the palette containing all the
02:22 - sprites that we're going to use in our
02:24 - tile map
02:24 - so click on this button to create a new
02:26 - palette then give it a name
02:28 - let's say our tile map palette and let's
02:31 - set it to use a rectangular grid
02:33 - and for the cell size leave it as
02:34 - automatic all right so click on create
02:37 - then it's going to ask you for a folder
02:39 - where it will save all the sprite data
02:41 - so just make a nice new folder in order
02:42 - to keep it organized
02:44 - so for the time palette and yep over
02:47 - here on the project files we can see we
02:49 - created a new folder
02:50 - and in there we have our nice object all
02:52 - right so now here as it says just drag
02:54 - the tile sprite or texture assets in
02:56 - here
02:56 - but before we do that we need to first
02:58 - prepare our spreadsheet so over here in
03:00 - the project files i already have a nice
03:02 - texture
03:03 - so it's a pretty simple sprite sheet
03:04 - with some background textures as well as
03:06 - some objects
03:07 - so this is the same sprite sheet that i
03:09 - use in the complete visual scripting
03:11 - course that i'm currently working on
03:12 - one of the games is an action rpg where
03:14 - i only use the tile map in order to
03:16 - build the world
03:17 - so check the link in the description if
03:18 - you're interested in that course
03:20 - now the first thing we need here is to
03:21 - slice the sprite sheet into its various
03:23 - sprites
03:24 - so up here on the sprite mode change
03:26 - from single into multiple
03:27 - then on the pixels per unit make sure
03:29 - you select the correct size
03:31 - now here my texture is 248 by 2048 so
03:34 - each of these grids is 512x5 tone
03:36 - so in here just put 512 that means that
03:39 - this whole thing will occupy only one
03:40 - unit in the world
03:42 - alright so do that then hit on apply and
03:44 - then click here on the sprite
03:46 - editor so here's our sprite and we can
03:48 - click on the slice menu
03:49 - and now in here depending on how you set
03:51 - up your spreadsheet
03:52 - if everything is nicely separated then
03:54 - you can go with automatic
03:56 - but in my case that wouldn't work since
03:57 - i have objects of different sizes
03:59 - so i'm instead going to select grid by
04:01 - cell size
04:02 - let's put each cell is 5 12 by 5 12 and
04:06 - just slice
04:07 - and there you go right away everything
04:08 - is nicely sliced so there's one here one
04:10 - here one here and so on
04:12 - now i'm just going to fix these smaller
04:13 - ones
04:19 - all right so everything is good now just
04:20 - go over here and hit apply
04:22 - and right away in the project files if
04:23 - we expand our texture yep we can see
04:25 - that it individually created all of our
04:26 - sprites so there you go down down and so
04:29 - on everything looks good
04:30 - all right now all we need to do is take
04:32 - this texture object
04:34 - so just click on it and drag it right
04:35 - here onto the tile palette
04:37 - and again make another folder
04:41 - and yep there it is we can now see all
04:43 - of our individual sprites in the town
04:45 - palette
04:45 - now up here we have these buttons so we
04:48 - can select move paint arrays and so on
04:50 - and in order to draw our tongues the
04:52 - simplest one is just to click on the
04:54 - paint button
04:55 - then you click to select the tile let's
04:56 - say this one so click on it
04:58 - and then just in the world just click
05:00 - and drag and start painting
05:03 - by the way a simple quick tip just when
05:04 - you have the scene window selected
05:07 - hit shift space and put it on full
05:09 - screen and now you got a bit more space
05:11 - alright so we can use this button in
05:12 - order to paint individual tiles
05:14 - you can use this one in order to draw on
05:16 - a rectangular area
05:18 - and you have this one in order to erase
05:20 - various tiles
05:21 - and you can also select and then click
05:23 - the move and then move it around
05:25 - then as for hotkeys for example while
05:27 - you are in paint mode
05:29 - there it goes like this one and now i'm
05:30 - painting then select different one and
05:33 - paint it
05:33 - now if i want i can hold down shift and
05:35 - click and drag in order to delete
05:37 - and i can hold down control in order to
05:39 - click and select this one so select this
05:41 - one paint this one then click
05:42 - control and yep paint this one alright
05:45 - so that's the super basic tile map setup
05:47 - let me just make a basic looking map
05:59 - all right so here's my basic world now
06:01 - one thing you might notice
06:02 - depending on how you drew the sprite
06:03 - sheet is some gaps so over here you can
06:05 - see
06:06 - a little line there and there and
06:07 - especially if we zoom in yep there you
06:09 - go there's a very big line there
06:10 - so the solution to solve this is to make
06:12 - a sprite atlas
06:13 - so right here on the project files let's
06:15 - right click go into create
06:17 - and create a new sprite atlas
06:20 - and now here in the inspector you can
06:22 - see the objects for packing
06:24 - so click on the plus icon and then
06:27 - either select individually eat sprite
06:29 - or select the whole texture and then if
06:31 - you want you can play around all the
06:32 - other settings or just leave them
06:34 - at default and you can click on pack
06:36 - preview and now if we look in the game
06:38 - view we can still see there are some
06:39 - gaps
06:40 - so that's because the sprite atlas is
06:42 - only created when you actually run the
06:43 - build
06:44 - so if we try to run the game and if
06:46 - there you go there are no more gaps and
06:48 - everything looks great
06:49 - all right so far so good now another
06:51 - thing you can have in a town map is
06:53 - layers so over here we see we have the
06:55 - word object and then inside we have the
06:57 - tile map
06:58 - so it's in here that you can have
06:59 - multiple so rename this to the tile map
07:01 - background
07:02 - and then let's duplicate this one and
07:04 - named it the tile map over
07:06 - now when you do that it also duplicates
07:08 - the tiles that were already in there
07:10 - so for example if i move this tile map
07:12 - people you can see it has the same tiles
07:14 - now i want this one to have the objects
07:15 - that are going to be placed on top of
07:17 - the background
07:18 - so just erase all these in order to
07:20 - select on which tile map you are
07:22 - actually painting on
07:23 - you have in here the drop down menu for
07:25 - the active tile map so in this case i
07:27 - want to erase this one on the over tile
07:28 - map so just select that one
07:30 - and now if i click yeah there you go now
07:32 - i'm erasing this one
07:34 - and by the way if you select on control
07:36 - then you can have a bigger
07:37 - brush area so just select control select
07:40 - the whole thing and now i can erase
07:41 - everything with just one click
07:43 - all right so the overtime map is now
07:44 - empty and just reset it back on zero
07:46 - zero
07:47 - so everything is nicely positioned okay
07:49 - now we want to place some things on this
07:51 - time map that will show up on top of the
07:53 - previous one
07:54 - so on each tile map you can see the
07:55 - tilemap printer and in here you have the
07:58 - sorting layer as well as the sorting
07:59 - order so in this case let's leave the
08:01 - base one on default at zero and this one
08:03 - is meant to be on top so just put it on
08:04 - 10.
08:05 - so now if i place down some objects so
08:07 - let's say i want to print
08:09 - this little tree trunk and if there you
08:11 - go gets placed in there
08:12 - so now i want to place some of these and
08:14 - there you go i can place them
08:16 - so we now have one tama being painted on
08:18 - top of another one
08:19 - however we want this one to be in
08:21 - between the other tones so i want to
08:23 - place the sprite in between those two
08:24 - edges
08:25 - now to do that there is essentially two
08:27 - approaches so we can just move the
08:29 - time-lapse object so just move it by
08:31 - 0.5 and 0.5 and there you go now it's
08:33 - offset on each corner
08:35 - and another potential approach is to
08:36 - modify over here the tile anchor
08:38 - so at 0.5 they are being anchored in the
08:40 - center and if i put at 0 0 then they're
08:42 - now at the bottom yep just like that
08:44 - so you have those two options in this
08:46 - case let's leave the anchor at that
08:48 - and just slightly offset the tile map
08:50 - object okay so now i can place the
08:51 - sprite in between the edges
08:53 - just like that i can also place a bunch
08:55 - of other objects so there you go a
08:57 - couple of bushes
08:58 - a couple of tree trunks and so on now
09:00 - another thing you can do is modify the
09:02 - tile palette
09:03 - so over here you have a button for edit
09:05 - so click on it and now we are in edit
09:07 - mode
09:07 - so while in edit mode select the paint
09:09 - brush then control click on the one that
09:12 - we want to copy so control click
09:14 - and then let's make four of them in here
09:16 - then also control click on this one and
09:17 - make another one there
09:19 - all right so now with the select tool
09:20 - select this one and now rotate this one
09:23 - by 90 degrees
09:24 - and this one by 180 and this one by 270.
09:28 - all right so we have all these rotated
09:30 - ones and for this one rotate by 90.
09:32 - all right so there it is save the tile
09:35 - palette exit
09:36 - edit mode and now we have all these nice
09:38 - rotated sprites
09:39 - so if i want i can now perfectly place
09:41 - these ones
09:43 - see if there you go just like that
09:48 - by the way another thing you can do is
09:50 - also play around with the pivot for each
09:52 - object
09:53 - so for example on the tree trunk you can
09:55 - go into the texture go into the sprite
09:57 - editor
09:58 - here is the tree trunk and instead of
10:00 - having the pivot down middle let's move
10:01 - it down in there
10:03 - and hit apply and there you go they all
10:04 - moved automatically so you can modify
10:06 - the pivot of where the thing gets placed
10:08 - and lastly you also have options for
10:10 - scaling the tiles
10:12 - so with the select tool select each tile
10:13 - and then for example modify the scale
10:15 - 222
10:17 - and now if i try to paint this there you
10:19 - go now it paints it much bigger
10:20 - so you can really play around with any
10:22 - object on the palette now with regards
10:23 - to scaling for example i have these four
10:25 - objects which are meant to be smaller
10:26 - than one grid position
10:28 - so if i try to place the pillar right
10:30 - here that's a bit bigger i don't want it
10:31 - to be that big
10:32 - so again i can click here in order to
10:34 - modify the scale put it that much
10:36 - smaller
10:37 - and now if i try to paint it yep there
10:38 - you go it is much smaller so this works
10:40 - but this really only scales the sprites
10:42 - so the grid size is still the same so i
10:44 - cannot put them right next to each other
10:46 - so another approach is to make a brand
10:47 - new grid and set the cell size to be
10:49 - smart
10:50 - so right click create the brand new tile
10:52 - map
10:53 - which creates a new grid as well as new
10:55 - tile map so let's rename this to the
10:57 - town map details
10:59 - and on the grid itself over here we can
11:01 - modify the cell size so let's say
11:02 - 0.5 so we have this main grid and then
11:05 - we have this smaller grid
11:07 - and now in here with this active tile
11:09 - map selected i can place down these
11:10 - objects right like this
11:22 - all right so here's our world map
11:23 - composed of a background then some
11:25 - objects on top and then some smaller
11:27 - details
11:32 - now just one last thing regarding time
11:34 - maps which is adding colliders
11:35 - so for example i want these objects to
11:37 - be fully solid
11:39 - for that i'm just going to duplicate
11:41 - this time map and name this the
11:42 - town map colliders
11:48 - and then all we need to do is add the
11:50 - component of the tile map collider
11:52 - so just do that and yep it adds letters
11:54 - to all the objects so on this one just
11:55 - erase all the ones that are not the
11:57 - pillars
11:58 - so just in here erase and get rid of all
12:08 - those
12:10 - all right so i erased all the objects
12:11 - except for the pillars
12:13 - and now the character controller is
12:15 - already testing for collisions so if i
12:17 - play
12:18 - so here's my character and i can walk
12:20 - around normally and if i go towards the
12:21 - pillars no can do it can't go through
12:23 - them
12:26 - so that's how simple it is to add
12:27 - collisions onto your tile map
12:29 - and this also shows how easy it is to
12:31 - use the tile map when making a
12:33 - platformer game
12:34 - so you could draw the world using the
12:36 - town map and then just add the time map
12:37 - collector and all of a sudden
12:39 - you have platform collisions alright so
12:41 - now you know how to use the built-in
12:42 - unity tama
12:43 - it's a very versatile tool that you can
12:45 - use to build massive worlds very easily
12:47 - and if you want to see how you could
12:48 - make a custom town map from scratch go
12:50 - watch that other video
12:52 - that one is based on the grid class made
12:53 - previously which is very versatile and
12:55 - you can make it perfectly fit your needs
12:57 - but for simple cases the built-in unity
12:59 - time map is excellent and very easy to
13:01 - use
13:01 - now like i said the sprite sheet i'm
13:02 - using here is from the complete visual
13:04 - scripting course that i'm currently
13:05 - working on
13:06 - one of the games is an action rpg where
13:08 - i will use the tile map in order to
13:09 - build the world
