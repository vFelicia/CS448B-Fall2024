00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and the time has finally arrived I've
00:04 - been waiting for this moment for years
00:05 - and now it's finally here Unity dots has
00:07 - been officially released so look at this
00:09 - awesome thing here I have Unity 22 LTS
00:12 - with dots and sound do you notice
00:14 - anything different the answer is on the
00:16 - top right corner the preview packages
00:18 - warning they used to be there is gone
00:19 - because of the dots packages they are
00:21 - now phone production ready it has been
00:23 - five years since dots was announced all
00:25 - the way back in 2018 after lots of work
00:27 - lots of iteration it's awesome that we
00:29 - have finally reached production ready
00:30 - I'd like to say congrats to everyone on
00:32 - the unity dots theme for getting this
00:34 - far this was a massive undertaking it's
00:36 - a completely different way of making
00:37 - games which will enable so many possible
00:39 - scenarios but while it is completely
00:41 - different it also integrates very well
00:43 - with the regular game object workflow so
00:45 - keep that in mind you don't have to go
00:46 - full dots or full game objects you can
00:48 - mix them both so that means keep using
00:50 - Game objects for regular stuff and then
00:52 - dive into dots for really performance
00:54 - intensive applications with 1.0 Out
00:56 - means that you can now safely start
00:58 - using it in your own projects and at the
01:00 - same time this is really just the
01:02 - beginning now that the core is nice and
01:03 - stable we will start to see dots be
01:05 - implemented into all kinds of back-end
01:07 - tools for example the 2D ik package has
01:09 - already benefited from the burst
01:11 - compiler so even if you don't directly
01:13 - use entities you will still be
01:15 - benefiting from this deck so this is
01:16 - really awesome I'm definitely very
01:18 - excited for the future that to me is the
01:20 - biggest feature of unity 22lts which is
01:22 - out right now but there's tons more
01:24 - stuff this is their long-term support
01:26 - version which is the version you should
01:27 - be using most the time it has the most
01:29 - stability and the fact that dots is out
01:31 - now in this version means you can expect
01:33 - dots to be stable I did a really
01:35 - detailed tutorial a few months ago when
01:36 - version 1.0 was out in preview now I
01:39 - need to get back to it and research to
01:40 - see what has changed since then I've
01:42 - been waiting for years to really dive
01:43 - deep into dots I was waiting for 1.0 to
01:46 - be stable so I can start making tons of
01:47 - videos that won't be updated in a few
01:49 - weeks so I definitely want to do that
01:51 - perhaps a mini course on making a fun
01:53 - dots project but at the same time right
01:54 - now I'm actually currently super busy
01:56 - working on my steam game dinky Guardians
01:58 - go ahead and edit your wishlist so so
02:00 - it's kind of a bit tricky to find the
02:02 - time but I'll try my best to at least do
02:03 - a quick intro on dots 1.0 Beyond dots
02:06 - Unity sponsored this video to let you
02:07 - know about all of the awesome additions
02:09 - in version 22 onts which has just
02:11 - released there's also going to be a
02:13 - multi-hour live stream on the 22nd
02:14 - covering all about the 22 LTS version
02:16 - you can sign up with the link in the
02:18 - description so on this version also
02:20 - related to dots is the net code for
02:22 - entities package this is their
02:23 - networking Library based on entities you
02:25 - might know all about netcode for him
02:27 - objects I made a phone free course on
02:29 - making multiplayer games using that
02:30 - onset so NGO that one is primarily meant
02:33 - for small scale co-op games whereas
02:35 - netcode for entities this one is meant
02:36 - to support really super fast paced super
02:39 - optimized games so things like
02:40 - fast-paced Shooters kind of like Apex
02:42 - Legends that's the kind of thing that
02:44 - netcode for entities is perfect for so
02:46 - super fast latency or really intense
02:48 - multiplayer games with tons of network
02:50 - objects all of them all over the place
02:51 - and of course this one is just a
02:53 - networking layer so on top of netcode
02:55 - for entities you can use all of the
02:57 - other Unity multiplayer tools just like
02:59 - you can use them in netcode for game
03:01 - objects so you can add Lobby you can add
03:03 - relay you can Implement Matchmaker or
03:05 - game server hosting all of that can work
03:07 - with that netcode for game objects or
03:09 - netcode for entities then Unity agrp
03:11 - continues to push visual Fidelity to the
03:13 - max now for me I normally just stick
03:15 - with urp but looking at these updates
03:17 - really makes me want to use a little bit
03:18 - of egrp you can now create some really
03:20 - awesome looking volumetric fog and
03:22 - volumetric materials making something
03:24 - volumetric always makes them look really
03:26 - excellent the new water system is also
03:28 - extremely impressive you can create
03:29 - oceans or rivers and make them look
03:31 - really stunning it features some
03:33 - realistic waves with Ripples and foam
03:35 - also has some really nice underwater
03:36 - caustics some reflection and refraction
03:38 - so tons and tons of features another
03:41 - awesome volumetric feature are the new
03:42 - Cloud layers they look extremely
03:45 - realistic they block the light just like
03:46 - you expect you can easily and smoothly
03:48 - transition from nice and sunny to dark
03:50 - and cloudy this is one feature that
03:52 - really helps set the mood for your game
03:53 - looking at all of these awesome tools
03:55 - really makes me wish urp had these
03:57 - features as well technically for an
03:58 - alternative to the water system you can
04:00 - pick up the water Shader from the boat
04:02 - attack demo that one also looks great
04:04 - and for volumetric fog they have it on
04:06 - their private board as under
04:07 - consideration so if you'd like it to
04:09 - have that then go on to that page and
04:10 - vote for it although personally on that
04:12 - page I'm much more interested in screen
04:14 - space Reflections I think this is
04:15 - something the engine would really
04:16 - benefit from but now let's take a look
04:18 - at what urp got in this latest version
04:20 - because it still did get lots of awesome
04:22 - stuff one big one is forward plus
04:24 - rendering which eliminates the
04:25 - enlightened limit so you can have as
04:27 - many lights as you want this is really
04:29 - useful especially for Big scenes where
04:30 - you want to use real-time lights and
04:32 - don't want to be limited to just a
04:33 - handphone my question on this is of
04:35 - course what kind of performance does
04:36 - this bring I really hope it's not a big
04:38 - hit another great but very invisible
04:40 - addition is LOD Crossfade if you've
04:43 - played any game then you've certainly
04:44 - seen some models change drastically
04:46 - which can really ruin the immersion only
04:48 - Crossfade makes that change almost
04:49 - invisible this allows you to have many
04:51 - more lods which in turn makes your game
04:53 - much more performant whilst not
04:54 - suffering from that janky visual
04:56 - stuttering like I said it's a very
04:57 - invisible addition but definitely a very
04:59 - important one then they have also added
05:01 - support for temporal anti-aliasing
05:03 - basically this uses the camera motion
05:04 - vectors to smooth out the changes over
05:06 - time this is especially noticeable in
05:08 - dark scenes with lights with other
05:10 - techniques you can sometimes see the
05:11 - lights flickering whereas when using TAA
05:14 - that really helps solve that by taking
05:15 - the previous frames into account which
05:17 - makes the end results look really nice
05:19 - and smooth another awesome highly
05:21 - requested feature is the count layers
05:22 - decals are a great way to add a lot more
05:24 - light to your levels by placing down
05:26 - some blood splatter or maybe some bullet
05:28 - holes or just Place coins everywhere in
05:30 - your level and now you can use decal
05:31 - layers to make sure the decals only
05:33 - apply to the objects you want so you no
05:34 - longer have issues with the character
05:36 - being hit by the decal another really
05:38 - awesome one that I've wanted to use for
05:39 - quite some time is the ShadowCraft full
05:41 - screen masternode previously in order to
05:43 - do full screen effects with shade graph
05:45 - it required some very weird hacks but
05:47 - now it's super easy you just change the
05:49 - master node and you can easily use the
05:51 - entire power of Shader graph to make
05:52 - some really awesome full screen effects
05:54 - so you can now easily make effects like
05:55 - wobbling the screen make the solve make
05:57 - a zoom paint it red really anything you
06:00 - could do with ShadowCraft like for
06:01 - example all the various tutorials that I
06:02 - covered in my playlist of that you can
06:04 - now do as a full screen effect which is
06:06 - really awesome then some more additions
06:08 - they added Shader variant pre-filtering
06:10 - this one improves build times which is
06:11 - always great for improving iteration
06:13 - speed especially on consoles and mobile
06:14 - and the built-in converter also got some
06:17 - upgrades to make it easier to upgrade
06:18 - from a previous project another really
06:20 - awesome tool is the splines package now
06:22 - I looked at this one when it first came
06:24 - out and it was super basic but looking
06:26 - at it right now they have added a
06:28 - massive amount of features it's really
06:29 - impressive with so many use cases you
06:31 - can easily create and position splines
06:33 - you can add new points anywhere in the
06:35 - curve in any way you want the contextual
06:37 - tools make it really easy to modify any
06:39 - point in any way you want you can parent
06:41 - the splines you can create various
06:43 - branches and really do anything you can
06:45 - think of then using that spline shape
06:46 - you can add some components on top to do
06:48 - things like spawn a prefab along the
06:50 - spline or perhaps extrude the mesh to
06:52 - make some pipes or some roads or maybe
06:54 - animate an object along the spline so
06:56 - really tons of possible use cases and
06:58 - the API is also nice and exposed so you
07:00 - can build your own tools on top of this
07:01 - there's no need to build your own spline
07:03 - package honestly I'm really impressed
07:05 - with this one I hadn't looked at it
07:06 - since release and it's amazing how far
07:08 - it's come then another core pillar of
07:10 - unity is just how many platforms it
07:11 - supports whatever you build with unity
07:13 - you can make a build for whatever device
07:15 - exists in the world that can be mobile
07:17 - console desktop XR it's really amazing
07:20 - how Unity supports so many platforms you
07:22 - just build your game once and you can
07:24 - put it anywhere now for Windows and Xbox
07:25 - they have added improvements to dx12
07:28 - this one of those things where it's
07:29 - always great to have an option to just
07:31 - flip a switch and immediately get free
07:32 - performance then they also added Ray
07:34 - tracing support for Xbox series X and S
07:36 - and PS5 so if your game is pushing
07:38 - visuals to its limits and this is
07:40 - definitely something you can now add the
07:41 - incremental player build process this
07:43 - one has also been really useful
07:45 - personally I've experienced this myself
07:46 - when I was making the multiplayer course
07:48 - which did require making tons of builds
07:50 - usually making a build would take some
07:52 - like 30 seconds to maybe a minute
07:53 - whereas now thanks to this one it was
07:55 - really awesome to be able to make a
07:56 - build and test in about 5-10 seconds
07:58 - again iteration speed is so important in
08:00 - Game Dev so this feature this one is
08:02 - really awesome for Android games there's
08:04 - now a package from arm to help you
08:06 - access some low level data for Samsung
08:08 - phones you can now use adaptive
08:10 - performance with support for visual
08:11 - scripting and something that I didn't
08:13 - even know was possible is webgl
08:14 - apparently now supports native C plus
08:16 - plus multi-threading I I'm not too
08:18 - familiar with this area but this seems
08:19 - insane to me webgl always has
08:22 - performance issues so with this with
08:23 - multi-threading I wonder just how big
08:25 - this is going to be and of course if
08:27 - you're into XR they made tons of
08:28 - improvements to their XR interaction
08:30 - token I have to say XR is a topic that
08:32 - I've been meaning to look at for a long
08:33 - time it's a very interesting space and
08:35 - it might be about to blow up if Apple
08:37 - does indeed announce their device soon
08:39 - so this one area that I really need to
08:41 - find the time to research and that's the
08:42 - general highlights for this Unity 21ts
08:45 - version again the onts is the most
08:46 - stable version so it's one you probably
08:48 - should be using in most cases even if
08:50 - you're making just a game Jam I would
08:51 - probably still use this version unless
08:52 - there's something specific you need that
08:54 - only exists on the next version of
08:56 - course this version is what I'm using
08:57 - for my steam game which I'm planning to
08:59 - launch in two months you want to always
09:00 - be using the LTS version for maximum
09:02 - stability when you release something
09:03 - this version is supported for two years
09:05 - and going back to the beginning with
09:07 - this release with dots with that one
09:09 - finally being production ready after so
09:10 - many years that means you can now expect
09:12 - it to be stable and you can start to use
09:14 - it in your own project with confidence
09:16 - as for me I definitely want to dive deep
09:18 - into dots I just need to find the time
09:19 - to research it while also continuing to
09:21 - work on my game let me know in the
09:23 - comments any specific dots content you'd
09:24 - like to see I'd like to look into making
09:26 - perhaps a Basics video just going over
09:28 - the Core Concepts then perhaps one
09:30 - exploring some Acer pathfinding with
09:31 - dots just like I did in a long time ago
09:33 - or perhaps convert some of my games to
09:35 - dots I've definitely got tons of ideas
09:37 - but you'll let me know what you would
09:39 - like to see now if you want to learn
09:40 - more about the 22 LTS version check the
09:42 - link in the description you can check
09:43 - out the roadmap they present at gdc23
09:46 - and there's going to be a multi-hour
09:47 - live stream on the 22nd so definitely
09:49 - check that out for a deeper dive into
09:51 - all of these tools alright hope that's
09:53 - useful check out these videos to learn
09:55 - some more thanks to these awesome
09:57 - patreon supporters for making these
09:58 - videos possible thank you for watching
10:00 - and I'll see you next time
10:04 - foreign
