00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - and here's an unexpected nice surprise
00:04 - Unity 6 preview is now available I was
00:06 - waiting for this one for one specific
00:07 - reason I'll mention what that is in a
00:08 - little bit but before that apologies for
00:10 - my voice I've been sick all week which
00:12 - is pretty annoying I was planning to
00:13 - record a bunch of videos and doing a
00:15 - live stream but I couldn't do any of
00:16 - that and in this video I also finally
00:18 - wanted to try out some of these new
00:19 - features but in order to not mess up my
00:21 - throat too much this is just going to be
00:22 - a quick news video anyways like I said
00:24 - Unity 6 preview is out right now I
00:26 - thought this was still months away so
00:27 - this is awesome the reason why I was
00:29 - looking forward to this version is
00:30 - because in terms of features this has
00:32 - everything inside of unity 6 they talked
00:34 - about their new naming scheme a while
00:35 - ago now they have beta preview and then
00:37 - full release so beta is normally
00:40 - naturally quite unstable so normally
00:41 - personally I don't touch the beta
00:43 - versions unless I want to explore some
00:44 - specific feature then there's preview
00:46 - which is what we have right now this one
00:47 - is considered mostly stable and contains
00:49 - all the features that won't be in the
00:50 - final version and finally the full LTS
00:53 - version this one is usually the one you
00:54 - should be using for your final games I'm
00:56 - guessing this one willon be out around
00:57 - September that's when they have their
00:59 - Unite conference and I'm guessing the
01:01 - version won't be out by then so anyways
01:02 - preview which is out right now means it
01:03 - has all those features so that means all
01:05 - those really awesome graphics features
01:07 - like the GPU resent drawer literally
01:09 - just toggle the checkbox and everything
01:10 - runs much faster then it's also got GPU
01:13 - occlusion calling this one use the GPU
01:15 - in order to be able to render much fewer
01:16 - things if you got spatial tempor on post
01:18 - processing this is sort of their
01:19 - upscaler which makes the game Run much
01:21 - faster at a lower frame rate without any
01:23 - visual difference then you've got the
01:24 - render graph viewer to be able to see
01:26 - exactly how your frame is being rendered
01:27 - you've got 48 rendering if you're making
01:29 - some kind of VR application you can now
01:31 - much more easily make custom Pro
01:32 - frosting effects and even work directly
01:34 - with the volume framework you can
01:35 - finally try out adaptive Pro volumes
01:37 - this is one of the main ones that I'm
01:39 - really looking for it lets you do some
01:40 - really gorgeous natural glob
01:41 - illumination you can generate some
01:43 - really gorgeous lighting and then easily
01:44 - swap between them for AG grp you've got
01:46 - some really gorgeous atmospheric
01:48 - scattering that water system is also
01:49 - continually getting a bunch of
01:50 - improvements there's some very useful
01:52 - new VFX gra tools shed graph also get
01:54 - some nice interesting things you can now
01:56 - easily create some build profiles make
01:58 - mobile games that run the web and more
02:00 - things including a bunch of multiplayer
02:01 - tools like multiplayer play mode this
02:03 - one I think is going to be super useful
02:05 - then you've got distributed Authority
02:06 - more improvements for netod for enties
02:08 - that cated server and a bunch more so
02:10 - with all this un6 does look like one of
02:11 - the biggest jumps in versions and I was
02:13 - specifically waiting for this version
02:14 - for one very specific thing for a long
02:16 - time now people have been asking me to
02:17 - do a complete step-by-step dots course
02:19 - and I was waiting for this version
02:21 - before I started researching that since
02:22 - that course is on dots I want to use the
02:24 - latest version possible so I will be
02:25 - using the latest dots version and the
02:27 - unity 6 preview version hopefully that
02:29 - means the course will stay up to date
02:31 - for a really nice long time I've started
02:32 - doing some research I've been playing
02:34 - they are billions great game the design
02:36 - that I'm going for will be similar to
02:37 - that meaning RTS with lots of units and
02:40 - City Builder and defense elements like I
02:41 - said I'm still in the very early stages
02:43 - of planning but I have set up a page
02:44 - where you can sign up with your email
02:46 - and I'll let you know when it's ready so
02:47 - if you want to learn how to use dots in
02:49 - a complete project as a guided
02:50 - step-by-step course then check out the
02:52 - link in the description to sign up
02:53 - that's my personal reason for waiting
02:55 - for this specific Unity version but like
02:57 - I said Unity 6 is a
02:58 - preivew about these features for quite a
03:01 - while now they mentioned them last year
03:02 - at unite and a few months ago at GDC so
03:04 - if you're a regular on my channel then
03:06 - this will all be mostly familiar to you
03:08 - the main difference is now that really
03:09 - just the fact that the preview version
03:11 - is out so if you like me also don't
03:13 - normally touch the beta versions then
03:15 - now is the time to finally explore all
03:16 - of these nice new features if you're
03:18 - working on a project and you're going to
03:19 - release it in the next few months then
03:20 - keep using whatever version you're using
03:22 - likely the 22 LTS version that's the
03:24 - main version that I've been using in
03:25 - pretty much all my projects for about a
03:27 - year now but if you're at least 6 months
03:29 - away from releas or if you like me want
03:31 - to explore these new features then now
03:32 - is a great time to install Unity 6 and
03:34 - try it out I've already installed it
03:36 - myself this is going to be my main
03:37 - version that I'm going to use going
03:38 - forward I'm definitely curious to
03:39 - explore all these new features
03:41 - especially seeing just how big a
03:42 - difference it actually is to enable all
03:44 - of these graphical checkboxes so
03:46 - definitely stay tuned for some videos
03:47 - covering that and if you're interested
03:48 - in learning how to make a complete Game
03:50 - using D dots then check the link and
03:51 - sign up I'm hard at work researching and
03:53 - planning for that course and I'm really
03:54 - excited to finally use dots in a nice
03:56 - complete project all right so I'm going
03:58 - to go try to rest a bit now I hope
04:00 - you've been having a better week than me
04:01 - hopefully I'll be back to normal
04:03 - tomorrow to be able to do the normal
04:04 - private member live streams so thanks
04:06 - for watching and I'll see you next time
