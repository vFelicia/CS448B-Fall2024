01:06 - things looking at this one really makes
01:08 - me want to make a quick prototype just
01:10 - like that just imagine a player up there

01:15 - thanks to the awesome multiplayer tools
01:16 - that exist nowadays building something
01:18 - like that is actually surprisingly easy
01:20 - or if you need a tool to help you
01:22 - populate your world with some prefabs
01:23 - check out this one there's a bunch of
01:25 - these prefab placement tools this one
01:27 - seems very capable and again this is
01:29 - free this this one is the free version
01:30 - of a pay tool it appears that the only
01:33 - difference is that it has the unlimited
01:34 - number of brushes so it should still be
01:36 - great to try it out and easily populate
01:38 - an entire world then if you need a fun
01:40 - cartoony ghost character check out this
01:42 - one it's a really nice really cute
01:44 - character this could be your player or
01:46 - could be some kind of enemy if you like
01:48 - this cute cartoony style then this dev
01:50 - has tons more stuff or maybe if you need
01:52 - some foliage to make your worlds feel
01:54 - much more alive check out this one it's
01:56 - some nice foliage shaders it includes
01:58 - various examples alongside tons of
02:00 - parameters and Shader nodes that you can
02:01 - play with you can modify almost anything
02:04 - to get it looking exactly the way you
02:05 - want it this one also has a win system
02:08 - and featur some translucency this is
02:09 - some great looking foliage definitely go
02:11 - ahead and try adding something like this
02:13 - to your projects to see the massive
02:14 - difference that it makes then if you
02:17 - have curve paths in your world check out
02:19 - this tool you can generate meshes with
02:21 - curves and very easily animate the
02:22 - visual it features lots of gizmos that
02:24 - you can easily drag to get the exact
02:26 - shape that you want you can easily add
02:28 - or remove points you can move objects at
02:30 - a consistent speed alongside the spine
02:33 - there are plenty of these tools and this
02:34 - one seems pretty great if you want to
02:36 - learn how a tool like this actually
02:37 - works then you can go watch my spline
02:39 - tutorial then here's a bit of a strange
02:41 - tool it's for spawning objects that
02:44 - automatically move alongside the
02:45 - colliders in the world the example shown
02:47 - in the video is some kind of ants that
02:49 - are just moving all over the world they
02:51 - can climb any object even if that object
02:53 - is dynamic definitely a strange use case
02:56 - or perhaps a more standard use case
02:58 - simply positioning objects in in the
02:59 - world it automatically finds Solid
03:01 - Surfaces and places the objects then of
03:04 - course those objects can be somewhat
03:05 - randomized making them look more natural
03:07 - so this can also be a nice World
03:08 - building tool then if all you need is
03:10 - just a single anime character check out
03:12 - this one it's got a nice stylized Shader
03:15 - and the character proportions make it
03:16 - look quite anime likee this one is fully
03:18 - rigged so you can also easily animate it
03:20 - if you like this particular style then
03:22 - this dev has tons more and if you want a
03:24 - super quick and easy way to massively
03:26 - improve how your game looks one of the
03:28 - easiest things you can do is just using
03:30 - a custom Sky Box like on this pack this
03:32 - one features a dozen Sky Box so there
03:34 - are some really nice blue clean Skies
03:37 - there are some dark night skies some
03:39 - very cloudy some very clear and even
03:41 - some that look quite strange again
03:43 - change the Sky Box is really something
03:44 - super simple that will massively make
03:46 - your game feel much much better all
