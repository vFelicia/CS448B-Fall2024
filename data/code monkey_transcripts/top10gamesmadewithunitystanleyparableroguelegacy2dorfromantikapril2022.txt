00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made with unity for april 2022
00:06 - this month was really insane so many
00:08 - great games that were released for the
00:09 - first time and a bunch of them out of
00:10 - early access it was probably one of the
00:12 - toughest months to stick with just this
00:14 - list of 10 games normally these videos
00:16 - include one vr game but this month there
00:18 - were so many awesome regular games that
00:20 - i didn't include a single one for vr on
00:22 - the one hand this is great for players
00:24 - you've got tons of awesome games on all
00:26 - kinds of genres for you to play and
00:28 - enjoy
00:28 - but also it makes it very tricky for
00:30 - developers so all of these games are
00:32 - your competition so you really need to
00:34 - bring your best and have something truly
00:36 - unique if you want to stand out all of
00:38 - these games are uniquely impressive so
00:39 - the list is in no particular order
00:41 - except for the number one game that is
00:42 - my personal pick of the month also do
00:44 - you want to get hired for your unity or
00:46 - game dev skills check out talent at
00:48 - seriesgamejobs.com which is a new
00:50 - service where companies approach great
00:52 - candidates with offers it's easy to sign
00:54 - up and you can connect your existing
00:55 - linkedin or portfolio sites to show
00:57 - employers check it out with the link to
00:59 - get hired or to find talent alright so
01:01 - starting off at number 10 with what is
01:03 - considered to be one of the most unique
01:05 - games of all time which has just been
01:07 - remastered the stanley parable ultra
01:09 - deluxe i have to say i haven't played it
01:11 - yet it's always been on my list but i
01:13 - never got around to it one of the
01:15 - benefit of waiting so long before
01:16 - playing certain games is if you wait
01:18 - long enough the game gets remastered and
01:20 - it's better and with more content if
01:22 - you've never heard of it like i said
01:23 - it's an extremely unique game it's a
01:25 - story based comedy game with a very
01:27 - interesting design lots of things change
01:30 - everything is very mysterious and all of
01:31 - your choices matter
01:33 - it features an excellent narrator
01:35 - talking and correctly reacting to all of
01:37 - your choices basically if you want to be
01:39 - a good game designer and explore
01:41 - everything that games can be then this
01:42 - game is pretty much required to be
01:44 - studied and experienced
01:45 - so with that i really need to find time
01:47 - to go through it myself and this
01:48 - remaster seems like the perfect time to
01:50 - do it
01:51 - then here's a pretty unique one a card
01:53 - based village builder called stacklands
01:56 - it's a very unique merging of genres and
01:58 - based on the reviews that combination of
02:00 - those two genres really works
02:02 - you have cards representing all kinds of
02:04 - things in city builder games so you have
02:06 - villagers food research and so on
02:08 - by dragging cars on top of others you
02:10 - can then take special actions like for
02:12 - example drag a villager on top of a
02:14 - berry bush to start harvesting berries
02:16 - then you drag the berry card onto the
02:18 - villager in order to feed them the
02:19 - visuals are also great they're very
02:21 - chill very inviting with some satisfying
02:23 - sound effects also like other city
02:25 - builders you have some enemies which you
02:27 - must defend and find research cards to
02:29 - progress
02:30 - so all in all it's a really unique idea
02:32 - and at a pretty cheap price point and
02:34 - it's already got over 1500
02:36 - overwhelmingly positive reviews so it
02:38 - seems that people really like it this
02:39 - one is made by sock pop collective which
02:42 - is a group that has been building some
02:43 - tiny interesting games for quite a long
02:45 - time their steam bundle has 93 items and
02:48 - i think this one is their most
02:49 - successful one yet then if you're
02:51 - looking for a sandbox building game with
02:53 - a focus on nautical gameplay then check
02:55 - out sea of craft i especially love the
02:58 - building scene the water parts to give
03:00 - way to your construction area it's a
03:02 - simple effect but looks really awesome
03:03 - really unique there are plenty of
03:05 - sandbox builder games out there but most
03:07 - of those are on lan so this one brings
03:09 - something fresh to genre by keeping the
03:11 - gameplay mostly in the water that change
03:14 - is not just a visual change it has
03:15 - serious impacts in terms of physics
03:17 - buoyancy and much more
03:19 - although it also supports land buildings
03:21 - and even some buildings features lots of
03:23 - unique missions to complete explosive
03:25 - pvp battles and of course tons and tons
03:27 - of parts for you to use in building your
03:29 - ship so you can go ahead and build
03:31 - something peaceful or you add some
03:32 - cannons and a bunch of hammers
03:34 - then here's a very sunny very fun game
03:37 - nightfall a daring journey it's a
03:39 - medieval game but with guns and some
03:41 - horse drifting
03:42 - it's very silly but it doesn't look
03:44 - great it's made with co-op in mind with
03:46 - up to 24 players and teams of two you go
03:49 - from village to village drift your horse
03:51 - during the day and look for shelter
03:53 - during the night the goal is to get to
03:55 - the castle but as you get closer and
03:57 - closer the towns become fewer and fewer
03:59 - the first team to get to the town gets
04:01 - access to some better weapons which you
04:03 - need to defend from other players so it
04:05 - has a certain battleground charm to it
04:07 - looks like the perfect game to exemplify
04:10 - how stylish you can go with all of your
04:11 - games if you do it right you can make
04:13 - something silly and stylish but still
04:15 - makes sense it's also pretty cheap and i
04:17 - think that helped finding success with
04:19 - having already over 1200 positive
04:21 - reviews
04:22 - looks like a great game to pick up with
04:24 - your friends and just have a good time
04:26 - then for one that just came out of early
04:27 - access after over a year war pips
04:30 - it's an rts slash tower defense game
04:33 - you've got lots of upgrades and lots of
04:35 - units to compose your army there's an
04:37 - entire world to conquer it's got quite a
04:39 - lot of variety in the maps i remember
04:40 - seeing this one back when it launched
04:42 - into early access and it seems like they
04:44 - use that time to really flash out the
04:45 - game it's got a really interesting
04:47 - visual style all of the units are in 2d
04:49 - pixel art but the world vehicles all of
04:52 - it is in 3d so that makes it for a very
04:54 - unique look
04:55 - i'm a fan of rts games although usually
04:57 - i don't have time to get really deep
04:59 - this one seems like it has quite a lot
05:01 - of depth but also due to the interesting
05:03 - mix of turner defense and rts it also
05:05 - looks like it's easier to get started
05:07 - either way it's a really interesting new
05:09 - unique take on the rts genre so if you
05:11 - like that definitely give it a shot and
05:13 - up next car detailing simulator i have
05:15 - to say one of the things that i love is
05:17 - just washing things watching something
05:19 - really dirty and cleaning it up and
05:20 - fixing it all up is one of the things
05:22 - that is immediately appealing to me this
05:24 - one is obviously all about cars you can
05:26 - clean both the exterior and the interior
05:28 - use a variety of tools to get the job
05:30 - done so you can use some basic soap you
05:32 - can brush the leather and clean
05:34 - everything to perfection and on top of
05:36 - that you can also paint some cars
05:38 - as usual you start on a pretty crappy
05:40 - garage just detailing some cheap cars
05:42 - then you upgrade more and more onto
05:44 - better and better cars and onto a better
05:46 - and better garage
05:48 - the reviews all mention just how
05:49 - relaxing the game is so if that's what
05:51 - you're looking for then this looks like
05:52 - a great entry in the so-called job
05:54 - simulator genre then up next here we
05:57 - have a highly anticipated sequel roman
05:59 - legacy 2.
06:00 - this one is actually quite interesting
06:02 - the original game was made with xna but
06:04 - they switched to unity for this one the
06:06 - original rogue legacy is also another
06:08 - great game that i've had on my list for
06:10 - ages but i haven't played it yet
06:12 - basically it's a roguelike action
06:14 - platformer the main twist is when your
06:16 - character dies you take control of one
06:18 - of their descendants it's a really
06:20 - awesome really unique mechanic to let
06:21 - you keep upgrades over time
06:23 - although some descendants also have some
06:25 - negative traits which really helps make
06:27 - each run very unique
06:28 - this sequel is just bigger and better
06:30 - you've got tons of biomes lots of
06:32 - variety it only just came out and
06:34 - already has thousands of very positive
06:36 - reviews so if you don't like the
06:37 - original it looks like you're going to
06:38 - love this one then over here is another
06:41 - sandbox game that looks really
06:42 - interesting it's called action sandbox
06:44 - it's in 2d which actually makes it
06:46 - pretty unique most sandbox games
06:48 - nowadays are in 3d
06:50 - features lots of jiggly physics and has
06:52 - an emphasis on combat and powerful
06:53 - weapons
06:54 - also has quite a lot of nature elements
06:56 - so you can build some flay throws or
06:58 - some ice shields it's also got
07:00 - integrated workshop support so if you
07:02 - like to explore what other players can
07:04 - make then you can give this a look and
07:06 - up next here is one that i'm not quite
07:08 - sure how to pronounce wing county the
07:10 - little shop something like that
07:12 - it's all about building and running your
07:14 - own fantasy shop you buy low and sell
07:16 - high so you start off simple just buying
07:18 - some cheap items and selling them for a
07:20 - quick profit
07:21 - then you move on to actually creating
07:23 - things you can farm and craft some items
07:25 - use the proceeds and keep expanding your
07:27 - shop
07:27 - decorate your shop to make it really
07:29 - appealing to all of your visitors and as
07:31 - your shop grows you can hire workers who
07:33 - really help you out
07:34 - it's out now after three years of early
07:36 - access it had tons and tons of updates
07:39 - during that time the developers are very
07:41 - responsive and the reviews are all very
07:43 - positive i haven't played any shop
07:45 - simulator or tycoon game in quite a
07:46 - while so i'd like to find the time to
07:48 - give this one a shot
07:49 - and finally at number one for my
07:50 - personal pick of the month it's another
07:52 - one that just came out after a very
07:54 - successful time in early access it's
07:56 - dwarf romantic
07:57 - it's a peaceful building strategy game
08:00 - you have a bunch of tiles given to you
08:02 - kind of like cars from a deck and you
08:04 - place them down in the world different
08:06 - tiles have different things so some have
08:08 - rivers others have towns windmills
08:10 - forests
08:11 - the gameplay is simple but there is a
08:13 - nice strange layer some tiles are best
08:15 - placed near others giving you bonus
08:17 - points for making larger villages or
08:19 - completing some train tracks as the
08:21 - world gets bigger you explore different
08:23 - unique biomes and pre-placed objects
08:25 - show up with some unique tasks for you
08:26 - to complete
08:27 - or you can really just play to relax the
08:29 - game has a very calming atmosphere there
08:32 - are no disasters no enemy attacks just a
08:34 - nice whirlwind some gorgeous visuals and
08:36 - thanks to how it's all procedurally
08:38 - generated you can always get a brand new
08:40 - experience basically this looks like a
08:42 - great game to play for 10 minutes every
08:44 - once in a while when you feel stressed
08:46 - just do a quick playthrough and you'll
08:47 - be much more relaxed
08:49 - it's also another great example of how
08:51 - game design is always evolving and even
08:52 - with thousands of games coming out every
08:54 - month there are still games that feel
08:56 - refreshingly unique it is now fully
08:58 - released out of early access and the
09:00 - over ten thousand overwhelmingly
