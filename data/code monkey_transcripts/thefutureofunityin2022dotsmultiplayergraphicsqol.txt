00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - gdc was a while ago and there were a
00:04 - bunch of interesting talks but they were
00:06 - not live streamed on their twitch
00:07 - channel however right now you can find
00:09 - them all in a playlist on the unity
00:11 - channel i'm watching all the talks right
00:13 - now there's quite a bunch of interesting
00:15 - things going more in-depth into various
00:17 - projects they announced recently and of
00:19 - course the talk most people really
00:20 - wanted to see was the roadmap tonk so
00:22 - here's my quick summary of it basically
00:24 - it's exactly what people have been
00:26 - asking for lots of quality of life
00:28 - improvements various performance and
00:29 - stability update and just general
00:31 - incremental updates so nothing too
00:34 - earth-shattering but all the things they
00:36 - have in progress are getting better and
00:37 - better honestly watching this talk my
00:39 - biggest takeaway is really just how much
00:41 - stuff unity does there's so many topics
00:43 - so many use cases and so many teams
00:45 - working on tons of different things for
00:47 - me i just make single player 3d games on
00:49 - my pc using urp and the latest lts
00:52 - version but unity also supports 2d
00:55 - multiplayer hdrp it has editor tools vfx
00:58 - graph shadowgraph terrains mobile
01:00 - consoles raytracing dots profiler vr ar
01:03 - and tons tons more things keeping up
01:05 - with all of those tools is actually one
01:07 - of the reasons why i decided to make my
01:08 - ultimate unity overview course in there
01:11 - i go through all of the dozens of unity
01:12 - tools and features to see what they do
01:14 - and how they work there's already over
01:16 - 15 lectures available in that course but
01:18 - unity has even more that i haven't
01:20 - covered yet so i plan to continue free
01:22 - updates for that course for a long time
01:25 - so here let's look at some quick
01:26 - highlights from the road map tonk but
01:28 - before that this video was sponsored by
01:30 - gamedevguild this is an online
01:32 - conference all about unity game
01:34 - development organized by jason wyman the
01:36 - talks are presented by various unity
01:38 - experts on all kinds of topics so you
01:40 - can learn about performance getting a
01:42 - job in the games industry or going
01:44 - full-time indie learn about vr
01:46 - multiplayer blend shapes game audio and
01:48 - tons more you'll also have a chance to
01:50 - ask questions live and even win some
01:51 - awesome stuff the conference is running
01:53 - from may 24 to 26 and there will be
01:55 - recordings after click the link in the
01:57 - description and register today okay so
01:59 - the road map talks started off once
02:01 - again emphasizing the difference between
02:03 - the lts and the tech versions actually
02:06 - made a video on this topic and it's one
02:07 - of my most watched videos it can
02:09 - definitely be quite confusing if you
02:11 - just started using unity but after a 30
02:13 - second summary it becomes super clear
02:15 - how the versions work and just as i was
02:17 - recording this version 21 lts has just
02:20 - been published ideally you should be
02:22 - using the lts version in your projects
02:24 - it's the most stable one but if you want
02:26 - to see the cutting edge tools that unity
02:28 - is developing then those are on the 22
02:30 - version so then they talked about what
02:32 - were their core pillars for the 21
02:34 - version making sure unity has good
02:37 - workflows for everyone regardless of
02:39 - your area of expertise so making sure
02:41 - both hardcore programmers and designers
02:43 - can work together flawlessly this was
02:45 - primarily by making visual scripting a
02:47 - built-in tool rather than an extra
02:49 - add-on this one was a great addition to
02:51 - the engine
02:52 - and speaking of that just another quick
02:54 - plug if you want to learn about visual
02:55 - scripting you can check out my complete
02:57 - course where i make three unique games
02:58 - all entirely using visual scripting
03:01 - there's not a single line of code
03:02 - anywhere in any of those games
03:04 - so that course really showcases just how
03:06 - capable visual scripting is the course
03:08 - was made with bolt which was the
03:10 - original tool that they bought and then
03:12 - renamed into visual scripting which is
03:13 - now built directly into the engine but
03:16 - 99 of it works exactly the same as in
03:18 - unity 2021 there's only been a handful
03:21 - of changes which i also covered in
03:22 - another video so that one was the big
03:24 - focus in 21 better workflows visual
03:27 - scripting and then also improved acid
03:29 - importing and a bunch more quality of
03:31 - life improvements the other core pillar
03:33 - was faster to quality this includes
03:35 - adding feature sets which automatically
03:37 - install a bunch of packages related to
03:39 - what you want to do much faster to get
03:41 - up and running there were also search
03:42 - improvements to quick search in order to
03:44 - make finding things much faster the
03:46 - profiler was also improved as well as
03:48 - testing with the device simulator then
03:50 - urp and agrp continue getting lots of
03:52 - improvements those improvements are
03:54 - present in the 22 and in the 21 version
03:57 - and more and more platform support so by
03:59 - now unity truly runs on anything you can
04:02 - make a build for ps5 a xbox series x and
04:05 - s and even for apple silicon so those
04:07 - were some of the additions and
04:08 - improvements to the 21 version which has
04:10 - just hit lts for me i always stick with
04:13 - lts so i've been using version 2020 lts
04:15 - in all my projects for the past year so
04:17 - it's going to be nice to finally do an
04:19 - upgrade and look at all these new
04:20 - features then was the part about the 22
04:23 - tech stream quite a lot of things
04:24 - they're working on right now tons of
04:26 - teams working in parallel their main
04:28 - pillars for this release are these ones
04:31 - improved workflows and productivity
04:33 - again just making everything smoother
04:35 - and easier to use with better and better
04:37 - iteration time then also editor
04:39 - customization with the ui toolkit so
04:41 - helping you make better tools to make
04:43 - better games faster visuals that scale
04:46 - on anything so making a gorgeous mail on
04:48 - mobile or pc or webgl also improvements
04:51 - to game performance the plan with
04:53 - version 22 is to get dots to 1.0 by the
04:56 - time the 22lts version is out so if so
04:58 - that should be awesome another great one
05:01 - is the multiplayer foundation their
05:02 - netcode for gameobjects is progressing
05:04 - really nicely so it's hopefully out of
05:06 - preview soon
05:07 - and more and more platform optimizations
05:10 - again making sure that unity games run
05:11 - on any device you want so looking at
05:13 - these pillars i would say they
05:15 - definitely have the right goals in mind
05:16 - if they achieve all of this in this year
05:18 - then version 22 will definitely be epic
05:21 - then they dive a bit deeper into all of
05:22 - these topics i'm just going to briefly
05:25 - go through all of them if you want to
05:26 - watch the full video it's still in the
05:27 - description and in that same playlist
05:29 - you also find dedicated videos to some
05:31 - of these things there's a bunch of talks
05:33 - talking about dots one talking about the
05:35 - enemy cgi another one about the giga
05:38 - project and so on so definitely check
05:40 - out that playlist after watching this
05:41 - video okay so first up there are
05:43 - improvements to the package manager
05:44 - especially for more large teams better
05:47 - compiler performance and net standard
05:49 - 2.1 apis also more search improvements
05:52 - and the ability to use api endpoints to
05:54 - make custom search windows
05:56 - faster acid importing play mode
05:58 - compilation build serialization and more
06:00 - so lots of tiny things to make iteration
06:03 - much faster much better
06:04 - one big area of continued improvement is
06:07 - the ui toolkit making it suitable for
06:09 - building editor tools as well as in-game
06:11 - ui
06:12 - now for this one i'm very interested in
06:14 - having just one tool set for both those
06:16 - use cases will definitely be hugely
06:18 - helpful
06:19 - but at the same time this one is also
06:20 - quite confusing to me i still cannot
06:23 - quite understand what is the state of ui
06:25 - tonkit i thought it was still in preview
06:27 - but upon searching some more apparently
06:29 - the latest package says that it's in
06:31 - preview however the reason why that one
06:33 - is stuck in preview is because it is now
06:35 - built into the engine itself
06:37 - i think that's the case i'm not 100 sure
06:40 - but if that is the case then in the 21
06:42 - lts ui toolkit is now production ready
06:44 - for editor tools just not for in-game ui
06:48 - so if i'm correct about that and someone
06:50 - from unity is watching this then i would
06:52 - ask to add some sort of note on the ui
06:54 - toolkit package it's the first thing
06:56 - that comes up on google and looking at
06:57 - the change log there's no mention of
06:59 - anything so it makes it seem like it's
07:01 - in a ben package but it's obviously not
07:03 - it's now apparently built directly into
07:05 - the engine so that package is no longer
07:07 - used so i'm still a bit confused with ui
07:09 - tonkit but anyway sorry about that
07:11 - engine i'm looking forward to using just
07:13 - a single tool for building both ui and
07:15 - editor windows i think that's going to
07:16 - be great continuing with the 21 road map
07:19 - there were more improvements to both urp
07:21 - and agrp
07:23 - they also mentioned giga this is the
07:25 - project they're currently working on
07:27 - visually it looks really awesome and
07:28 - it's all made in urp
07:30 - basically they have a team using
07:31 - european production and then giving
07:33 - their feedback back to the dev team so
07:35 - everyone benefits also one nice addition
07:37 - is custom post pressing effects
07:40 - right now that's not really something
07:41 - you can do easily
07:43 - i did do a video on one way that you can
07:45 - do that so i did some research and i
07:47 - found a way on how you can make custom
07:49 - post rusting effects
07:50 - but it's quite a bit of a hack so having
07:52 - some proper support is definitely great
07:55 - then on hrp again some more continued
07:57 - improvements and again they also have a
07:59 - team actively using the tool and giving
08:01 - their feedback to the dev team you've
08:03 - probably seen the enemy's short film
08:05 - it's truly impressive gorgeous graphics
08:08 - and the most impressive of all is
08:09 - exactly this everything that you see
08:11 - there is running on a vanilla version of
08:13 - the engine previous demos like adam and
08:16 - the heretic those were gorgeous but in
08:18 - order to work those had tons of custom
08:20 - code to make it look so good however
08:22 - this time of the improvements they are
08:24 - making to get to this level of quality
08:26 - all of those improvements are available
08:27 - to anyone using agrp so no custom code
08:30 - everyone benefits then some more
08:32 - improvements to shadowgraph and vfx
08:34 - graph i haven't actually used them in
08:36 - quite a while i haven't made any special
08:38 - effects in quite some time but
08:39 - improvements are always great something
08:41 - really awesome in version 22 is the
08:43 - spline tool if you need a spline right
08:46 - now i actually made a video where i
08:47 - built a nice class and went through how
08:49 - all of the math works and there's also a
08:51 - bunch of awesome spline tools free on
08:53 - the acid store but still it's really
08:55 - nice to have a built-in tool then there
08:57 - are a bunch more terrain improvements
08:58 - also a bunch of lighting improvements
09:00 - and of course unity is both a 3d and a
09:03 - 2d engine so lots of continued
09:04 - improvements coming to 2d there's a
09:06 - better faster sprite atlas improvements
09:09 - to the physics also lots of animation
09:11 - improvements specifically for authoring
09:13 - 2d animations directly inside unity and
09:16 - specifically for using 2d bones they
09:18 - highlighted their own dragon crashes
09:20 - demo i looked at this one when it came
09:22 - out it's really awesome it's a great
09:24 - showcase of all the awesome 2d tools
09:26 - that unity has
09:28 - and then something small but really
09:30 - awesome are the new templates right now
09:32 - if you go into unity hub and you
09:34 - sunlight version 22 you can actually see
09:36 - the templates previously you only had an
09:38 - empty one with the built-in renderer and
09:40 - then you had the urp and hdrp samples so
09:43 - if you wanted a empty project with the
09:45 - 2d tools you had to create an empty
09:47 - project using the built-in renderer then
09:49 - manually install urp then manually make
09:51 - the 2d render and so on whereas now you
09:54 - just have all of these various templates
09:55 - so you have the 2d empty template and
09:58 - when do it simply automatically installs
09:59 - all of the packages you need to make 2d
10:02 - then also a really nice 3d empty agrp
10:04 - and urp templates again just some nice
10:07 - simple quality of life improvements to
10:09 - make your life easier and starting
10:10 - projects much faster there were also
10:12 - more profiling improvements especially
10:14 - for analyzing memory really useful
10:16 - considering how garbage is always a
10:18 - problem i haven't used the profiler much
10:20 - since i launched my last steam game
10:22 - which was almost 3 years now but it's
10:23 - always nice to see it continuing to
10:25 - improve
10:26 - when working on demos and quick
10:27 - prototypes the pro tap isn't really
10:29 - necessary but it's definitely an
10:31 - absolute must when working on a proper
10:32 - big project then of course one of the
10:34 - biggest things for version 22 is dots
10:37 - the massive update to 0.5 has just
10:39 - released and the plan is to hit 1.0
10:41 - during the 22 lts
10:44 - personally i'm really excited about that
10:45 - i can't wait to see all of the new games
10:47 - that this tech will enable in the coming
10:49 - years something that a lot of people are
10:51 - always asking me for tutorials about is
10:53 - multiplayer a while ago unity bought the
10:56 - ml api and they've been working on it
10:58 - under the new name netcode for game
11:00 - objects
11:01 - for me i'm just waiting for it to come
11:02 - out of preview and when it does i'm
11:04 - definitely going to do tons of tutorials
11:06 - on it there's already a sample game for
11:08 - this one
11:09 - so if you're interested definitely go
11:11 - ahead download it and look at how it
11:12 - works and speaking of netcode
11:14 - dotsnetcode is also in development those
11:17 - two are different tools then also a
11:19 - bunch of platform improvements some
11:21 - things from mobile i don't really do
11:23 - much in mobile development so i'm not
11:24 - sure how significant any of these are
11:27 - for desktop and console there's support
11:29 - for apple silicon which is nice there's
11:31 - the linux editor and some webgl
11:33 - improvements
11:34 - also ray tracing for ps5 and apparently
11:36 - xbox coming soon and of course unity
11:38 - also does both ar and vr there's quite a
11:41 - bunch of improvements on there verified
11:43 - support for openxr basic interactions
11:45 - toolkit and more alright and that's the
11:48 - roadmap as you can see tons of
11:49 - improvements in tons of different areas
11:52 - nothing too earth shattering just lots
11:54 - of improvements across the board if you
11:56 - want more detail definitely go watch the
11:57 - whole tank but more than that go check
11:59 - out all the gdc videos in the playlist
12:02 - i'm watching them all right now and
12:03 - there's quite a lot of interesting stuff
12:04 - there you can learn more about kikaya
12:06 - about the enemies demo you can learn
12:09 - about unity gaming services the trends
12:11 - for gaming in the future and so on so
12:13 - lots of interesting info and with this
12:14 - my takeaway for the int roadmap tonk is
12:17 - that unity is currently great in the
12:19 - present and the future looks great too
12:21 - so if they managed to do all these
12:23 - things this year then version 22 lts
12:25 - will definitely be epic and as some of
12:27 - these things start to come out of
12:28 - preview like for example netcode for
12:30 - game objects dui toolkit ui builder and
12:32 - so on as those have their full release
12:34 - you can definitely expect that i'll be
12:35 - doing quite a lot of tutorials on all of
12:37 - those and of course like i previously
12:39 - mentioned i will continue making tons of
12:41 - updates explaining tons of these tools
12:43 - and features for my ultimate unity
12:44 - overview course alright so that's the
12:46 - unity roadmap for 22 lots of exciting
12:49 - things coming up in the future and don't
12:51 - forget to check out game dev guild to
12:52 - learn from unity experts click the link
