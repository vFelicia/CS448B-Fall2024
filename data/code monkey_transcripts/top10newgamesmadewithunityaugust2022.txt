00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made with unity launching August
00:05 - 22. the reason why I make these videos
00:07 - is show you everything that the engine
00:08 - can do the only limit is really just
00:10 - your own skills and Imagination and the
00:12 - variety and the awesomeness of the game
00:14 - shown here really puts out to the test
00:15 - all of these games are uniquely
00:17 - impressive so the list is in no
00:18 - particular order except for the number
00:20 - one game that is my personal pick them
00:22 - up also right now the two excellent
00:24 - humble bundles are still active the
00:26 - tools bundle was supposed to end but it
00:28 - got extended if you haven't seen these
00:30 - bundles I highly recommend you unlock
00:31 - them it's a massive 98 discount so it's
00:34 - worth it if just a single asset looks
00:36 - interesting alright so starting off at
00:38 - number 10 with the biggest hit this
00:40 - month count of the lamp
00:41 - it's a very unique game the subject
00:44 - matter sounds pretty ominous and serious
00:45 - running account but it's combined with
00:48 - some very cute lamp characters
00:49 - and it seems that people really like
00:51 - this combo already has over 20 000 very
00:54 - positive reviews and already sold over 1
00:56 - million copies in just one week the game
00:58 - itself isn't action broke-like you run a
01:01 - count which means you go out on
01:02 - adventures you fight off enemies and
01:04 - grow your flock by Saving new followers
01:05 - you can then give them a name change
01:07 - their form and what makes them unique
01:09 - then you preach some daily sermons to
01:11 - your file content to them you'll need
01:12 - them feed them and build your small
01:14 - community and of course there are always
01:16 - those non-believers so it's up to you to
01:18 - decide how to handle them the game
01:20 - definitely uses a very unique style so
01:22 - that's probably the main reason why it's
01:24 - been so successful and behind that style
01:26 - is also an excellent very well made game
01:28 - and up next we have a nice Indie sequel
01:30 - Hardware S2 it's a really gorgeous game
01:33 - I love the visuals on this one great
01:35 - assets with some very thick Shadows
01:37 - giving it a really nice comic book look
01:38 - the game is a turn-based strategy game
01:41 - so something along the lines of XCOM but
01:43 - Western and with some fantasy on that
01:46 - elements as you might know I spent the
01:48 - last five months working on my
01:49 - turn-based strategy course so this genre
01:51 - is definitely one that I very much enjoy
01:53 - you have some very unique abilities and
01:55 - you use your revolver to bounce bullets
01:57 - and hit your tires from cover that makes
01:59 - for some very interesting tactic
02:01 - scenarios and of course in a western you
02:03 - are only as good as your Posse so
02:05 - recruit and equip them with punchier
02:07 - guns explosives and trinkets for all
02:09 - kinds of effects take out all the
02:11 - enemies and keep your squad alive in
02:13 - these sequence are pretty rare and this
02:14 - one seems to improve upon the original
02:16 - in every way so if you're looking for
02:17 - some nice turn-based tactics then check
02:19 - this out then if you want to experience
02:21 - some Mayhem with Friends check out plate
02:24 - up this is a co-op roguelite management
02:26 - game definitely a unique mix
02:29 - the obvious comparison would be with
02:31 - overcooked which is also an excellent
02:32 - game but this one stands out by adding
02:34 - that management layer so you need to
02:37 - both manage the kitchen as well as a
02:38 - restaurant so you place down some tables
02:40 - and chairs upgrade your equipment so you
02:42 - can cook faster when player Cooks well
02:44 - the other one is out serving food then
02:46 - you also select from a bunch of cards
02:48 - what exactly you want your restaurant to
02:50 - be like so we only go for some Gourmet
02:52 - dining or maybe something more like fast
02:54 - food the choice is yours it features
02:57 - some local as well as some online
02:58 - multiplayer it already has
03:00 - overwhelmingly positive reviews so if
03:02 - you have a group of friends and want to
03:04 - have a good time then this looks
03:05 - excellent for some really nice
03:06 - management here we have farthest
03:08 - Frontier features very gorgeous and very
03:11 - realistic visuals looks really nice it
03:13 - looks set in kind of the 1800s so you
03:16 - have horses and carriages lots of small
03:18 - buildings and some Churches being a
03:20 - management surround game means that you
03:22 - need to go out you need to gather
03:24 - resources hunt fish and farm to survive
03:26 - then take those raw materials and craft
03:28 - something use that to trade consume and
03:30 - equip your villagers to fight for their
03:32 - survival the description says that it
03:34 - features one of the most detailed
03:36 - farming systems ever I'm definitely
03:37 - curious to see what that means there's
03:39 - also a very Advanced Village simulation
03:41 - so the villagers have their lives and
03:43 - they manually transport Goods so things
03:46 - don't just magically disappear from one
03:48 - place and appear another and being said
03:50 - in the 1800s means you have to deal with
03:52 - all of the old-timey diseases like
03:54 - scurvy dysentery and color despite
03:56 - looking like a relatively Niche game it
03:58 - already has over 5000 very positive
04:00 - reviews so if you're into city builders
04:02 - then this looks like an excellent new
04:04 - one and up next for something really
04:06 - stylish and really awesome here is
04:07 - rollerdrome it's an extremely unique
04:10 - game I've heard it described as Tony
04:12 - Hawk meets Max Bane so that definitely
04:14 - has me intrigued basically you have a
04:16 - bunch of roller skates then you can go
04:18 - into slow motion and shoot some bad guys
04:20 - you have several weapons at your
04:22 - disposal and the way that you reload is
04:24 - by doing some tricks so you're
04:26 - constantly on the Run jumping and doing
04:28 - all kinds of tricks to shoot the bad
04:29 - guys and get a high score the game has a
04:32 - generous aim assist system so your focus
04:34 - is really on looking cool rather than on
04:36 - Pixel Perfect aim visually it also
04:38 - definitely stands out with a very unique
04:40 - style some very thick outlines on
04:42 - everything coupled with some really nice
04:43 - sound shading so all in all it's a very
04:46 - unique stylish game I love both Tony
04:48 - Hawk and Max Payne so this combo
04:50 - definitely interests me for some VR here
04:52 - we have a really interesting one Airport
04:54 - ground handling Simulator the really
04:57 - interesting part about this one is that
04:58 - it's not exactly a game it's literally a
05:01 - training simulator with that you can
05:03 - expect some excellent realism and insane
05:05 - levels of accuracy and detail
05:07 - so if you've ever wanted to inspect a
05:09 - plane up close open some cargo doors
05:11 - fill up with gas and so on if that's a
05:13 - desire you have then this looks
05:15 - excellent it's an early access which
05:17 - means it launched with just one of the
05:19 - planned 5 scenarios personally I think
05:21 - that VR is an excellent platform for
05:23 - this kind of training simulator and I'm
05:25 - really looking forward to some things
05:27 - like this becoming more and more common
05:29 - maybe one day there won't be a realistic
05:31 - car admission Factory game or something
05:33 - managing a warehouse or maybe a Space
05:35 - Center so the future looks really
05:37 - interesting for this kind of VR training
05:39 - simulators and I'm definitely curious to
05:41 - see more than if you're a fan of rts's
05:44 - here's a very realistic one called
05:46 - regiments it is set during the height of
05:48 - the Cold War the focus really is on
05:51 - accuracy realism and combined arms
05:53 - rather than sending hundreds of soldiers
05:55 - you send artillery to soften your target
05:58 - then break through the enemy line engage
06:00 - in some tactical Retreats stage defenses
06:03 - and some counter attacks you fight on
06:05 - massive maps and need to win multiple
06:07 - small engagements in order to win the
06:09 - war features lots of real world units
06:11 - some tanks helicopters airplanes all of
06:13 - them with tons of stats and some really
06:15 - authentic models the game features a
06:17 - smooth learning curve and a nice
06:19 - campaign that tells a complex story of
06:21 - warfare around the inner German border
06:23 - from multiple perspectives
06:25 - certainly is a very unique game in the
06:27 - RTS genres since there are no infantry
06:29 - just lots of mechanized combat then for
06:32 - a game with a very unique mechanic
06:33 - called backpack hero it's an inventory
06:36 - management roguelike again definitely a
06:38 - very unique combo this is basically if
06:40 - you took my Tetris inventory system that
06:42 - I covered in a previous video and
06:44 - basically made a fun game based on that
06:46 - idea it looks really awesome you have
06:49 - tons of items as you explore this
06:51 - dungeon then every item has a certain
06:53 - shape and it's up to you to put it in
06:55 - your backpack in the best place possible
06:56 - the placement of the items has a huge
06:59 - impact you can play certain items next
07:01 - to others for some huge bonuses there
07:04 - are hundreds of rare items each with
07:05 - their own unique effect and the
07:07 - inventory isn't really a neat
07:09 - rectangular shape you expand it as you
07:11 - explore the Dungeon and get some really
07:12 - interesting shapes so if you want to see
07:14 - how to take an interestingly connect and
07:16 - make an entire game around that then
07:18 - this game is an excellent use case that
07:19 - you can study then for something that
07:22 - just came out of Early Access across the
07:24 - Obelisk it's a deck building roguelite
07:26 - RPG where you choose Your Heroes unlock
07:29 - items and cards craft your deck and face
07:31 - powerful enemies in deep tactical combat
07:33 - There are 16 unique characters who
07:36 - unlocked your party and over 500 cards
07:38 - and items for you to choose craft and
07:40 - upgrade being a roguelite means that it
07:43 - has procedural world making everyone
07:44 - unique and highly refleable and one very
07:47 - unique thing is how it features four
07:49 - player online co-op so when playing in
07:51 - multiplayer each player controls one
07:53 - unique hero which means you all have to
07:55 - work together to decide what is best for
07:57 - the group as usual with every game that
07:59 - launched out of Early Access you can
08:00 - definitely expect to have tons of
08:02 - content already has over 3000 very
08:04 - positive reviews so if you don't like
08:06 - this genre definitely give it a look and
08:08 - finally at number one for my personal
08:09 - pick of the month here we have the
08:11 - second game in the two point franchise
08:13 - two point campus just in case you don't
08:15 - know this is a team that was formed by
08:17 - former bone frog veterans that was a
08:19 - studio that made theme park Hospital For
08:21 - Me theme hospital was a huge part of my
08:23 - childhood I absolutely loved that game
08:25 - so when the scene was formed and they
08:27 - came out with their previous game two
08:29 - point hospital I played right away
08:30 - really awesome this time they are taking
08:33 - their signature style and applying it to
08:35 - a University campus so it's filmed with
08:37 - the usual and silly humor that you would
08:39 - expect for example you have night school
08:41 - where you guessed it you train some
08:43 - Medieval Nights you built your
08:45 - University hired some staff and
08:46 - encourage students to enroll in your
08:48 - courses the whole thing looks very silly
08:50 - and a very fun time all the building
08:52 - tools are really easy to use placing
08:54 - buildings roads props all of that is
08:56 - super simple and it all looks really
08:58 - nice and jolly the game already has a
09:00 - thousand very positive reviews so it
09:02 - seems like it's yet another great hit
09:03 - I'm really looking forward to playing
09:05 - this one and seeing what other genres
09:07 - they won't tackle in the future I can't
09:08 - wait until 10 years from now when
09:10 - there's a whole bunch of awesome fun
09:11 - two-point games alright so that's 10
09:14 - awesome new games made with unity and
09:16 - launch in August 22. I hope this list
