00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - in this video we're going to create the
00:03 - Health System and UI from Apex legends
00:05 - let's begin
00:09 - so apex Legends has a bunch of really
00:12 - interesting systems and in here we're
00:13 - going to create the health system it's
00:16 - relatively simple to implement but
00:17 - nicely complex during gameplay so first
00:20 - we have a normal health bar it has 100
00:22 - HP and when we get hit the bar it goes
00:24 - down just like that then we have our
00:27 - shield segments which has exhort the
00:30 - damage before the health so we have the
00:33 - shield bars separated into four segments
00:35 - at most how many segments you have is
00:37 - dependent on the body armor you have
00:39 - equipped then we have the various items
00:41 - you can use so again let's cause some
00:43 - damage and we can use the shield cell to
00:46 - repair our shield and a syringe and a
00:48 - medicate to repair our health
00:50 - so let's create all these ailments and
00:53 - have our very nice final bar all right
00:56 - so let's do it
00:57 - first let's create the health bar and
00:59 - the UI just like in the game so here in
01:02 - my canvas let's start off by creating
01:29 - all right so here is the basic setup we
01:32 - have the background containing our
01:34 - background we have a player named Tex
01:37 - containing the name of the player then
01:39 - we have a armor and a helmet display
01:41 - each of them has a background sprite and
01:44 - then on top of it a item sprite the
01:47 - armor will affect how many shield
01:48 - segments we have and the helmet doesn't
01:50 - actually impact the health system but so
01:52 - it is part of the you want so now here
01:55 - in the textures folder I have all the
01:57 - textures needed to display the various
01:59 - health bars here is for the health bar
02:01 - and then for the shield bar the first
02:03 - one is different from the other one so
02:04 - I've got the first one and I've got the
02:06 - others so let's set up the health bar
02:08 - first as normal we make a container and
02:21 - inside we have our bar just like that
02:23 - and behind the bar we are going to have
02:25 - a background which will use the exact
02:29 - same sprite except on a dark grey color
02:32 - all right so now on our bar in here on
02:35 - the image type instead of using simple
02:36 - we're going to use filled we're going to
02:39 - choose horizontal going from the left to
02:41 - the right and so on and now in here we
02:43 - now have a very nice fill amount that
02:45 - goes from zero to one that we can modify
02:47 - to change how much health our character
02:49 - currently has so this is the only field
02:51 - we need to modify when updating our bar
02:53 - now let's deal with the shield bars
02:56 - which will have very much the same
02:58 - composition as our health bar
03:09 - and then on the shield we also have
03:12 - another sprite on top of it just like
03:15 - that it has a nice outline so this is
03:17 - the very first shim bar which as you can
03:19 - see it is slanted only on the right side
03:21 - on the left side it is perfectly
03:22 - vertical
03:23 - so let's duplicate this to make the
03:25 - second shield except instead of using
03:27 - that sprite we're going to use the
03:29 - shield slanted sprite and yep there it
03:32 - is and now let's fill up on the other
03:33 - segments
03:51 - all right so that's all of our human
03:54 - bars correctly located so now that we
03:56 - have everything set up in the editor
03:58 - let's make our code so here on these
04:01 - scripts let's make a new c-sharp script
04:03 - this will be the character window so
04:06 - first on awake let's grab references to
04:09 - all of our objects okay so here are all
04:24 - of our references as you can see the
04:26 - health bar is on health bar and then the
04:28 - bar and then we get the image component
04:29 - so let's see that's the health bar
04:32 - inside we have the bar and then we have
04:34 - our image which then we access this
04:36 - component so again we can modify the
04:38 - filament okay so in here on that says to
04:41 - see how we were going to modify the bars
04:43 - so we simply test the health image and
04:46 - set the fill amount to let's say 0.38 so
04:50 - the health bar should be at 3% so let's
04:53 - see in here drag the character window
04:55 - script okay let's see and yep there's
04:57 - the health bar currently being displayed
04:59 - at 30% all right now back into the code
05:02 - now in here this script will only handle
05:05 - the visuals so we're going to have all
05:07 - the mechanics for our health system in a
05:09 - separate class so let's make that class
05:11 - a new c-sharp script this won't be our
05:14 - character so this won't be the class
05:17 - that holds all the logic for the
05:18 - character and is completely separate
05:20 - from all of our visuals so the first
05:22 - thing we need to know is what equipment
05:23 - this character is using which will
05:25 - modify how many shown bars are visible
05:27 - so let's use an in-home to define our
05:31 - various equivalent types
05:37 - so we have anonymity armor then we have
05:41 - a film to store that body armor so now
05:43 - let's make a constructor and in that
05:46 - constructor we set the body armor by
05:48 - default to body armor nut also a public
05:52 - function to return our body armor and a
05:56 - function to set it all right so this is
06:02 - the very basic character class that
06:04 - contains all of our equipment so now
06:06 - let's test our code for testing let's
06:09 - create a game hammer which will be our
06:11 - basic starting script responsible for
06:13 - creating and modifying the character as
06:15 - well as giving the character window
06:16 - decal reference so let's make a very
06:19 - simple call it our game Handler and
06:22 - we're just going to drag it on to our
06:24 - game handler game object ok so in here
06:27 - on our void awake let's create a
06:31 - character and now we're going to tell
06:34 - the character window to display using
06:36 - this character so it's grab a reference
06:39 - for the character window we're going to
06:46 - dry this reference in the editor and
06:48 - then on our character window we're going
06:50 - to have a function to set our character
06:55 - so let's make that function right now go
06:57 - into the character window and here make
07:00 - a public void seven character alright so
07:08 - we have everything set up in order to
07:09 - test so in here let's just do a debug
07:11 - log on our character just to make sure
07:14 - it was correctly set so again we have
07:17 - the game handle just running our awake
07:18 - on awake it creates a new character and
07:21 - it tells the character window to display
07:22 - using that character and on the
07:24 - character window we simply set our
07:26 - internal field and we do a debug log to
07:29 - make sure it was set so let's run and
07:31 - yep there's in the console a character
07:33 - object ok great
07:35 - so now with our character we can go into
07:37 - our character window and we're going to
07:39 - enable or disable the shield segments
07:41 - based on the armor of that character so
07:44 - let's make a function to do that
07:48 - as the character to return its body
07:51 - armor so body armor we're going to go
07:53 - into the character and get the equipped
07:56 - body armor okay then let's do a switch
07:59 - on that bag armor case we have no body
08:05 - armor then we're just going to hide all
08:07 - of our shield segments in order to hide
08:12 - it we're simply setting the game object
08:14 - to active to false case we have body
08:19 - armor tier 1 then we only show you the
08:21 - first one and so on and so forth all
08:28 - right so this should be correctly
08:29 - displaying all the shield segments based
08:31 - on what the character is currently
08:33 - equipping let's just change the code to
08:35 - make it easier to follow so in here we
08:37 - set them all as inactive in the
08:39 - beginning then we do a switch and we
08:42 - simply set some of those back to true so
08:44 - we're doing the exact same thing just
08:45 - easier to fall and here after we set the
08:48 - character we update the shield segments
08:50 - alright so that should be correct
08:52 - let's try run the code and seeing if all
08:55 - of them are disabled and yet there you
08:57 - go only the health bar is visible all of
08:59 - the others are invisible now let's go
09:02 - into the ham Handler and after we create
09:04 - the character let's do character dot set
09:08 - the equipped body armor and let's give
09:10 - it a tea or two now let's see how many
09:14 - segments are visible and if there it is
09:16 - now two segments are visible okay so all
09:19 - logic is working now the shield segments
09:21 - also change their color based on the
09:23 - tear of their armor so let's deal with
09:25 - that
09:33 - so here we have the code we are defining
09:35 - a body armor color than if it's Tier one
09:37 - we set it to a simple color than another
09:39 - color another and in the end we update
09:41 - all the images with the body armor cone
09:43 - so now we need to define all these
09:45 - colors so we want to do them as a
09:47 - constant so let's go into the character
09:49 - and up here let's do a public const
09:55 - color this will be the tier 1 color then
10:02 - we do a call now in here we have an
10:04 - error since color cannot be defined as a
10:06 - constant so one trick we can use to make
10:09 - a color act pretty much like a constant
10:11 - is to make this instead of comes to make
10:12 - it a static read-only just like that we
10:16 - can instantiate a color and it works
10:17 - perfectly fine so we will define a tier
10:20 - 1 2 & 3 and on the character window
10:24 - let's use that so we use the character
10:27 - dot tier 1 cone all right so we are now
10:33 - using those contents so let's go and set
10:35 - these all right so here are our colors
10:44 - now let's go and see if our bars are
10:47 - being correctly tinted and also one more
10:50 - thing in here this is actually not
10:51 - correct based on how the game works on
10:53 - tier one you actually have two bars on
10:56 - tier two you have 390 or 3 you have 4
11:00 - all right so that should be working just
11:02 - like in the game let's see any of there
11:04 - it is with a tier 2 body armour we have
11:06 - three segments and they are tinted in
11:08 - blue now let's try a tier 3 change this
11:12 - to a tier 3 body arm and yep there it is
11:14 - now we have four segments tinted in
11:16 - purple all right great
11:17 - now let's also update the armor icon in
11:20 - here so let's go here make a private
11:23 - void update body armor icon now we're
11:28 - going to do very much the exact same
11:29 - thing with it in here we get the body
11:32 - armor from the character we do a switch
11:34 - on it
11:57 - okay so after updating the shield
11:59 - segments we update the body armor icon
12:01 - so we go down here into this function
12:03 - very much the same method that we did
12:06 - previously we get the party armor first
12:08 - we set the icon to invisible and if we
12:11 - have no body armor equipped then we keep
12:14 - that body armor icon invisible if we do
12:17 - have something then we set it to visible
12:19 - and we set the background color to the
12:21 - character tier cone okay let's see okay
12:25 - so here we are with a tier 3 body arm as
12:27 - you can see there's the icon saying tier
12:29 - 3 now let's change it
12:30 - now let's instead we have no body armor
12:33 - and yep the icon is invisible and the
12:37 - shin guards are also all invisible ok
12:39 - great so now we can visually see what
12:41 - item we have equipped and how many
12:43 - segments that item gives us now it's
12:46 - actually set things up so we can see the
12:48 - damage so here on the character class
12:50 - let's create two fields so we have a
12:54 - health for our health amount initial for
12:57 - the shield amount
12:58 - now it's add some damage functions and
13:04 - now in here we need to figure out how
13:05 - much will be shield damage and how much
13:07 - is health damage so we do if our damage
13:10 - amount if it is under the shield amount
13:13 - then here the shield absorbs all damage
13:20 - if not then the shield cannot absorb all
13:25 - damage so let's calculate how much
13:28 - health won't be damaged so we decrease
13:30 - the health by the damage amount - what
13:33 - was absorbed by the shield and then we
13:36 - set the shield to zero so if we have 10
13:39 - shield and we are taking 20 damage we
13:42 - get hit on the health by 20 minus 10
13:45 - which equals 10 so we get 10 health
13:47 - damage and shield goes to zero all right
13:49 - so this should be working after this
13:52 - let's do a text pop up just so we see
13:54 - our stats I'm going to use the code
14:00 - monkey utilities to go down here and
14:02 - create a text pop up you can download
14:04 - the utilities for free from me and
14:06 - tickle my comm
14:07 - so using from the CM debug class you a
14:09 - text pop up on the mouse position and
14:12 - for the text let's show the shield
14:15 - amount and then the health amount and
14:18 - now we also need to define the initial
14:20 - values for the health initial so when
14:22 - you create a character and let's give it
14:23 - a photon so health equals and now we
14:25 - need a health max so we have a constant
14:36 - for the maximum health and one for the
14:39 - shield amount per segment so we set the
14:41 - help to our health maximum and when we
14:43 - set the equipment money armor let's set
14:45 - the shield as well
14:59 - all right so when we set the equipment
15:01 - armor we set the shield if we have none
15:03 - then we set it to zero if not we set it
15:05 - by the shield amount per segment and
15:07 - here two segments three and four all
15:09 - right great
15:09 - so we now have our shield and health
15:12 - Valley's being correctly in Senshi ated
15:14 - and a damage function to reduce them so
15:16 - let's go into the game Handler to test
15:18 - it and here let's create a debug button
15:23 - to test that damage so again the CMD
15:26 - well class contains a very nice function
15:28 - to create a button on the UI so this
15:36 - function lets me create a button on a
15:39 - certain position on the UI in this case
15:40 - just under the center of our screen
15:42 - it won't say damaged 20 and when we
15:44 - click it will execute this action which
15:46 - won't trigger 20 damage to our character
15:48 - so let's see okay so there it is there's
15:51 - the debug button and our character
15:53 - correctly set up with a tier two armor
15:56 - so essentially he has a hundred health
15:58 - and 75 armor so if I click on it yep
16:03 - there you go 55 100 so the armor went
16:05 - down by 20 click again and you should
16:07 - say 35 100 yep coming again should say
16:09 - 15 100 and now it should say 0 + 95
16:13 - since the whole shield will be depleted
16:15 - and we won't start taking damage in our
16:17 - health yep there you go 0 95 and so on
16:19 - so far ok great so the logic for the
16:22 - shield and the health is correctly
16:24 - working so now back in the code and here
16:26 - on the character after we take damage we
16:28 - need to tell the window to update the
16:30 - visual representation of that damage so
16:33 - for that let's create an event so let's
16:35 - go all the way up here make a public
16:37 - event we're going to call this on health
16:42 - shield change so this is our event which
16:47 - we're going to trigger after we caused
16:49 - some damage so if we have subscribers
16:52 - that event trigger that event with this
16:55 - an event arts empty okay so this event
16:58 - is fired when we change our health or
17:00 - shield so now we can capture this event
17:03 - on our character window in here when we
17:05 - set the character
17:07 - let's do character dot on health she'll
17:10 - changed we subscribe to this event and
17:13 - here let's call function called update
17:15 - health shield and let's make that now
17:21 - here first let's just update the health
17:23 - since it's very simple we just go into
17:26 - our health image and we set the fill
17:28 - amount now in here we need a normalized
17:31 - value in order to get a normalized value
17:34 - we divide the current value by the
17:36 - maximum value so let's go into the
17:38 - character and make a function to return
17:40 - our health value so here we are
17:45 - returning the health okay so now we can
17:47 - go in here and we get the character dot
17:50 - get help
17:52 - divided by the character dot health max
17:56 - all right so just like this we get our
17:58 - normalized Val
18:00 - however in here since we are dividing
18:02 - two ends we need to make sure one of
18:04 - them gets cast to float so we get the
18:06 - correct result otherwise we would just
18:08 - get 0 so in here and let's just cast
18:09 - this first one down to a fold okay so
18:13 - let's run the code and see if the health
18:15 - bar is correctly updating okay so here
18:17 - we're there's the character with full
18:18 - health all right now I click on the
18:20 - image there you go first it's damaging
18:22 - the shields and now it will damage the
18:24 - health yep there you go it cut off by a
18:26 - bit another bit another and so on
18:28 - alright great so we are correctly
18:30 - updating our help now let's see only the
18:32 - shield now the shield is more tricky
18:34 - than the health since its split into
18:36 - segments instead of a complete bar so in
18:38 - order to get the amount we also need a
18:40 - function on our character to return the
18:42 - shield so in here let's define an int
18:48 - for the shield then we get the character
18:50 - get shield okay now let's cycle through
18:53 - all of our segments
18:59 - so we cycle through all four of our
19:02 - shield segments and now in here we need
19:04 - to know if the shield amount is on this
19:06 - particular segment so let's calculate
19:08 - these shield segments min and Max so
19:18 - here we have the minimum for this
19:20 - particular shield segment so the shield
19:22 - segment on index 0 will start off at 0
19:25 - multiplied by something so it won't be 0
19:26 - and the maximum will be 0 plus 1 which
19:29 - is 1 multiplied by the shield amount per
19:31 - segment which is 25 so it'll be 25 so
19:33 - the very first shield segment will
19:35 - display the shield amount from 0 to 25
19:37 - so now we can calculate how much of the
19:40 - bar is empty or filled so first we do if
19:43 - she'll if it is under our shield segment
19:47 - min if it is under or equal to that
19:51 - amount then this bar is completely empty
19:53 - in here let's define a shield array so
19:56 - we can easily use our indexes okay so we
20:06 - have an array containing 0 1 2 3 all
20:08 - right so we can now go down here and use
20:10 - the same index so the shield image array
20:13 - on index I this one is completely empty
20:16 - so we set the fill amount to 0 okay so
20:20 - then we do an else so if it's not under
20:27 - the minimum let's see if it's above the
20:29 - maximum if it is about the maximum then
20:36 - the bar is completely filled so we set
20:38 - this to 1 oh the bar Tskhinvali film and
20:41 - then finally if it's not at the minimum
20:43 - or the maximum then the shield is
20:45 - somewhere in between
20:53 - so here we need to calculate the fill
20:55 - amount all right so we can't lead the
21:10 - film mount by taking our shield removing
21:13 - the minimum from that shield and then
21:14 - defining by the amount per segment so if
21:17 - the shield is three and we are checking
21:19 - the second segment then essentially this
21:21 - will be 30 minus 25 so it will be 5 and
21:24 - then 5 divided by the shield amount per
21:26 - segment and then we get the correct film
21:28 - amount all right so this should be
21:30 - working perfectly fine now we are also
21:32 - cycling through the shield bars that are
21:34 - hidden but that is really not an issue
21:36 - so let's test so for starters we got
21:39 - three bars since we got a tier two armor
21:41 - and we have everything filmed now I
21:44 - click on damage and if there yo there's
21:46 - the shield as you can see it was
21:48 - correctly damaged the bar has a size of
21:50 - 25 and we damage 20 so it does make
21:52 - sense that it's about there so continue
21:54 - damaging and I went through that bar and
21:56 - into that one and again and into that
21:58 - one and then down and now that one and
22:01 - now the health bar started going down so
22:03 - as you can see all the shield bars
22:04 - decreased correctly and when they became
22:07 - empty the health bars are taking damage
22:09 - now it just has to be different
22:11 - equipment so here with no equipment
22:17 - let's damage any of their yo we just
22:19 - went through the health bar and using
22:26 - Tier three we can click and yep there
22:27 - you go everything was filmed now
22:28 - everything is starting to take damage
22:30 - the shield is going down going down and
22:32 - now the health bar is going down okay
22:33 - great so everything seems to be working
22:35 - perfectly fun so now that we have damage
22:38 - working let's see a weight healing now
22:40 - the items that we can use are separated
22:42 - by what type they heal so if we have
22:45 - ninety health and we have only twenty we
22:47 - don't end up with ten shield so we have
22:49 - items for increasing our shield amount
22:51 - and items for increasing our account
22:52 - amount so let's go into the character
22:55 - and here let's make those functions
23:03 - so here all we do is increase the help
23:06 - by our amount then we also do a clamp to
23:10 - make sure our health is within valid
23:12 - values and the same thing on the shield
23:17 - we increase the shield by our amount
23:24 - then we also do a climb on the shield
23:27 - with a minimum of zero and for our
23:30 - maximum and here we actually still need
23:32 - a function to return our shield maximum
23:47 - all right so we have a function that
23:49 - returns a shield maximum based on the
23:51 - body armor and here we come up with
23:53 - using that as the maximum all right so
23:59 - we have two very simple functions to
24:01 - heal our health and heal our shield and
24:03 - again after we modify these variables we
24:06 - need to trigger the event so we can
24:09 - notify our window all right that you do
24:12 - it now let's make some buttons for
24:14 - testing
24:32 - all right so we have a testing buttoned
24:35 - heel 25 health heel 25 shield then 100
24:39 - and 100 shield no it said another one
24:41 - that won't heal on both of them okay
24:48 - let's test okay here we are with a bunch
24:51 - of buttons now we first start off as
24:54 - kamala phone
24:55 - okay so let's damage the radio damaging
24:57 - some she'll know it's heal just 25
25:00 - shield if they're good she went up now
25:02 - mighty on the health and yep nothing
25:04 - happened since the health is already
25:05 - full so continue damaging and damage
25:08 - down to the home now I hear home yep
25:10 - works for only fine heal the shield goes
25:12 - up you don't shield a hundred and
25:14 - everything goes out now go down again
25:16 - heal the health the older she'll get it
25:18 - all down and yep every single button is
25:20 - working we can increase the shield and
25:22 - home separately and once we go past the
25:25 - help she'll does not go up and get both
25:27 - them and damage alright great so we can
25:30 - out damage and heal our character and
25:32 - whenever we do our window automatically
25:35 - updates alright so now let's add some
25:38 - effects first let's make a red bar that
25:41 - is visible for a while after getting hit
25:42 - that way we can see how much damage we
25:45 - took when we were last hit so let's go
25:48 - into the editor and here on the health
25:50 - bar let's duplicate the normal health
25:53 - bar tint it in red and put it under the
25:57 - normal bar okay essentially this bar is
26:02 - shown to display damage that the player
26:03 - took and then fades away so it like
26:05 - starts in here and then fate so let's go
26:07 - into our code so we get the reference
26:15 - for our damage health image then we're
26:18 - going to me the timer to know when to
26:19 - fade it and let's define a constant for
26:25 - the fade time remarks
26:29 - all right so we have all the information
26:32 - we need to be able to do our nice effect
26:34 - so let's go down into our update on the
26:40 - update let's first test if the image is
26:42 - visible by testing the color alpha so we
26:46 - go into the dimensional image we get the
26:48 - color we test the Alpha so if the Alpha
26:52 - is bigger than zero then the damage
26:54 - health image is currently being
26:55 - displayed so if it is visible we count
26:58 - down the damage Alzheimer and then if
27:03 - the damage health timer is under zero
27:06 - then we start lowering the image alpha
27:26 - all right so we tested the damage health
27:28 - image is visible if so we countdown the
27:30 - timer if the timer is over then we
27:32 - create a new color essentially we lower
27:35 - the Conger antha and we're going to make
27:37 - it come on the vanish within half a
27:39 - second and we set the new color onto our
27:41 - damaged melt come okay
27:43 - so that's pretty much it for our fade
27:45 - now what we need to do is show the
27:47 - damage health image when we get hit now
27:50 - we also need to know the previous health
27:52 - amount so we know the size of the bar to
27:54 - show so let's go up here so we store the
28:00 - previous half amount
28:01 - so let's set it when we set the
28:03 - character and down here when the health
28:07 - or the shield has changed so when the
28:10 - health changes we set first of all the
28:12 - fate timeline set it to the maximum okay
28:17 - and now let's test if the damaged count
28:21 - images out color alpha if it is not
28:25 - visible so if it is at zero if it isn't
28:29 - visible we need to set the correct size
28:31 - so we size it based on the previous
28:33 - health amount so it's not only we do the
28:36 - same thing that we are doing for the
28:38 - health image but for the damage health
28:40 - image using the previous health amount
28:44 - divided by the health max so the health
28:47 - image won't contain besides the bar as
28:49 - it is right now and the damage health of
28:51 - an image won't take on the previous size
28:53 - and then we also set the collar to the
28:55 - phone
29:17 - all right so here is our code again we
29:20 - are resetting the timer whenever the
29:21 - helm changes if the health bar is
29:23 - invisible then we set these signs and we
29:26 - make it fully visible if the health bar
29:28 - is already visible then the only thing
29:30 - we're going to do is actually just set
29:31 - the Alpha so instead we put this out
29:33 - here all right so let's see that effect
29:38 - okay so here we are no armor for health
29:41 - so let's try causing some damage yep
29:43 - there's the red health bar showing how
29:45 - much we previously had now click it
29:47 - again yeah there you go we previously
29:48 - had that one so we can easily see that
29:50 - we took this amount of damage damage
29:52 - again yep there you go it stays in red
29:54 - and then vanishes after once
29:56 - now let's heal it's not fully healed
29:58 - damage again yep there's the bar again
30:00 - showing and again showing it if I get
30:02 - hit twice it just resets the time so you
30:04 - gotta hit twice
30:05 - there you go everything shows and
30:06 - everything disappears all right so
30:08 - that's a great effect now let's add a
30:10 - final effect which is flashing when we
30:12 - are on low HP so again we're going to
30:15 - duplicate our bar this one won't be
30:17 - always completely filmed and let's make
30:20 - it a darker red so essentially when the
30:28 - health bar is too low we're going to
30:31 - flash this by increasing and decreasing
30:32 - the Alpha all right so let's go into the
30:35 - code
30:41 - so you grab the reference to the health
30:43 - flashing image now let's go into the
30:45 - update and here on let's deal with the
30:48 - flashing help image we're always going
30:51 - to have it flashing and then we either
30:53 - just enable or disable the game object
30:56 - in order to do a flashing we need to
30:57 - store a variable that won't say either
30:59 - we're increasing or decreasing the Alpha
31:01 - so let's go up here so we get the Alpha
31:08 - change and by default let's set it in
31:10 - here let's set it to positive so now we
31:16 - can go down into the update we get the
31:20 - low health color which is from the low
31:25 - health image dot color so you get the on
31:30 - low health color then we increase the
31:32 - color alpha by the low health alpha
31:36 - change okay and then we check if the low
31:39 - health color kalfa if it is bigger than
31:42 - one F then it has been fully flushed so
31:45 - we need to reverse the alpha change so
31:49 - we simply multiply it by minus one out
31:53 - so we reverse it okay and we do the same
31:58 - thing if it is under zero we also
32:01 - reverse and we set it to zero okay so
32:03 - after changing the low health color we
32:06 - go into the in low health flashing image
32:08 - and set the color to the new oil health
32:10 - color
32:11 - so this is our flashing code and again
32:14 - we're only going to run this code if the
32:16 - low health flashing image game object is
32:19 - active so if the game object is active
32:23 - we run this code and by default that
32:26 - will be inactive so let's go up here and
32:28 - we take the game object and set the
32:30 - active into phones so by default that
32:33 - flashing image is not visible so we need
32:37 - is to update this bar got set active
32:39 - when we change our health so let's go
32:42 - down here when the health has been
32:44 - changed
32:46 - let's set the active to be true if the
32:50 - character that get health if it is under
32:54 - 30 so if we have under 30 HP then this
32:58 - will be visible if not then it won't be
33:00 - invisible
33:01 - okay so let's test there's the health
33:05 - bar just as normal now cause some damage
33:07 - there's the normal one showing the
33:09 - damage okay and the flashing one isn't
33:12 - visible alright great damage again and
33:14 - still not visible and 30 HP is about
33:16 - here so it should now show up and yep
33:19 - there's the flashing right there since
33:20 - we are under 3 HP it says flashing now
33:23 - if I heal yeah there you go the flashing
33:25 - is vanished since we are no longer on
33:26 - drastic low HP and then which again
33:29 - there you go without showing how much we
33:30 - damage we took and that one is flashing
33:32 - since we have very low help and heal and
33:36 - there you go heal again now it's done
33:37 - yep great all right so we have added
33:39 - some very nice effects now let's replace
33:42 - these testing buttons with some more
33:43 - proper buttons
34:24 - and yet we have replaced the testing
34:26 - buttons with some very nice buttons and
34:28 - we can now still cause damage there you
34:30 - go there's a bar flashing now I increase
34:32 - the health now increase the shield
34:33 - shield make shield damage at all almost
34:36 - dead everything flashing kill everything
34:39 - and yep every single button works so we
34:41 - can now damage and heal both our shields
34:43 - and our health so there you have it we
34:46 - created the health system and UI from
34:48 - apex legends we have a health bar and a
34:51 - certain number of shield segments based
34:53 - on the body armor we have equipped we
34:55 - can trigger damage which first goes
34:56 - through the shields before damaging the
34:58 - help we also have various items to
35:00 - regain health and shields as always you
35:03 - can download the project files any
35:04 - tony's from unity kentucky.com if you
35:06 - have any questions post them in the
35:07 - comments and I'll do my best to answer
35:08 - them subscribe for more videos and I'll
35:10 - see you next time
