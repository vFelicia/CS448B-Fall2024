00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and for the past few weeks I've been
00:04 - working on a printense project
00:05 - essentially it's a complete full length
00:08 - very high quality course that I will
00:09 - upload as a free video here on YouTube
00:11 - the file name for the massive course
00:13 - script is called multiplayer free course
00:15 - not text that was the original intention
00:17 - to make a quick simple two-hour free
00:19 - course on just multiplayer but then I
00:21 - thought people might be confused because
00:23 - even a simple game would require people
00:25 - to learn the code base in order to learn
00:26 - how to convert it into multiplayer and
00:29 - it's also been quite a long time since I
00:31 - made a really detailed video targeted at
00:32 - beginners so I end up with a plan of
00:35 - making a phone course length video on
00:37 - making a game and then a second course
00:39 - line video on making it multiplier it
00:41 - looks like the single player portion
00:43 - won't be about 6 hours long and the
00:44 - multiplayer maybe three or four hours so
00:46 - in total about 10 hours of free learning
00:48 - with the same level of quality as my
00:50 - paid courses the gaming question is
00:52 - something like overcooked so there's a
00:54 - character there's some kitchen counters
00:56 - and there's a bunch of interactions like
00:58 - picking up ingredients preparing them by
01:00 - cooking and cutting them placing them in
01:02 - plates and delivering them now I need
01:04 - your help and the way that you can help
01:05 - me is pretty simple
01:07 - when the video eventually comes out just
01:09 - go ahead and click on video as soon as
01:11 - you see it hit the like button and watch
01:12 - the video that's really it if you do
01:15 - just that you won't be helping me quite
01:16 - a lot basically I'm putting in a ton of
01:18 - work into making this a really awesome
01:20 - tutorial that is useful for both
01:22 - beginners and more advanced users I do
01:24 - think the funnel video will be really
01:26 - awesome like I said it's on the same
01:28 - level of quality as my paid courses it
01:30 - has a heavy focus on writing good clean
01:32 - code some good project structure and
01:34 - good organization I will not be teaching
01:37 - bad practices that you see in so many
01:38 - beginners tutorials instead I will teach
01:40 - you how to write good high quality
01:42 - production ready code just like I use in
01:44 - my own Steam games since I'm making it a
01:46 - free video instead of a paid course I
01:48 - would at least like for it to reach tons
01:50 - of people YouTube's main metrics are
01:52 - click-through rate watch time and
01:54 - interactions so if a bunch of you click
01:56 - on the video watch it and like it then
01:58 - YouTube will hopefully promote the video
02:00 - and it will help tons of people that's
02:02 - really it now I'm still working on the
02:04 - course so not exactly sure on timing I'm
02:06 - hoping by somewhere in the middle of
02:07 - January I will make another video asking
02:10 - for your help just before the video goes
02:12 - live remember that on the website on
02:14 - your account if you want you can set it
02:15 - to receive emails you can can get
02:17 - notified for every video once a week or
02:19 - once a month it's up to you so whether
02:22 - you're a beginner or a more advanced
02:23 - user if you've ever wanted to see how I
02:25 - build my own games with some high
02:27 - quality code then definitely stay tuned
02:29 - I even hired an artist to make some 3D
02:31 - models that I can then distribute so you
02:33 - won't be able to download the free ads
02:34 - and follow along thank you to all of you
02:36 - who have ever picked up one of my
02:38 - courses or bought one of my film links
02:41 - it's really only because of you that I
02:42 - can afford to dedicate all this time and
02:44 - effort making a really awesome high
02:46 - quality course that I won't release
02:47 - completely for free I really love the
02:49 - concept of only charging for a few
02:50 - things I do and giving most of it away
02:52 - for free I truly think that education
02:54 - should be free for anyone who wants to
02:56 - learn and thankfully as long as some of
02:58 - you do those things I can afford to do
03:00 - this speaking of affiliate links there's
03:01 - a bunch of interesting deals happening
03:03 - right now so if you need any assets
03:05 - tools or sounds you can get them with a
03:07 - nice discount and I get a nice
03:08 - commission there's four excellent humble
03:10 - bundles and a sale on the NTS store the
03:13 - bundles are extremely deep discounts as
03:15 - usual they're 98 off so if just one
03:17 - thing looks interesting then the entire
03:19 - bundle is more than worth it there's a
03:21 - bundle on a bunch of low poly visuals by
03:23 - Blink really great publisher with some
03:25 - great looking low poly assets there's
03:27 - the tools bundle that is actually repeat
03:28 - so if you missed it back then definitely
03:30 - don't miss it now same thing for the art
03:32 - bundle also repeat also excellent and
03:35 - there's one with a bunch of audio sound
03:37 - and assets these humble bundles actually
03:39 - have a pretty high commission rate by
03:41 - default I get 15 so for example if you
03:44 - get this tools bundle through my link in
03:45 - the description if you do then you pay
03:47 - the normal bundle price 30 bucks and I
03:49 - get to keep 450. then the unts store is

03:58 - Monday it's a new year so it won't be a
04:01 - really fun summary of 22 covering all
04:03 - the interesting tutorials and videos
04:04 - that I made as well as a bunch from some
04:06 - other entry creators alright so once

04:10 - support and watching the videos I
04:12 - genuinely hope that watching this
04:13 - channel has helped you on your own
04:14 - gamedev Journey
