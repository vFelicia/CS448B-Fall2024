00:02 - hi there this is a quick tip for how to
00:04 - keep your code clean with a serialize
00:06 - field attribute so let's say you have a
00:08 - script and you want to set some variable
00:10 - here in the editor now one way you could
00:12 - do it is simply go into the script and
00:14 - make a public variable if you do this
00:19 - you can indeed go into the editor and
00:22 - now here it is a film that you can
00:23 - easily drag something on to it however
00:25 - doing it this way is very dirty since
00:28 - you end up making public variables that
00:29 - really should be private so that means
00:31 - that you have the unintended consequence
00:33 - that you have another class in here as
00:46 - you can see we can easily modify this
00:48 - tree variable so if this one is meant to
00:50 - be only used inside this script then we
00:53 - should not use public so we should put
00:55 - this as private and doing so this will
00:58 - now show an error since we can unlock it
01:00 - access it however in doing so since this
01:03 - is no longer public and then what shows
01:05 - up in the editor so sometimes you might
01:07 - have a variable that you want to keep
01:09 - private to keep your code clean but you
01:10 - also want it to be editable inside the
01:13 - editor so you can either drag reference
01:15 - or modify someone like a units movement
01:17 - speed so we can keep our code clean by
01:19 - leaving it as private so we cannot
01:21 - access it outside of our class and we
01:23 - simply add the serialized film attribute
01:26 - this way our variable is still private
01:28 - and we still cannot access it from
01:30 - outside of this class however if we go
01:32 - into the editor as you can see there it
01:35 - is it shows up in there and we can drag
01:36 - it as if it were public and that's it
01:39 - hope you found this tip useful alright
01:41 - see you next time
