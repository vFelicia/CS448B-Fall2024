00:17 - check out the phone playlist to see all
00:18 - of the highlights every month you might
00:20 - find something that would be perfect for
00:21 - whatever project you're currently
00:23 - working on let me know in the comments
00:24 - if you pick up any of these and what you
00:26 - intend to do with them also right now
00:28 - unity is having a massive black friday
00:30 - sale for these free assets naturally
00:32 - that doesn't matter but if there's any
00:33 - paid assets you've been waiting for then
00:35 - this is your best chance of the best
00:37 - assets are currently discounted
00:39 - everything from tools models animations
00:41 - effects and just about anything check it
00:43 - out with the link in the description
00:44 - alright so starting off with actually
00:46 - one that is simultaneously free and not
00:49 - so this is a shader pack with tons of
00:51 - shaders over 180 effects works on all of
00:53 - the render pipelines now the thing is
00:56 - this one is all based on the amplify
00:58 - shader editor and if you do own that
01:00 - then it's completely free the amplify
01:02 - shader editor it's an editor kind of
01:04 - like shadowgraph and has existed for
01:06 - many many years this asset has been part
01:08 - of quite a lot of previous bundles in
01:10 - sales so chances are you already have it
01:12 - and if you do you can go into the store
01:14 - page and you can get all these really
01:16 - awesome effects all completely for free
01:18 - now for the rest of this list everything
01:19 - is commonly free so for example here is
01:21 - a really nice spin blower it does
01:23 - exactly what it says applies a blur to
01:25 - moving objects it looks really excellent
01:27 - when applied to swords or tires the
01:30 - comparison video is really excellent at
01:31 - showcasing the massive difference it
01:33 - makes so it's one of those things that
01:35 - it really helps add that extra bit of
01:36 - polish to make your games really stand
01:38 - out next up here's some really good
01:40 - looking liquid simulation
01:42 - it really looks very impressive works on
01:44 - both urp and agrp
01:46 - now this one is the free version but
01:48 - there's also a paid version the free
01:50 - limitations are based on number of
01:52 - collisions and limited number of
01:53 - emitters but if you have just a simple
01:56 - use case then the free version might be
01:57 - enough next up here's a pack with some
01:59 - great stylized textures
02:01 - features 20 unique materials they
02:03 - include all kinds of maps color maps
02:06 - roughness ao
02:07 - and all textures are in 2k so pretty
02:09 - high resolution so great simple pack if
02:12 - you need a bunch of high quality free
02:14 - textures then if you need a vehicle for
02:16 - your game here's a police car it's a
02:18 - great model slightly low poly but not
02:21 - too much personally i think it looks
02:22 - great also includes an interior and
02:25 - separated parts so the body doors wheels
02:28 - and steering wheel all separated so you
02:30 - can easily animate them
02:31 - so this could be great for a racing game
02:33 - or maybe something open world kind of
02:35 - like gta and if you like this style then
02:37 - this developer has tons more vehicles
02:40 - then if you're working on a game with a
02:41 - cute art style and you need some ui
02:43 - here's a great one
02:45 - features 40 icons a bunch of buttons and
02:47 - a nice wallpaper
02:49 - if you like the style then there's also
02:50 - a paid pack with many more items and
02:52 - objects then here's a really fun one a
02:55 - low poly training dummy
02:57 - looks really nice and it even comes with
02:59 - two animations die and fall down so this
03:01 - one could be great for adding to a
03:03 - training scene in some sort of action
03:05 - game then here's an interesting tool to
03:06 - generate ropes you place down a plane
03:09 - then select some objects and it
03:10 - generates a rope around those objects
03:13 - it's dynamically generated so you can
03:15 - even move it and play around the visual
03:17 - definitely a niche tool but if you need
03:18 - some ropes and here it is then if you're
03:20 - working in 2d here's a pack with a bunch
03:22 - of weapons both melee and shooting
03:25 - weapons
03:26 - they look pretty good nice cartoony
03:28 - textures so you could use this for
03:29 - example with the 2d aiming system that i
03:31 - covered previously and lastly here's a
03:33 - nice free pack with a bunch of modular
03:35 - armor pieces personally i've got some
03:38 - paint packs from this developer i quite
03:39 - like the style it's low poly but not too
03:41 - low poly this 3 pack comes with a bunch
03:44 - of characters and 6 modular armor sets
03:46 - alright so those are my top 10 free new
03:48 - assets on the unt asset store for
