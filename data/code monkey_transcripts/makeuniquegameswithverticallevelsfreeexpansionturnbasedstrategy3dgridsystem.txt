00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code
00:01 - monkeying and after you started a second
00:03 - free expansion to my turn-based strategy
00:05 - course it's all about taking the game
00:07 - built in the course and any support for
00:08 - multiple floors with this addition you
00:10 - can make much more complex levels with
00:12 - some interesting vertical layouts this
00:14 - was the second most request stopped by
00:16 - students the first free expansion is
00:18 - already out and that one was on adding
00:19 - hex grids this second multiforms
00:21 - expansion works on both grid types so
00:23 - you can add it to either square or hexes
00:25 - in these nine lectures we will refactor
00:27 - a bunch of code to support not just one
00:29 - but multiple grid systems at different
00:31 - televisions thanks to the quality of the
00:33 - code this change is actually pretty
00:34 - simple the more complex part is on
00:36 - handling the pathfinding but even that
00:38 - is just a basic refactor we're going to
00:40 - modify to enable the units to move
00:41 - between the grids but we also don't want
00:43 - to make the move in any position so
00:45 - we're going to hand on creating some
00:46 - pathfinding links and we're even going
00:48 - to make a nice and simple editor script
00:50 - to make those links easier to create
00:51 - then we're going to handle the visuals
00:53 - make it so that we can add whatever
00:55 - visual we want when the unit is going up
00:57 - or down now I'm not an animator so I
00:59 - went with a Super Bass music jump and
01:00 - drop but you could very easily replace
01:02 - it with a proper leather clamp animation
01:04 - without changing any of the code and
01:06 - finally we're going to set up some
01:07 - visible logic so we can zoom in the
01:09 - camera and have the object size
01:10 - themselves so we can still play with all
01:12 - the folders underneath with all that
01:14 - we're going to have another really
01:15 - awesome feature added to this already
01:17 - awesome turn-based strategy game and
01:19 - once again thanks to how all the code in
01:21 - the course is written in a nice clean
01:22 - way this is going to be a super easy
01:24 - addition just like the hex suspension we
01:26 - don't need to touch the AI the visual
01:28 - studio detection system or anything like
01:30 - that because all the code is really
01:31 - clean with as few dependencies as
01:33 - possible this Edition doesn't really
01:34 - require changing many files so this
01:36 - expansion is yet another great example
01:38 - of the power of writing good clean code
01:39 - now if you're already on the course then
01:41 - this is a free expansion so you already
01:43 - have access to it it's at the end of all
01:45 - the lectures right after the hex
01:46 - expansion and if you don't yet on the
01:48 - course you can get it to the link in the
01:49 - description it's a really awesome course
01:51 - that will help you take your skills from
01:52 - beginner to Advanced reviews have been
01:54 - extremely positive so I'm really happy
01:56 - with how it came out throughout the home
01:57 - course I'm constantly talking about
01:59 - writing good clean code and focusing on
02:01 - keeping a good code architecture because
02:03 - of that the final state of the course is
02:05 - very adaptable and easily Expendable so
02:07 - don't let me know what other mechanics
02:08 - and systems you'd like to see in future
02:09 - expansions alright so I hope you enjoy
02:11 - this second free expansion thanks for
02:13 - watching and I'll see you next time
