00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - in this channel i normally cover
00:03 - tutorials on how you can build your own
00:05 - games in unity but in this video instead
00:07 - of doing it ourselves let's take some
00:09 - time to look at some great games that
00:10 - showcase the power and versatility of
00:12 - the unity engine
00:13 - this is actually the third video so if
00:15 - your favorites aren't on here then maybe
00:17 - they're in the previous one
00:18 - let's begin with a really awesome city
00:20 - builder named city skylines
00:22 - you manage a city design roadways define
00:24 - where housing and workplace exist
00:26 - keep track of all the power lines and
00:27 - everything in between everything is
00:29 - simulated with tons of options at your
00:31 - disposal
00:32 - you can make some excellently designed
00:34 - organic cities and keep
00:35 - everything running smoothly it's been
00:37 - out for a couple of years and it's got a
00:39 - very good modding scene with tons of
00:40 - unique mods
00:41 - as well as lots of dlc over the years
00:44 - adding things like concerts snowfall
00:46 - mass transit disasters and so on
00:48 - this is made by a relatively small indie
00:50 - studio or at least it was initially
00:52 - and it is widely considered to be one of
00:54 - the best modern city builders unlike
00:56 - another game with a very famous name
00:58 - so where a triple a studio failed this
01:00 - indie studio came in
01:01 - using unity and made an excellent game
01:04 - next up we have hearthstone
01:06 - as you may know this one is made by
01:08 - blizzard which is a massive triple a
01:10 - studio famous for world of warcraft
01:12 - diablo overwatch and many more
01:14 - they normally build their own engines
01:15 - but for this project they went with
01:17 - unity
01:18 - it's a card game where you get down to
01:19 - your hand with various creatures and
01:21 - abilities and you must defeat your
01:22 - opponent
01:23 - who can be either an ai or another
01:25 - player it features tons of cards it's
01:28 - had
01:28 - lots of expansion since it first came
01:30 - out and it's one of the most well
01:31 - polished games ever made
01:32 - if you want to study how to add polish
01:34 - onto your own games then you should
01:35 - definitely study hearthstone
01:37 - when it came out this was a huge hit and
01:39 - it made the car genre a lot more popular
01:42 - without heart zone we might never have
01:43 - gotten games like slay the spire
01:45 - also i believe it was one of the first
01:47 - hugely popular games to be both playable
01:49 - on a desktop as well as mobile playing
01:51 - the exact same game
01:53 - before that games were either mobile or
01:55 - desktop never really both
01:57 - but thanks to how good unity is at
01:59 - taking the exact same code base and
02:00 - making mobile and desktop builds
02:02 - this has become more and more common
02:04 - before we see the rest of this list this
02:06 - video is sponsored by skillshare

03:03 - thanks to skillshare for supporting the
03:05 - video and supporting the channel and
03:06 - over here is enter the gungeon
03:08 - it's a great game with a great name
03:10 - mixes multiple genres
03:12 - it's simultaneously a bullet hell
03:13 - combined with a roguelike dungeon
03:15 - crawler it's a very unique combo
03:17 - so you can loot shoot dodge roll and
03:19 - table flip your way towards the ultimate
03:21 - treasure
03:22 - select your hero or team up in co-op and
03:24 - battle your way
03:25 - surviving a challenging and involving
03:27 - series of lures filmed with dangerous
03:29 - enemies and fearsome bosses
03:30 - it's been very successful thanks to its
03:32 - interesting theme and excellent gunplay
03:34 - if you want to learn how to mix weird
03:36 - genres together then you should study
03:38 - this game
03:38 - there's also a funny spin-off named exit
03:41 - the dungeon which takes a similar
03:42 - concept and flips it on its head
03:44 - it was a great marketing gimmick even if
03:46 - the game was underwhelming compared to
03:48 - the excellent original
03:49 - by the way if you find the video helpful
03:51 - please hit the like button
03:52 - it's a tiny thing but really does help
03:54 - thanks then if you want to have fun with
03:56 - friends or maybe just destroy some
03:57 - friendships here is overcooked
03:59 - it's an excellent co-op game about
04:01 - managing a kitchen and cooking the right
04:03 - dishes for your customers
04:04 - you have various stations and
04:06 - ingredients and every action needs to be
04:07 - done on a specific station
04:09 - and takes a certain amount of time so
04:11 - the only way to succeed is to work with
04:13 - your partners and ensure each person
04:14 - does their own tasks so the kitchen
04:16 - remains at peak efficiency
04:17 - it features tons of unique levels where
04:19 - all kinds of events happen
04:21 - for example you're cooking on a boat
04:22 - then the boat moves and the whole
04:24 - kitchen changes shape
04:25 - keeping some people stuck on one side
04:27 - and someone another
04:28 - it really is a game that is 100 focused
04:30 - on co-op gameplay and ensures all the
04:32 - mechanics are designed for
04:34 - either maximum cooperation or maximum
04:36 - failure
04:37 - then for a game that resurrected the
04:39 - isometric tactics genre here is shadow
04:41 - tactics blades of the shogun
04:43 - for me i spent a good chunk of my
04:45 - childhood playing and replaying the
04:46 - commandos and desperados games
04:48 - so when i saw this game announced i was
04:50 - immediately hooked you control a bunch
04:52 - of unique characters each with their own
04:54 - stats and skills
04:55 - and you must complete various objectives
04:57 - on all kinds of interesting levels
04:59 - the guards all have their view cones
05:00 - visible so it's up to you to move all of
05:02 - your characters to the exact positions
05:04 - in order to execute your plans
05:06 - flawlessly use your skills to distract
05:08 - guards from their position
05:09 - then maybe take them down silently or
05:11 - use a high powered rifle that makes a
05:13 - ton of noise
05:14 - how you complete the missions is really
05:15 - up to you you can go guns blazing or
05:17 - slither through the shadows and take
05:19 - down all of the enemies quietly
05:20 - if you're a fan of strategy games and
05:22 - this is a must buy it's an excellent
05:24 - game that will definitely put your
05:25 - skills to the test
05:26 - next up if you're into giant heavy mechs
05:29 - here is battletech
05:30 - it's a turn-based strategy game where
05:32 - you take command of your mercenary
05:34 - outfit
05:34 - of mex and the mechwarriors that pound
05:36 - them deploy over 30 battlemechs in a
05:38 - wide variety of combinations
05:40 - use terrain positioning weapon selection
05:42 - and special abilities to outmaneuver and
05:45 - outplay your opponents
05:46 - games with giant max are pretty rare and
05:48 - this one certainly makes them look
05:49 - super cool they are giant and have a
05:52 - real sense of weight
05:53 - managing your crew and mercenary company
05:55 - is also very important
05:56 - recruit and customize your mech warriors
05:58 - take on missions and manage your
06:00 - reputation with a variety of no ball
06:02 - houses and local infections
06:04 - also features pvp and skirmish modes so
06:06 - if you're into games with lots of stats
06:08 - and thinking carefully before
06:10 - each action then this one is for you
06:12 - next here's a game that got a ton of
06:14 - awards
06:14 - otherwise it's a very mysterious unique
06:17 - game
06:18 - you are trapped in an endless time loop
06:20 - and it's up to you to figure out
06:21 - what is going on you're on this solar
06:23 - system and you have your spaceship with
06:25 - the ability to move between each planet
06:27 - and explore
06:28 - what's unique about them time is
06:30 - constantly looping with the same events
06:31 - repeating every time
06:33 - it's up to you to explore the various
06:35 - planets and find the mystery that hides
06:36 - within
06:37 - use a variety of unique gadgets to probe
06:39 - your surroundings
06:40 - track down mysterious signals decipher
06:42 - ancient alien writing and roast the
06:44 - perfect marshmallow
06:45 - it's got overwhelmingly positive reviews
06:48 - and it even won a bafta so this is the
06:49 - case of a very unique game being
06:51 - perfectly executed
06:53 - in terms of unity being used to make
06:55 - massive mmo games here is temtem
06:57 - it's a massive creature collection
06:59 - adventure game so think pokemon being
07:01 - made
07:02 - by an indie studio it definitely wears
07:04 - its inspiration on its sleeve
07:05 - but it used that as a jumping off point
07:07 - to expand upon that concept
07:09 - features a unique campaign and a fully
07:11 - online world where you can play with
07:13 - other players and go on adventures
07:15 - together buy your own house and decorate
07:17 - it just the way you like it
07:18 - pick your attention and fight in
07:20 - exciting turn-based battles
07:22 - as of this recording it is still in
07:24 - early access and constantly getting new
07:25 - content
07:26 - new missions events and new ways to play
07:28 - if misery and minimalism
07:30 - is what you're looking for then check
07:31 - out inside it's made by play dad the
07:34 - same makers of limbo
07:35 - it's a narrative driven platformer
07:37 - combining intense action with some very
07:39 - challenging puzzles
07:41 - you play as a little boy who finds
07:43 - himself in the center of a dark project
07:45 - features a very moody art style ambient
07:47 - soundtrack and
07:48 - unsettling atmosphere if you want to
07:50 - study the use of lighting
07:52 - shapes and clear level design then study
07:54 - this game even the store page
07:55 - description doesn't really say much
07:57 - it's a very mysterious game and also
07:59 - pretty short allowing you to complete it
08:01 - quickly and have a very enjoyable good
08:03 - time
08:03 - next up one of the best vr games this is
08:06 - boneworks
08:07 - it describes itself as an experimental
08:09 - physics vr
08:10 - adventure use found physics weapons
08:12 - tools and objects to fight across
08:14 - dangerous playscapes and a mysterious
08:16 - architecture
08:18 - the physicality of the world is really
08:19 - the main selling point it simulates all
08:21 - kinds of interaction systems as
08:23 - perfectly as possible
08:24 - for example use a crowbar to hook onto a
08:26 - ledge and climb
08:27 - up or use magnetic handles to climb your
08:30 - way through the map
08:31 - the characters all have accurate phone
08:33 - body ik systems to make every limb
08:35 - movement as realistic as possible
08:37 - and of course tons and tons of weapons
08:39 - that feel very satisfying to shoot
08:41 - you have standard guns but also all
08:43 - kinds of melee weapons
08:45 - energy weapons physics weapons and so on
08:47 - it's a game that really takes advantage
08:49 - of vr to make a completely new type of
08:51 - experience works on pretty much all vr
08:53 - headsets so if you have one definitely
08:55 - give this a shot
08:57 - then for a rare in the sequel that found
08:59 - massive success here is risk of rain 2.
09:01 - the original was not made with unity but
09:04 - for the sequel they went for a full 3d
09:06 - game and they choose unity as their
09:08 - engine
09:08 - it's a roguelike in every sense of the
09:10 - world features fast playthroughs
09:13 - randomized worlds
09:14 - randomized loot and tough-as-nails
09:16 - difficulty play solo or with friends
09:18 - so you'll land on this alien planet and
09:20 - do your best to survive using over 100
09:22 - items that make every run
09:24 - unique indie sequence are very tough to
09:26 - make many games cannot replicate their
09:28 - success with the second game but here
09:29 - they made it
09:30 - and beyond that the original game is in
09:32 - 2d and this one they jumped to 3d
09:35 - doing that change correctly is even more
09:36 - difficult but again the reviews are
09:38 - overwhelmingly positive so they
09:40 - definitely succeeded
09:41 - and one of the best indie studios around
09:43 - clay entertainment
09:44 - they normally use their own engine but
09:46 - decide to go with unity for this game
09:48 - oxygen not included it's a space colony
09:50 - simulation game
09:52 - you start off with a handful of
09:53 - colonists inside an underground alien
09:55 - space rock
09:56 - your crew will need to overcome all
09:58 - sorts of challenges encounter new life
10:00 - forms master science and research
10:02 - all kinds of space tech in order to
10:03 - survive it's a systems heavy game that
10:06 - demonstrates how complex you can go with
10:08 - unity
10:08 - it simulates oxygen levels on every
10:10 - position also features liquids which do
10:13 - flow from top to bottom
10:14 - it's got germ simulation gases building
10:17 - gathering mining
10:18 - power and tons more features lots of
10:20 - overlays so you can see all those
10:22 - systems in action
10:23 - your colonists have needs you need to
10:25 - keep them fed and happy and of course
10:27 - they need to have enough oxygen to
10:28 - survive
10:29 - it's a really detailed game and very
10:31 - random so every run is unique
10:33 - and again clay is one of the biggest
10:34 - most successful indie studios so the
10:36 - fact that they chose to go with unity
10:38 - after using their own custom engine for
10:39 - such a long time
10:41 - really proves just how good unt is
10:43 - alright there you have it
10:44 - 12 more super awesome games that
10:46 - showcase the power of the unity engine
10:48 - you can really build anything you can
10:50 - think of you can make excellent single
10:52 - player games like city scaling
10:54 - or massive multiplayer open worlds like
10:56 - temtem
10:57 - you can make complex systems like oxygen
10:59 - not included
11:00 - or simple minimalist games like inside
11:03 - you can make super physically accurate
11:04 - experiences like boneworks or some wacky
11:07 - good fun like overcoat
