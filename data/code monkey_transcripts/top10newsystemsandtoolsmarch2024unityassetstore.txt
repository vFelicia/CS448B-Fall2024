00:45 - out everything with the links in the
00:46 - description all right so starting off
00:48 - with a fun one a door system this one
00:50 - reminds me of the fun meme where some
00:52 - kind of Dev wants to implement the door
00:53 - in their game something that seems quite
00:55 - a simple task and soon enough they have
00:57 - a million things they need to do in
00:58 - order to make a simple door work and
01:00 - this asset is kind of showing exactly
01:01 - that it's a door system with a mountain
01:03 - of customization you can build all kinds
01:05 - of doors you can build rotating hinge
01:07 - doors sliding doors garage doors you can
01:09 - modify where we want to place the door
01:11 - pivot you can animate the opening and
01:13 - closing by modifying the position XY Z
01:15 - or some kind of rotation he can
01:17 - automatically detect when the player's
01:18 - in range and do a ton of stuff in the
01:20 - custom editor so this one really is a
01:22 - great example of how some tasks in Game
01:24 - Dev seem quite simple but in reality
01:26 - they actually have a ton of complexity
01:28 - next if you'd like to make game with
01:29 - lots of of movement interactions check
01:31 - out this system it's for handling all of
01:33 - your animations that have to do with
01:34 - movement making it look really seamless
01:36 - to Vault over a wall climb something or
01:38 - do a finisher move it looks really quite
01:40 - impressive the demo looks extremely
01:42 - natural with no jerky motion or sliding
01:44 - between each animation everything looks
01:46 - really perfect this works with any
01:48 - animation so including custom humanoid
01:50 - or generic animations either in place or
01:52 - with root motion this is a really very
01:54 - impressive asset if you have a game that
01:56 - is character based with lots of
01:57 - animations then this could help add that
01:59 - extra of Polish then if you were
02:01 - disappointed with the final release of
02:02 - skull and bones and if you'd like to
02:04 - make your own check out this naval
02:05 - battle kit you can controlly ship on the
02:07 - Open Seas you can sail around and
02:09 - explore or go into battle with some
02:11 - enemy AI ships the Ocean looks really
02:13 - gorgeous it's got some really high
02:15 - quality very realistic waves and the
02:17 - boats all have the correct buoyancy so
02:19 - just the Water by itself would be a
02:20 - great asset this one works on both PC
02:23 - and mobile if you just took this and
02:25 - then you got some Vision assets for some
02:27 - islands and a bunch more ships then this
02:29 - would be a really create starting point
02:30 - for some kind of pirate or trading game
02:32 - and then for a simple one that does one
02:34 - thing and does it extremely well here is
02:36 - the button animator Pro like name
02:38 - implies this helps you animate buttons
02:40 - that's it the custom editor looks really
02:42 - powerful very detailed there's lots of
02:44 - options for all kinds of events and
02:45 - actions you can easily add logic like
02:47 - making a button change color on Mouse
02:49 - over or change the scale on click then
02:51 - you can very easily copy paste the exact
02:53 - same behavior across multiple buttons
02:55 - adding some tiny animations to your
02:56 - clickable buttons is a super easy way to
02:59 - make your game look look a lot more
03:00 - polished so you should definitely use
03:01 - some kind of asset just like this one
03:03 - next if you want to build some kind of
03:05 - paths or objects on a grid then check
03:07 - out path Grid it's pretty simple it
03:08 - helps you build Road networks or pipes
03:10 - or Bridges really any kind of object on
03:12 - top of a grid the visuals adapt to the
03:14 - mesh underneath so this works great on
03:16 - top of the rins or other non-flat meshes
03:19 - this is one of those assets where if you
03:20 - wanted you could build it yourself for
03:22 - example if you follow my grid system
03:24 - tutorial videos if you do that you will
03:26 - be able to build this or if you just
03:27 - want to save some time you can simply
03:28 - buy this pre-built that'sa then here's a
03:31 - fun very specific one called cooking
03:33 - tulit you place down an object with a
03:35 - virtual collider box to den note the
03:37 - heat area then you can grab some
03:38 - hamburgers and place them on top to
03:40 - start cooking the objects have different
03:41 - states and they can seamlessly
03:43 - transition from uncooked to cooked to
03:45 - burned it also tracks cooking either
03:47 - uniformly kind of like a stove or just
03:49 - on one side like a pan so you can cook
03:51 - and flip around then you can also slice
03:53 - your food you can deep fry it in some
03:55 - liquid and really just view all these
03:56 - stats definitely this is a very strange
03:58 - very Niche asset but if You' like to
04:00 - make some kind of cooking game like
04:01 - perhaps some kind of VR cooking
04:03 - simulator then this would be a really
04:04 - great starting point next if you'd like
04:06 - to take some object that you have in
04:07 - real life and scanning into your game if
04:09 - so then here's an asset to help you do
04:11 - that you just grab your iPhone point at
04:13 - the object and select the area then just
04:15 - walk around the object very slowly the
04:17 - model is scanned piece by piece and in
04:19 - the end you have a pretty high quality
04:20 - model the mesh on the corners still
04:22 - doesn't look a little bit too sharp but
04:24 - the textures especially they look really
04:26 - great this is probably the best result
04:27 - that I've seen from any kind of app just
04:29 - like this the only limitation is how
04:30 - sadly it only works on iOS not Android
04:33 - makes me wonder if that's some kind of
04:34 - limitation in the sensor API or really
04:36 - just the fact that iPhones can sense up
04:38 - but most Androids can't then here's a
04:40 - bundle with a bunch of tools basically
04:42 - if you want to paint your objects and
04:43 - this includes three tools to paint it
04:45 - you can paint in 3D in 2D or just in the
04:47 - editor this kind of tool that is really
04:49 - great for fixing or slightly modifying
04:51 - some pre-made assets doing that can help
04:53 - make them quite a bit more unique or you
04:55 - can just give the player access to this
04:57 - tool in order to paint their car or
04:58 - their character or their home player
05:00 - customization is always a plus and with
05:02 - this it's pretty easy to implement in
05:03 - your game so this is a great asset to
05:05 - try out next if you like to make a card
05:07 - game here's a complete template to help
05:09 - you get started the game itself is kind
05:11 - of like heart zone so you have cards and
05:13 - creatures or Heroes on the board then
05:15 - each card has different stats that has
05:17 - all kinds of skills and those skills
05:19 - actually come with some great looking
05:20 - animations and effects and of course you
05:22 - can then extend with your own cards draw
05:24 - the cards Define some behaviors and
05:26 - create some kind of awesome effect this
05:28 - one is also ready for multiplayer with
05:30 - Lobby support and connection using
05:31 - Photon it also works on both PC Mobile
05:34 - and console and then if you have tons of
05:36 - Sprites in your game and you want to
05:37 - improve the performance check out this
05:39 - one basically this takes a ton of
05:41 - non-moving Sprites and baks them all
05:43 - into a single mesh just a single drwall
05:45 - which in turn improves performance quite
05:47 - a bit even when compared to the built-in
05:48 - batching you can combine Sprites with
05:50 - different textures colors materials and
05:52 - so on so this is an example of a simple
05:54 - very specialized tool that does one
05:56 - thing and does it very well all right so
05:58 - those are my top 10 new tools and
05:59 - systems on the unts store for March 24
