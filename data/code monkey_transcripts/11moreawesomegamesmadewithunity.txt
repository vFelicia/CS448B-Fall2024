00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - in this channel i normally cover
00:03 - tutorials for how you can build your own
00:05 - games in unity but in this video instead
00:07 - of doing it ourselves let's take some
00:09 - time to look at some great games that
00:10 - showcase the power and versatility of
00:12 - the unity engine
00:13 - this is actually the second video so if
00:15 - your favorites aren't here then maybe
00:17 - they're in the first one
00:18 - alright so when i watched the previous
00:19 - top 10 video most of the comments were
00:21 - saying where is hollow knight so here it
00:23 - is
00:23 - this is one of the biggest platformers
00:25 - of recent years it's got a look that
00:27 - stands out with an interesting unique
00:29 - world full of bug-like creatures
00:31 - and the most important thing of all is
00:32 - it's got some excellent very tight
00:34 - controls
00:34 - whether you fail or succeed is entirely
00:37 - up to you
00:38 - if you're a fan of platformers then this
00:39 - is without a doubt one of the best in
00:40 - the genre
00:41 - the upcoming sequel hollow knight song
00:43 - song is one of the most anticipated
00:45 - games and it is currently number four on
00:47 - this team's most wanted list
00:48 - again this is an indie game but it's
00:50 - fighting toe-toe with some of the
00:51 - biggest
00:51 - aaa titles and succeeding that's very
00:53 - inspiring for something hyper realistic
00:56 - you've got
00:56 - escape from tarkov another game that
00:58 - people are surprised to hear that it's
01:00 - made with unity
01:01 - this is a gorgeous looking hardcore
01:03 - survival multiplayer shooter
01:05 - you go on raids loot items and try to
01:07 - survive if you're into some high stakes
01:09 - pvp then this is just for you
01:11 - it came out in closed beta quite a while
01:13 - ago and it's been very successful on
01:14 - twitch since then
01:16 - it is still in that closed beta and in
01:18 - development with constant updates and it
01:20 - is also currently not available on steam
01:22 - so all this time they've been selling
01:24 - the game directly on their website
01:25 - so it's an excellent example of how with
01:27 - a really solid game you can still find
01:29 - success without seeing
01:30 - it's obviously extremely difficult but
01:32 - it can be done by the way if you find
01:34 - the video helpful please hit the like
01:36 - button
01:36 - it's a tiny thing but really does help
01:38 - thanks next up we've got super hot
01:41 - you can describe this game in one
01:42 - sentence and it's immediately appealing
01:44 - time only moves when you move that's it
01:46 - that's a very appealing concept
01:48 - combine that with the visuals that send
01:50 - out right away and you have yet another
01:52 - in the mega hit
01:53 - this one actually started off life as a
01:55 - game jam game so that's some excellent
01:57 - inspiration for you to take your own
01:58 - game jam games and see if maybe you can
02:00 - flash them out into a complete game
02:02 - game jams are usually great for coming
02:04 - up with some very unique concepts
02:06 - so if you do manage to come up with
02:07 - something really interesting then it
02:08 - might be worth it to push it forward
02:10 - also for this game you have not just the
02:12 - normal desktop version but also a vr
02:15 - version
02:15 - it is without a doubt one of the best vr
02:17 - games that you can buy
02:18 - if you are still skeptical about vr then
02:20 - all you need to do is play
02:22 - super hot vr and the second that you
02:24 - dodge a bullet like in the matrix you
02:25 - won't become a believer
02:26 - punching enemies slicing bolts in half
02:28 - and throwing bottles are such
02:30 - simple actions but so very satisfying if
02:32 - you have vr headset then you definitely
02:34 - need to try it

03:37 - here's the game that seemed to surprise
03:39 - everyone with how good it is
03:40 - genchin impact a lot of people were
03:43 - surprised with how this game that
03:44 - features such a massive open world is
03:46 - being made with yinti
03:48 - it is also an interesting game in that
03:49 - the initial reception went into its
03:51 - first revealed in a trailer
03:53 - that reception was somewhat negative
03:54 - with people saying it borrowed too much
03:56 - from breath of the wild to the point
03:57 - that it looked like a clone
03:59 - however as soon as it came out it sounds
04:01 - all of those criticisms that assume the
04:03 - game was just an uninspired clone
04:05 - instead what it is is definitely a game
04:07 - that takes great inspirations from other
04:09 - awesome games like worth the while
04:10 - but it uses those mechanics as a jumping
04:12 - off point and expands upon them in
04:13 - different ways
04:14 - the end result is a great game that has
04:16 - been very well received on both consoles
04:18 - pc and mobile
04:20 - it's very tricky to get all of those
04:21 - platforms right but they did do it
04:23 - it is also a free to play game which
04:25 - usually comes with a negative stigma but
04:27 - in this case people seem to find the
04:28 - monetization very well implement
04:30 - then if you're the kind of person who
04:32 - loves boss fights then you need to play
04:34 - fury
04:35 - it's a boss rush game just boss fight
04:37 - after boss fight
04:38 - every battle is unique and every boss
04:40 - has lots of different stages for you to
04:42 - learn and finally defeat
04:43 - features very tight controls and very
04:45 - satisfying combat mechanics
04:47 - timing is definitely key you must learn
04:49 - the patterns dodge incoming attacks and
04:51 - counter at the perfect time
04:53 - also features an interesting unique
04:54 - story in a mysterious world with some
04:56 - very good voice acting
04:58 - and an excellent soundtrack next up here
05:00 - is another huge recent mega hit
05:02 - among us it's a deception game you play
05:05 - with others and one person is the
05:06 - imposter
05:07 - you must do a bunch of tasks and either
05:09 - identify the imposter or if it's you
05:11 - then you need to eliminate everyone else
05:13 - it makes for some really interesting
05:15 - social gameplay and part of the fun is
05:17 - just talking to others and convincing
05:18 - them that you're not the imposter
05:20 - in the previous video like this one i
05:22 - highlighted the untitled goose game
05:23 - that's a game that found massive success
05:25 - in terms of marketing
05:26 - and among us is another example of how
05:28 - success can happen nowadays
05:30 - the game actually came out on the way
05:32 - back in 2018.
05:33 - it was doing alright but nothing too
05:35 - special then in 2020 it started getting
05:37 - picked up by some youtubers and getting
05:39 - really popular on twitch
05:40 - and all of a sudden the game took over
05:42 - the world also the developers are very
05:44 - smart
05:45 - when the game started blowing up they
05:46 - immediately canceled plans for a
05:48 - separate sequel that they were already
05:49 - working on
05:50 - and instead focus on their efforts to
05:52 - continually update this game and keep
05:54 - the momentum going
05:55 - finding success as an indie developer is
05:57 - very difficult so if you do manage to
05:59 - find it then make sure you grab it as
06:00 - hard as you can and don't let go
06:02 - for something that looks very inviting
06:04 - here is hitman go
06:06 - it's a hitman game where you play on a
06:08 - series of gorgeous looking dioramas
06:10 - it takes the head man formally you know
06:12 - and love and scales it down into a
06:14 - simple but effective turn based puzzle
06:16 - game
06:17 - so you still have disguises distractions
06:19 - sniper rifles and even the iconic silver
06:21 - ballers
06:22 - lots of enemy types with unique
06:23 - behaviors and different ways for
06:25 - completing each level
06:26 - either soundly or with force it's a
06:28 - great example of how you can take
06:30 - something and give it a twist to come up
06:32 - with something that is simultaneously
06:33 - familiar
06:34 - and still it feels fresh then a game
06:36 - made by a massive studio that decided to
06:38 - use unity for a side project
06:40 - here is gwent it's made by cd projekt
06:42 - red the makers of the witcher and
06:44 - cyberpunk
06:45 - it's a really awesome card game it first
06:47 - showed up as a mini game inside the
06:49 - witcher 3
06:49 - and people loved it so much that they
06:51 - expand upon it and made a standalone
06:53 - version
06:54 - you draw cards with various units and
06:55 - place them on separate positions on the
06:57 - battlefield
06:58 - i've never actually played the
06:59 - standalone version but it was always one
07:01 - of the best things that i loved in the
07:02 - witcher 3.
07:03 - i really like the design of the game
07:05 - even though usually i'm not into card
07:06 - games it's free to play and has received
07:08 - tons of updates since it first came out
07:10 - 4 years ago it's available on both pc
07:13 - and mobile
07:13 - then if you want to see something that
07:15 - pushes unity to its limits in terms of
07:17 - complexity then check out carbon space
07:19 - program
07:20 - it's a simulation game where your main
07:22 - goal is to build a spaceship that can
07:24 - actually fly
07:24 - they use proper realistic physics so not
07:27 - only is it fun to play but it's also
07:28 - educational and all of those series
07:31 - simulation mechanics are combined with
07:32 - some very similar characters so the vibe
07:34 - of the game is really enjoyable
07:36 - you build spaceships rockets and
07:37 - vehicles with tons of parts at your
07:39 - disposal each with their own function
07:41 - that will affect the way your spacecraft
07:42 - behaves construct space stations massive
07:45 - starships and bases on new planets
07:48 - it's a sandbox where you can spend
07:49 - hundreds of hours just tinkering with
07:51 - your creations
07:52 - originally came out in 2015 and it's got
07:55 - tons and tons of updates since then the
07:57 - last one was three months ago there's
07:59 - currently a sequel in development it's
08:02 - also using unity and promises to expand
08:04 - upon it in every way possible
08:05 - for something that suddenly became very
08:07 - popular thanks to recent events
08:09 - here is plagiance it's a strategy game
08:12 - where you create
08:12 - a pathogen and attempt to take over the
08:14 - world you choose from multiple types
08:17 - like viruses bacteria parasites and more
08:19 - each of them has their pros and cons to
08:21 - suit your preferred playstyle
08:23 - as you expand you gain skunk points to
08:24 - spend in mutations that have all kinds
08:26 - of effects
08:27 - it's a very unique concept and very well
08:29 - executed
08:30 - and because of those recent world events
08:32 - they made a free dlc that flips the game
08:34 - on its head
08:36 - it's named the cure and just like name
08:37 - implies your goal is to eliminate the
08:39 - virus and heal the world
08:40 - if you're into turn-based tactical games
08:42 - like xcom then phoenix point is a great
08:44 - new entry in the genre and it's made
08:46 - with unity
08:47 - you fight tactical battles on
08:49 - procedurally generated maps against a
08:51 - foe that adapts to your tactics
08:52 - manage diplomacy and economy on a global
08:55 - scale you must research
08:56 - explore and overcome your obstacles in
08:58 - order to succeed it's from the studio
09:00 - formed by the creator of the original
09:02 - xcom games
09:03 - it's a pretty complex game manage your
09:05 - action points carefully target the
09:06 - correct
09:07 - body parts and bring your soldiers back
09:08 - in life victory is not easy but it is
09:11 - satisfying
09:12 - alright so there you have it 11 more
09:14 - super awesome games that showcase the
09:16 - power of the unity engine
09:17 - you can really build anything that you
09:19 - can think of you can build small focused
09:21 - games like hitman go
09:22 - or massive worlds unlike engine impact
09:25 - you can make games with simple visuals
09:27 - like super hot or you can go hyper
