00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made within team launch in
00:05 - December 22. I thought the month of
00:07 - December would be pretty quiet but it's
00:09 - actually not it was tough to only pack
00:10 - 10 games and on top of that this month
00:12 - had several races that are using Unity
00:14 - dots so that's always awesome to see the
00:16 - reason why I make these videos is to
00:18 - show you everything that the engine can
00:19 - do the only limit is really just your
00:21 - own skills and Imagination and the
00:22 - variety and the awesomeness of the game
00:23 - shown here really puts out to the test
00:25 - all of these games are uniquely
00:26 - impressive so the list is in no
00:27 - particular order except for the number
00:29 - one game that is my personal pick of the
00:31 - month by the way I'm currently working
00:32 - on my own Sim game called Terminal 1
00:34 - Liberation it's a game with tons of
00:35 - systems open world survival and crafting
00:37 - automation strategy check out this steam
00:39 - page edit your wish list and follow for
00:40 - that one alright so starting off at
00:42 - number 10 with a game that is using
00:44 - Unity Dots here is ixion this is a
00:46 - Sci-Fi City Builder Survival game with
00:49 - tons and tons of moving pieces there's
00:50 - lots of robots flying around lots of
00:52 - conveyor belts it also has a focus on
00:54 - story so it's not just a Sandbox there
00:57 - is an actual storyline as you make the
00:59 - best decisions you can in order to help
01:00 - your crew survive there are huge summer
01:02 - maps to explore send out probes to
01:04 - reveal what is hidden do some mining to
01:06 - get some resources or some research to
01:08 - unlock new tech it has already managed
01:10 - to get over 6 000 reviews so this one is
01:12 - a huge hit although they are only mostly
01:14 - positive but if you're looking for
01:16 - something with a lot of complexity and a
01:17 - huge scale then this one looks great up
01:19 - next here is another one that is also
01:21 - using Indie dots this is generally car
01:23 - worlds I first saw this game on Twitter
01:25 - a couple of months ago through a really
01:26 - interesting video where the dev
01:28 - basically went through how the game
01:29 - works basically everything that you see
01:31 - here all these shapes they are wrong
01:32 - really just points that's how dots is
01:34 - used every single one of these thousands
01:36 - of points is a single entity then the
01:38 - game itself feels very natural in jelly
01:40 - everything squishes and stretches it's
01:42 - really fun to play around the physics
01:44 - and watch as a car is crushed and then
01:46 - bounce back into existence it even has a
01:48 - really fun feature where you can record
01:49 - your microphone and change any of these
01:51 - sound effects in the game it's a very
01:53 - inventive mechanic that personally fits
01:55 - the silliness of the home game for
01:56 - something a lot more Jolly here is
01:58 - little Gator game if you like fun and
02:00 - Adventure Platformers then this is a
02:01 - game for you you jump around meet some
02:03 - friends interact with animals you have
02:05 - lots of movement abilities to get around
02:07 - in this adorable world so you can climb
02:09 - you can swim Glide and slide all over
02:11 - the place as you meet new and
02:13 - interesting characters in your travel if
02:14 - you're tired of the stresses of every
02:16 - day then this seems like a great way to
02:17 - spend a jolly afternoon it has 1 000
02:20 - overwhelmingly positive reviews with a
02:22 - 99 score so this one is already one of
02:24 - the best reviewed games of all time next
02:26 - up here we have Knights of Honor
02:28 - Sovereign according to cvdb this game is
02:30 - also using entities although I can't
02:32 - quite figure out how it is a medieval
02:34 - strategy game it has a map layer and a
02:37 - real-time strategy layer so you manage
02:39 - your provinces gather armies try some
02:41 - diplomacy or some Espionage the battles
02:43 - are all pretty massive with tons and
02:45 - tons of units fighting all over the
02:46 - place I guess that's maybe where they're
02:48 - using entities visually the game also
02:50 - looks really good both the expression
02:52 - layer and the real-time combat they also
02:54 - promise that the gameplay is Grand
02:55 - strategy but accessible on Grand
02:57 - strategy so if you have trouble getting
02:58 - into these kinds of games and could be a
03:01 - fun entry point then for some VR here is
03:03 - downtown it's a language learning game
03:05 - it looks like a fun mix where it teaches
03:07 - you the words and phrases but then also
03:09 - asks you to perform the action so it's
03:11 - really nice you can have an old lady
03:12 - telling you she doesn't like rodents and
03:14 - then it's up to you to pick them up and
03:16 - throw them away it even use the
03:17 - microphone to test your actual speaking
03:19 - skills so this one looks like a fun way
03:21 - to learn a new language it features
03:22 - Japanese Chinese Spanish French German
03:25 - and Italian for me I've been casually
03:27 - learning Japanese on Duolingo for about
03:29 - a year now so I'd love to try this out
03:31 - and see how it differs then here's a
03:32 - game that shocked me a bit with how it's
03:34 - doing it's called stewardship it's a
03:36 - really soundlish very unique Shoot Em Up
03:38 - With a Twist which is that it's actually
03:40 - a Dodge Mount you fly a really slick
03:42 - spaceship and there are enemies firing
03:44 - at you you have no attacks yourself so
03:46 - you need to position your ship so that
03:47 - the enemies destroy each other it's a
03:49 - really interesting premise and seems
03:51 - very well produced the game oozes a very
03:53 - awesome art style I really like all the
03:55 - visuals of the effects in this game
03:56 - seems to have lots of upgrades that work
03:58 - really well with the core game mechanic
04:00 - however this game really shocked me
04:01 - because one looks great and unique it's
04:03 - also doing very importantly it only has
04:05 - 33 reviews which means it really hasn't
04:07 - sold very well I thought maybe the issue
04:09 - was like a wish list but it seems in
04:11 - launched with around 7000 which is a
04:12 - pretty decent number the genre is
04:14 - definitely a bit Niche on Steam shoot em
04:16 - ups or both Hound Shooters are somewhat
04:18 - small on seam so maybe that's it the
04:19 - game does look really great so hopefully
04:21 - over time it will find an audience and
04:23 - end up with a really nice long tail up
04:25 - next here we have zombie cure lab I
04:27 - can't believe no one has done this
04:28 - concept before it's a management game
04:30 - with zombies where the goal is not to
04:32 - kill all the zombies rather to cure them
04:34 - it's a really interesting premise it has
04:36 - all the mechanics you expect from a
04:37 - management game there's lots of
04:39 - buildings to do all kinds of things you
04:40 - have human scientists that operate those
04:42 - buildings and can research to unlock all
04:44 - kinds of new technologies there are
04:46 - still aggressive zombies so you do need
04:48 - to defend your base but rather than
04:49 - taking them all out you need to capture
04:51 - a bunch of them and start the process to
04:53 - convert them from a zombie into a human
04:55 - just based on the concept alone I'm
04:57 - already interested and Beyond the unique
04:59 - concept it also means seems very well
05:00 - made with very positive reviews it just
05:02 - came out into Early Access so I'd love
05:04 - to give this one a try when I have some
05:06 - time next up for something very visually
05:08 - striking here is Project downfall it's a
05:10 - bit of a weird name but it looks like a
05:12 - very well made first person shooter with
05:14 - some unique visuals features lots of
05:16 - satisfying destruction the Gunplay feels
05:18 - very weighty very powerful the game has
05:20 - a sound mechanic so you get bonus points
05:22 - for headshots which also enable bullet
05:24 - time for some really awesome moves the
05:26 - description has a surprisingly large
05:28 - amount of lore so while it looks like
05:29 - the main focus is on the gameplay
05:31 - apparently it does have an interesting
05:32 - story it features leaderboards if you're
05:34 - into that sort of thing very Hardcore
05:36 - gameplay with no Health Region at all
05:38 - lots of Combos and a sanity system it
05:40 - just came out of Early Access and
05:42 - reviews are very positive then if you
05:44 - want maximum complexity here is final
05:46 - upgrade it's a very generic name but the
05:48 - game itself looks very compelling just
05:50 - one look at the trailer and you can
05:51 - immediately tell what kind of game it is
05:53 - you have tons of units flying around
05:54 - lots of complex interlock systems you
05:57 - can mine for resources terraform planets
05:59 - and conquer the Galaxy seeing the scale
06:01 - of the game is truly massive I tried to
06:03 - Google to see if this game is also using
06:04 - dots but I couldn't find anything it's
06:06 - really complex with tons and tons of
06:08 - logic and systems so perhaps it's using
06:10 - some kind of custom ECS logic I quite
06:12 - like the uniqueness of the vertical
06:13 - layout at least to me the game looks
06:15 - more vertical rather than an overhead
06:17 - view so basically if you like these
06:18 - kinds of games with tons of moving parts
06:20 - and conflict systems then this looks
06:22 - like an excellent new entry in genre and
06:24 - at number one for my personal pick month
06:25 - here is a huge hit that just came out of
06:27 - Early Access here is potioncraft this
06:30 - was in Early Access for a little over a
06:31 - year in that time it got tons and tons
06:33 - of updates based on feedback from the
06:35 - community the game has some very unique
06:37 - mechanics it's an alchemist Simulator
06:39 - game so you need to gather all kinds of
06:40 - plants and actually use your tools to
06:42 - brew all kinds of potions the entire
06:44 - game has a very manual very satisfying
06:46 - feel it's up to you to invent new
06:48 - recipes and attract new customers the
06:49 - crafting system works really interesting
06:51 - very complex as you include ingredients
06:53 - the potion quote unquote moves on the
06:55 - map which leads to the final result I
06:56 - definitely would like to play this one
06:58 - to explore all of these Unique Mechanics
06:59 - certainly looks like a very unique game
07:01 - it has already gathered over 14 000 very
07:03 - positive reviews in the past year and
07:05 - even though they just launched out of
07:07 - Early Access they still have an active
07:09 - roadmap so if you enjoy the game you
07:10 - will have lots of content to play for a
07:12 - long time alright so that's 10 awesome
07:14 - new games made with DNT and launch in
07:16 - December 22. I hope this lists how to
07:18 - see how the NT engine is capable of
07:19 - building anything the only limits are
07:21 - really just your own skills and your own
07:22 - imagination check out my own Sim game
07:24 - turnover Liberation and edit your
07:26 - wishlist alright hope that's useful
