00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your K monkey and
00:02 - here it is all the advanced lectures in
00:03 - my complete C course around right now I
00:05 - just published the last 22 Advanced
00:07 - lectures this cover topics like ASN
00:09 - programming unsafe code nulls
00:11 - multi-threading and a bunch more so this
00:13 - update makes the course fully complete
00:14 - it starts from the absolute Basics like
00:16 - teaching how exactly does code run line
00:18 - by line and what is a variable then
00:20 - teach you some more intermediate topics
00:21 - things like events and interfaces and
00:23 - I'll finally the advaned section this
00:25 - one teaching lots of very interesting C
00:26 - features that you might not know about
00:28 - in total in the complete course there
00:29 - are 97 lectures 587 frequently asked
00:32 - questions 567 quizzes and 177
00:35 - interactive exercise this really is very
00:37 - complete I put my 10 years of C
00:39 - knowledge in this one course so if you
00:41 - know absolutely nothing about C and you
00:42 - go through this course and if you do it
00:44 - by taking it slowly bit by bit making
00:46 - sure you understand everything along the
00:47 - way if you do all of that and by the end
00:50 - you will have gained an awesome skill
00:51 - set now personally I love C it's a
00:53 - really great language I really love the
00:54 - syntax and it can be used for just about
00:56 - anything you can make games you can make
00:58 - console apps websites you can do things
01:00 - in AI iot Robotics and really anything
01:02 - so I definitely believe you should learn
01:04 - the language and you should learn
01:05 - everything the language can do and also
01:06 - like I mentioned in the very beginning
01:07 - when I first announced this course my
01:09 - goal for this was to have fre versions
01:11 - over here on YouTube but actually before
01:12 - that let's just see a quick overview of
01:14 - the advanced lectures we're going to
01:15 - start off with an interesting Advanced
01:17 - topic that I actually only started
01:19 - seriously using just recently it's
01:20 - reflection I had to learn this myself in
01:22 - order to make the exercis for the
01:24 - companion project reflection is how you
01:26 - can dynamically inspect your code and
01:27 - work with it without directly calling
01:29 - any function functions or reading any
01:30 - Fields next is going to be a simple but
01:32 - interesting one it's how you can make
01:34 - some function extensions this allows you
01:36 - to extend a type with more functions
01:38 - without having to modify that type
01:40 - itself this is really useful when you
01:42 - don't have access to the type itself
01:43 - when you don't have source code access
01:45 - then we're going to learn about static
01:47 - Constructors these are kind of like the
01:49 - normal Constructor but they run just
01:51 - once for the entire class after that
01:53 - we're going to learn about the type of
01:55 - keyword this lets us get a system. type
01:57 - object of any type that we have this is
02:00 - very important to use alongside
02:01 - reflection then in lecture on name of
02:04 - this one helps you get a string name for
02:06 - some kind of type this is really useful
02:08 - to help you avoid strings in your code
02:10 - next is the size of operator this one
02:12 - lets you get the size of your types like
02:14 - for example you can see how an INT is
02:16 - four bytes a short is two bytes and a
02:18 - BTE is just a single BTE so this helps
02:20 - you know how much memory your code will
02:22 - use then in lecture on default simple
02:25 - and very useful way to get the default
02:27 - value of some type if you do default of
02:28 - an INT you get zero if you do the
02:30 - default of a ball you get false if you
02:32 - do the default of some object you get
02:33 - null and so on so using this keyword is
02:35 - much better than hardcoding some default
02:37 - values after that we're going to have a
02:39 - lecture on expression bodied members
02:42 - this is a really interesting very
02:43 - compact way to write simple short
02:45 - functions there's no need to write all
02:47 - the usual function boilerplate code this
02:50 - one is basically just a Lambda after
02:52 - that we're going to see a lecture on
02:53 - records this is a super simple way to
02:55 - create immutable types to organize your
02:57 - data next we're going to learn about the
02:59 - null conditional operators this is how
03:01 - you can easily test for null before
03:03 - doing something like for example before
03:05 - firing off an event then a lecture on
03:06 - the null coing operator this one lets
03:09 - you quickly test against null and if it
03:11 - is null return the default value after
03:13 - that we're going to learn about the tary
03:15 - conditional operator this is an
03:17 - excellent super compact Syntax for
03:18 - making a very simple if you have the
03:21 - condition with an if and an L so it's
03:22 - all very tiny very useful next we're
03:24 - going to learn about the main function
03:26 - in a console app and how to pass in some
03:28 - command line arguments this is a really
03:30 - important one because there are many
03:32 - interesting programs that you can build
03:33 - that don't need any kind of UI so a
03:36 - simple console app that you can control
03:37 - with some command line arguments that
03:39 - one is always going to be an excellent
03:40 - option then in lecture on nullable this
03:43 - is how you can make any type support
03:44 - null even value types like an or ball
03:48 - you can make them nullable to support
03:49 - null this can be much better than having
03:51 - to predefine some special value
03:53 - something like minus one next we're
03:54 - going to see a lecture on span this is a
03:57 - super efficient way to do Logic on array
04:00 - or slices of arrays importantly is how
04:02 - this does not actually create any new
04:04 - data it does not cost any new memory
04:06 - does not create a new object this one is
04:08 - basically just a pointer meaning it is
04:10 - insanely performant then in lecture on
04:12 - bitwise operators this is how you can
04:15 - work with individual bits of data in
04:17 - this lecture I'm also going to teach the
04:18 - basics for how binary works next we're
04:21 - going to learn about enum Flags this is
04:23 - how you can turn your enom into bit
04:25 - masks which then allows you to make some
04:27 - interesting combinations then a lecture
04:29 - on pre-process processor directives with
04:31 - this we can give orders to the compiler
04:32 - itself we can Define symbols and include
04:35 - or not include some code in the
04:37 - compilation next in lecture on the
04:39 - keywords ref out and in these are really
04:41 - useful they help you get more that out
04:43 - of a function than just a single return
04:45 - type and they also help you work with
04:48 - types as references even if they are
04:50 - valid types after that we're going to
04:52 - learn about data boxing now this does
04:54 - not have anything to do with punching
04:56 - people it's really all about putting
04:57 - data inside a box this is an interesting
05:00 - property based on the fact that
05:01 - everything in C extends from object next
05:04 - we're going to learn about Dynamic this
05:06 - is a really interesting very Advanced
05:07 - topic with Dynamic we can work with
05:10 - types that don't actually exist so we
05:12 - can define something as Dynamic and call
05:14 - functions or read films on that type on
05:17 - that object even if they don't really
05:18 - exist that validation logic is only
05:20 - going to run at runtime not at compound
05:22 - time so this Dynamic this is really
05:24 - useful especially when working with data
05:26 - you got from some kind of web server
05:28 - then a lecture on the class indexer with
05:31 - this you can make your own custom type
05:32 - support access through an index just
05:34 - like a list or array you can add
05:36 - whatever logic you want and make it read
05:38 - only or read right next is a lecture on
05:40 - attributes with this you can add
05:42 - metadata to your code then that metadata
05:45 - can represent whatever you want you can
05:47 - use reflection to analyze it and do
05:49 - something to it after that is a lecture
05:51 - on Anonymous types really interesting
05:53 - quick way of organizing some data
05:55 - without having to First Define a
05:56 - specific type you just do new open up
05:59 - the braces and it will automatically
06:01 - create a generated type related to that
06:03 - is the next lecture on tupon these are
06:06 - very similar they also allow you to
06:08 - organize some data without first
06:09 - defining a type in this lecture I also
06:11 - cover the differences between Anonymous
06:13 - types and tupon next is going to be a
06:15 - lecture on using I disposable this is a
06:17 - really interesting code block and
06:19 - interface that helps you make sure you
06:21 - don't forget any kind of cleanup code
06:23 - after that we're going to learn how to
06:24 - create custom override operators using
06:26 - these we can add support for our own
06:28 - classes to do things like addition or
06:30 - multiplication we can Define the logic
06:32 - of what exactly it means to add two
06:34 - custom player classes together and also
06:36 - Define the logic for comparing two
06:37 - custom types meaning defining the logic
06:39 - for what exactly thises mean to do an
06:41 - equals next is in lecture on link with
06:44 - link we can easily do query operations
06:46 - on any collection of data whether it be
06:48 - a list or array or some XML or some kind
06:50 - of database we grab that data then we
06:53 - can query for some conditions and select
06:55 - just a few elements we can sort some
06:57 - things we can do a union and so on if
06:59 - you're familiar with SQL then link will
07:00 - be quite familiar afterwards we're going
07:02 - to learn about Wind forms this is how
07:05 - you can make visual C programs you have
07:07 - your toolbox and you just drag and drop
07:09 - the components here I'm also going to
07:11 - talk about the other visual program
07:12 - tools things like WPF and net Maui as
07:16 - well as how Unity itself doesn't have to
07:18 - be used just for making games you can
07:19 - make normal applications with unity next
07:21 - is going to be a lecture on dlll import
07:24 - the elaborate import how to use exter
07:26 - and work with the windows API so this
07:28 - one is going to be a great like leure to
07:29 - learn how to interact with external
07:31 - libraries then a lecture on asserts and
07:33 - unit testing in general with this you
07:35 - can validate your own code to make sure
07:37 - everything is behaving exactly as
07:38 - intended next is going to be a lecture
07:40 - on writing unsafe C code and working
07:43 - with pointers now this one this is a
07:45 - very very Advanced topic technically if
07:47 - you know what you're doing you can make
07:49 - some impressive stuff with unsafe code
07:51 - but C has a safety for a reason so
07:53 - definitely only use this wisely then
07:55 - we're going to learn about as
07:56 - synchronous programming specifically how
07:58 - to use async a wait and task this is how
08:01 - you can have some code that takes some
08:02 - time like for example contacting a web
08:04 - server and keep waiting for a response
08:06 - without blocking your program this is
08:09 - extremely important in making sure your
08:10 - program feels nice and responsive after
08:12 - that comes a super important Advanced
08:14 - lecture this one is all about
08:15 - multi-threading this is how you can take
08:17 - advantage of all the cores in a CPU to
08:19 - make them all do work at the exact same
08:21 - time when then properly you can get some
08:24 - insane performance improvements but it
08:26 - is also very very easy to make mistakes
08:28 - so this one is very much a definition of
08:30 - an advanced topic where you must know
08:32 - exactly what you're doing so that's
08:33 - everything we learn in the advanced
08:35 - section as you can see there's lots of
08:36 - really interesting topics all the
08:38 - lectures are already available so if you
08:39 - already have the course just open the
08:40 - page and you'll see new lectures right
08:42 - away and if you don't have the course
08:43 - you can pick it up with the link in
08:44 - description or alternatively like I
08:46 - mentioned many months ago when I first
08:47 - announced this course the goal was to
08:49 - have a premium version and a free
08:50 - version basically if enough people
08:52 - bought the premium version if so then I
08:53 - would make the video lectures free here
08:55 - on YouTube and yep I'm happy to say that
08:57 - it did surpass my thresholds that is why
08:59 - both the the beginner and the
09:00 - intermediate version those are already
09:01 - free over here on YouTube so now I'm
09:03 - launching the advance section on the
09:04 - premium version and the free video
09:06 - containing the video lectures for the
09:07 - Advent section that won't be coming out
09:08 - in one month now if you can afford the
09:10 - premium version that's a great option it
09:11 - includes the companion project which
09:13 - contains a ton of frequently asked
09:15 - questions a bunch of quizzes and
09:16 - importantly some very interactive
09:17 - exercises these certainly help you learn
09:19 - by doing instead of just watching videos
09:21 - then obviously the premium version has
09:23 - no ads you also get access to the
09:24 - private Discord community and the wickly
09:26 - private live streams where I answer all
09:28 - your questions so if you can't for the
09:29 - premium version or if you already have
09:30 - then that's awesome I hope it helps you
09:32 - a ton it's linked in the description but
09:34 - if not then that's okay you can already
09:35 - go watch a free beginner and
09:37 - intermediate section for free here on
09:38 - YouTube and a free YouTube video with
09:40 - the advance section that will be coming
09:41 - out in one month now I'm really happy
09:43 - with how this course came out it covers
09:44 - lots of topics and I think it actually
09:46 - has a really nice smooth learning curve
09:48 - so wherever you are in your Learning
09:49 - Journey beginner intermediate or advance
09:51 - I am sure you can learn something from
09:52 - this I really do love CP I think it's an
09:54 - excellent language I think it's a very
09:56 - valuable skill to have it really gives
09:57 - you the power to build so many awesome
09:59 - things so I truly hope that this course
10:01 - both the free and the paid versions I
10:03 - really hope it helps you gain that very
10:04 - valuable skill all right so thanks for
10:06 - watching and I'll see you next time
