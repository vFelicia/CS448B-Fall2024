00:31 - check it out to the link in the
00:32 - description alright so on to the top 10
00:33 - list starting off with a very impressive
00:35 - one it's a runtime console this one
00:37 - looks extremely robust for a free tool
00:39 - you can see the console in runtime this
00:42 - is extremely useful especially for
00:43 - multiplayer games where you need to make
00:45 - a build and you don't have access to the
00:47 - editor console on this one you can read
00:49 - on logs you can pin in some messages
00:51 - display any custom data you can easily
00:53 - create lots of visual panels and display
00:55 - whatever that you want you can add some
00:57 - sliders or bars literally anything this
00:59 - one is honestly really impressive for a
01:01 - free asset next here is the latest free
01:03 - Unity simple it's a 2d project that is
01:05 - meant to Showcase all of the latest
01:07 - Unity 2D tools this one has an emphasis
01:09 - on 2D and lights showcasing how you can
01:12 - set up a day night cycle and get some
01:14 - pretty interesting effects it's got an
01:16 - interesting visual Style with lots of
01:17 - bevels to really make the enlightening
01:19 - effects send out so there are lots of
01:20 - normal textures being used everywhere it
01:22 - has some interesting custom shaders with
01:24 - 2D particles made in the VFX graph you
01:27 - use the town map light masks the
01:29 - character also has some 2D bones and
01:31 - multiple directions so no this room
01:32 - looks like a very complete 2D sample if
01:34 - you'd like to learn all about these
01:36 - Unity 2D tools then this is a great
01:38 - project to inspect next for something in
01:40 - 3D here is a control rig basically this
01:42 - uses unity's animation rigging package
01:44 - and with one click automatically sets up
01:47 - all kinds of constraints so you can move
01:49 - your character in many ways it
01:50 - automatically adds head ik so you can
01:53 - look in any direction it adds ik to the
01:55 - hands so you can grab anything for ik to
01:57 - place them correctly manually setting up
01:59 - on of the ik4 character like this doing
02:01 - all this usually takes a ton of work so
02:04 - being able to settle this up with just
02:06 - one click sounds like a huge Time Saver
02:07 - and again it's only a free tool so it's
02:09 - very impressive if you find this useful
02:11 - check out the other tools by this same
02:12 - developer then if you need a simple fun
02:14 - stylized character check out this one it
02:16 - looks nice it's a very simple design but
02:18 - very well made and if you like this
02:20 - style then this dev has tons more on
02:22 - this same style and with modular parts
02:23 - for another interesting system here is a
02:26 - third person controller looks very well
02:28 - built extremely impressive and again

02:34 - system it's also got foot ik use the new
02:37 - input system and even has a zipline
