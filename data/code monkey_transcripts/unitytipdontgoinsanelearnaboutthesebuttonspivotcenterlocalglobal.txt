00:00 - here's a quick unity tip do you know
00:01 - what these two buttons do
00:03 - if not then you're bound to go insane at
00:04 - some point this button changes from
00:06 - pivot to center and this one from local
00:08 - to global
00:09 - if you don't know about that then you
00:10 - might go crazy when you try to rotate
00:12 - some object and it's not rotating along
00:14 - where the tool handle is
00:16 - that is because this two only set to
00:17 - center and not pivot
00:19 - it's the same thing with the rotation if
00:21 - the parent object is rotated and this
00:22 - one is set to global
00:23 - then you see the normal handles so for
00:25 - example it's very tricky to move this
00:27 - object along the parent's rotation axis
00:29 - however if you swap it on local now the
00:31 - handles are rotated to match the object
00:33 - rotation
00:34 - you can now easily move the child along
00:35 - the parent axis and here's a bonus tip
00:38 - unity now has snapping by default which
00:40 - you enable by clicking this button
00:42 - however it's only active if the rotation
00:44 - is set to global so if you can't enable
00:46 - snapping make sure it's set to global
00:47 - alright hope that's useful subscribe for
