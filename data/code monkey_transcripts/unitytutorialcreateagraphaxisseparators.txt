00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're continuing to
00:03 - create a graph in unity we're going to
00:06 - add some separators to our x and y axes
00:08 - to make our graph easier to read
00:10 - let's get started
00:14 - so we previously created this graph here
00:17 - which is displaying all of our values
00:19 - our valleys are represented in code as a
00:21 - list of integers right now we can't
00:23 - really tell what values does each not
00:25 - represent just by looking at it what
00:27 - we're missing is a visual for the scale
00:29 - of the x and y axis so essentially very
00:32 - separators on each value so back in my
00:35 - editor here on my window graph I'm going
00:38 - to go into my graph container and create
00:40 - a game object inside it and essentially
00:43 - I'm going to create a template for the
00:45 - text that I'm going to use to display
00:47 - the x and y axes so in here let's call
00:50 - it from label template essentially this
00:52 - is a game object that we're going to
00:54 - copy/paste in order to display all our
00:56 - various labels so in here I'm going to
00:59 - add a text component make it overflows
01:02 - no what no hi let me anchor it to the
01:05 - lower left sign so right there and for
01:09 - text let's say a random number and this
01:12 - one will be the label template for the x
01:15 - axis which won't be aligned in the
01:18 - center okay so this is what we're going
01:20 - to use to copy/paste and let's duplicate
01:23 - one make a live label template for the Y
01:27 - and align this one to the right and the
01:30 - middle okay so now let's disable these
01:33 - game objects since we only want to use
01:35 - them in order to copy paste and we don't
01:37 - want the templates to actually be
01:39 - visible so now that we have our labels
01:42 - for our axis separators let's go back
01:45 - into our code here and in here when we
01:48 - have our show graph when we are creating
01:51 - the circle we're going to create our
01:53 - separators let's start off with one on
01:55 - the x-axis since that's the easiest
01:58 - essentially the x axis separator is only
02:01 - one per index so after we spawn a circle
02:04 - let's just duplicate our x axis label so
02:07 - first of all let's go up here and grab
02:09 - reference to my rect transform for the
02:12 - label template X and
02:15 - simply on the Y and we're going to grab
02:17 - our references in here they are inside
02:20 - the grab container fine little template
02:23 - bags get component rect transform do the
02:26 - same for the wine okay so I have my
02:29 - references to my own labels that I'm
02:31 - going to duplicate so go down here and
02:34 - I'm going to make a rect transform for
02:38 - my own label X which will be the
02:40 - instantiation of that template label X
02:45 - dot set parent set the parent to my
02:48 - graph container I have to go into my
02:51 - game object and set the active to true
02:53 - since my template is disabled and now
02:56 - let's go into my anchored position which
03:00 - won't be in terms of the X will be at
03:02 - the same X as our circle game object but
03:05 - for the eye it won't be under the bottom
03:07 - of our graph so let's say - 20 M and
03:10 - finally going to label X I get component
03:14 - of type text and we're going to set the
03:17 - text to be essentially our I I dot -
03:20 - string okay so back into our scene and
03:23 - let's see if the labels are showing you
03:25 - yep there you can see our x-axis
03:28 - correctly aligned with our dots and they
03:32 - are displaying the index of each of our
03:34 - dots
03:34 - okay let's shift them a bit upwards but
03:37 - in terms of logic everything is working
03:38 - as we want okay so now that we have the
03:41 - X axes labels working let's take care of
03:44 - the y axis here it's a bit more
03:46 - complicated first we need to decide how
03:48 - many separators we're going to have so
03:50 - let's make an int separator count and
03:53 - let's say I'm going to have ten
03:55 - separators for the vertical axis of my
03:57 - graph so in here let me cycle through
04:00 - all of my separators oh it's been a
04:03 - separator count I plus one okay and now
04:06 - in here I'm going to spawn a label but
04:09 - this will be the label Y and based on
04:12 - the label template Y and on my anchor
04:16 - position for my X I'm simply going to
04:18 - shift it to the left side so let's say -
04:20 - 7 F and now for my Y I need to calculate
04:24 - where this separator won't be in the
04:26 - graph so let me grab a normalized
04:29 - you for this particular index so let's
04:32 - make a float normalized value which will
04:36 - be the I divided by my separator count
04:39 - since these are two ends let's convert
04:41 - one of them into a float by multiplying
04:43 - by one so this will be a normalized
04:45 - value between zero and one of this index
04:47 - based on this many separate accounts so
04:50 - now that I have a value between zero and
04:52 - one in order to position it vertically
04:54 - all I need to is multiply that normalize
04:56 - value by my graph height so if this is
04:59 - one then it's gonna be on my graph
05:01 - height and for my text I don't want to
05:04 - display the index but rather the value
05:07 - that this separator represents so I'm
05:09 - going to make my normalized value
05:11 - multiplied by the Y maximum so if it is
05:14 - one this will display the y maximum
05:16 - which in this case is a hundred let's
05:18 - just round off our value and make it two
05:23 - string okay so we have defined a number
05:27 - of separators we in sin she ate our
05:30 - unleavened template we set the parent we
05:33 - set it into active we calculate the
05:35 - normalized value of this index we
05:38 - position it on the left side and in the
05:40 - correct Y position and for the text we
05:44 - multiply the normalized value by our Y
05:46 - maximum we round it off to an end and we
05:49 - convert it into a string okay
05:50 - let's see if our code is working yep
05:53 - there you go you can see we are dividing
05:55 - by ten since we have to find our y
05:58 - maximum as a hundred and we got ten
06:00 - separators then each of them is 10 so 10
06:03 - 20 30 and so on and our axe axe ez is
06:06 - also correctly displaying every value we
06:09 - want to have am live on tops and let's
06:11 - just say minus or equals but everything
06:13 - else looks okay so first of all in order
06:16 - to have it let's put minus equals and
06:18 - now it should display the hundred as
06:20 - well okay yeah there you okay great so
06:24 - now that we have both of our axes with
06:26 - our own labels let's set some dashes so
06:28 - we can easily follow the separators with
06:30 - our eyes okay so let's create a new
06:32 - template for my dashes that we can then
06:35 - duplicate it so going to my graph
06:37 - container and create a new empty game
06:39 - object and name it
06:41 - - template X okay so this will have a
06:44 - image component and I have been here a
06:46 - texture of the - which is just you know
06:48 - half in white half transparent going to
06:51 - set the height to let's say three and
06:53 - set it to be very transparent so just
06:56 - about just about there
06:58 - and set the image type to Thailand and
07:01 - I'm going to anchor it to the left side
07:03 - the pivot to the left side but the
07:05 - anchor on the bottom right there and
07:08 - there you go I have my dashes and I can
07:10 - modify the width to occupy the whole
07:12 - thing so let's put it a bit to the left
07:15 - so it matches with the labels and
07:17 - shifted completely to the right yep
07:19 - there you go exactly so I have my -
07:22 - template everything is working correctly
07:23 - so well it's duplicated to make our Y
07:26 - and set this to disabled so let's make -
07:29 - template 40 Y and let's just rotate it
07:33 - 90 degrees so it's facing upwards and
07:35 - for my Y yeah I'm going to place about
07:38 - in there so I might say minus 4 on the
07:41 - line and for my height let me place it
07:44 - okay there you go I have my vertical and
07:46 - my horizontal dashes so let's again
07:49 - raise this back into our code and first
07:52 - of all we need our references so make a
07:55 - private rect transform
07:56 - - template X and - template Y and grab
08:00 - the references in here okay we grabbed
08:03 - our references now in here when I'm
08:05 - creating the label I'm going to do the
08:07 - same thing to create my - template X and
08:12 - call it - X and let's remove the set
08:16 - text and there you we are positioning in
08:19 - there and in there okay so I have my X -
08:23 - is correctly being spawned now let's
08:25 - take care of the Y so in here when I'm
08:27 - creating the why label let's create a -
08:31 - for my Y in sin she ate the - template
08:34 - for the Y and for my exposition let's
08:37 - just put it on - for and for the Y will
08:39 - be the same as my label
08:41 - okay okay so we are now adding the
08:44 - dashes at the same time as we add the
08:46 - labels and in here the same thing so
08:48 - let's test it and we should now see
08:50 - dashes on both axes all right there you
08:54 - have it
08:55 - we can now easily see what values are on
08:57 - the graph so I can see that this down
08:59 - here is between 40 and 50 and it's in
09:01 - the x-axis on the three so the graph is
09:04 - now much easier to read so there it is
09:07 - we have successfully added separators or
09:09 - graft make it easier to read our data in
09:12 - the next video we're going to customize
09:14 - our axes and labels as always you can
09:17 - download the project files in utilities
09:18 - from unity code monkey comm if you have
09:21 - any questions post them in the comments
09:23 - and I'll do my best answer them ok see
09:25 - you next time
