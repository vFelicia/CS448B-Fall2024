00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:01 - and here is the progress that I made in
00:03 - my game adding a really interesting
00:05 - mechanic for interplanetary travel it's
00:07 - been a while since the last devlog the
00:09 - month of July and the beginning of
00:10 - August were a bit tricky balancing a
00:12 - YouTube channel and making a game at the
00:13 - same time has definitely been a lot more
00:14 - difficult than I thought basically I've
00:16 - been experiencing what is probably the
00:18 - reality to most of you most of you
00:19 - probably have a regular day job and you
00:21 - only work on games on the weekends and
00:23 - evenings so that is kind of what I've
00:25 - been doing as I developed this game so
00:26 - this is kind of relatable I guess after
00:28 - a few weeks of focusing mainly on videos
00:30 - lately I've been focusing mainly on the
00:32 - game and I've managed to do quite a bit
00:33 - of progress and managed to get back to
00:35 - this code base pretty easily once again
00:36 - it's thanks to the power of writing good
00:38 - clean code as well as a nice diagram to
00:40 - help me remember how everything was set
00:41 - up because of that coming back to this
00:43 - code base was pretty easy I managed to
00:44 - do quite a lot of work in a short amount
00:46 - of time and I finally managed to
00:48 - implement one of the trickiest Mechanics
00:49 - for this game adding interplanetary
00:51 - travel this was quite tricky to
00:53 - implement especially since the game
00:54 - supports both single player and
00:55 - multiplayer I encounter tons of issues
00:57 - every time I got it working I found
00:59 - something that can only buy broke
01:00 - everything that happened multiple times
01:02 - but by going through it in the end I got
01:04 - it on working hopefully by hearing how I
01:06 - encountered down those issues and
01:07 - managed to fix him hearing that won't be
01:09 - useful to you to remember that when you
01:11 - encounter bugs in your own games that's
01:12 - perfectly normal that's perfectly part
01:14 - of the process even though I do have
01:16 - Decades of experience I still get bugs
01:17 - like anyone else when I write code
01:19 - sometimes it works the first time and
01:21 - sometimes it doesn't that's perfectly
01:22 - normal so if you encounter bugs in your
01:24 - own games and don't get frustrated that
01:26 - doesn't mean that you're bad at
01:27 - programming or game development that's
01:28 - just a perfectly normal part of building
01:30 - any project so when I got back to work
01:32 - on the game I spent some time just
01:34 - working on polishing and after adding
01:35 - some Polish I got to work on adding more
01:37 - serious mechanics and I focus on the one
01:39 - that I knew was going to be quite
01:40 - complex adding interplanetary travel
01:42 - basically I want the player to be able
01:44 - to move between multiple Worlds the
01:45 - whole idea is to repopulate the entire
01:47 - galaxy with dinkies so I need the player
01:49 - to be able to go from one word on to the
01:51 - next one but importantly of course I
01:53 - need to not lose the data on that first
01:54 - world if the player then got back to the
01:56 - first one everything should still be
01:58 - exactly as they left it initially my
01:59 - first thought was pretty simple why
02:01 - don't I just spawn the entire world off
02:03 - to the side somewhere technically that
02:05 - could work I could have two worlds
02:07 - separated but both running at the exact
02:08 - same time but that would become really
02:10 - messy really quickly it would cause all
02:12 - sorts of issues with instance lists and
02:14 - all kinds of UI and visual elements the
02:16 - game really was made to assume that all
02:18 - the objects exist in a single world and
02:20 - of course if I were to take that
02:21 - approach it would just be a matter of
02:22 - time before everything broke due to
02:24 - Performance just imagine having 10
02:26 - worlds of them running with hundreds of
02:28 - objects at the same time all of it being
02:30 - networkally synchronized with all that
02:32 - I'm pretty sure it's only a matter of
02:33 - time before everything breaks so the
02:35 - approach of cloning the worm off to the
02:36 - side that doesn't really work the
02:38 - approach I ended up taking was simply
02:39 - when I leave a world save the Save State
02:42 - for that world then load the Save State
02:44 - for the other one then when I come back
02:45 - I can download the Save State for this
02:47 - one in theory that is one task that
02:49 - sounds relatively straightforward just
02:51 - basic saving and loading but building
02:52 - this was actually quite challenging
02:54 - especially since the game is meant to
02:55 - work in both single player and
02:56 - multiplayer if it was just single player
02:58 - this would have been much much easier to
03:00 - build so here's my advice to you if
03:02 - you're a beginner if you're just signing
03:03 - out definitely start off with single
03:04 - player games don't go into multiplayer
03:06 - until have a decent amount of experience
03:07 - everything is much more difficult in
03:09 - multiplayer anyways before I could even
03:11 - start working on that I first had to
03:13 - rework the safe system basically I need
03:15 - to update the file in order to be able
03:16 - to store not just one Worm but any kind
03:18 - of Worlds and I also need to separate
03:20 - what is World data and global data for
03:22 - example for items and dinkies those
03:24 - exist in a single world so they should
03:26 - be saved in that world but other things
03:28 - like detectory that one is meant to be a
03:30 - Global Unlock you're not meant to lose
03:31 - all of your unlocks when you go from one
03:33 - lay to one B so some data needs to be on
03:36 - a permanent basis and other that needs
03:37 - to be Global I refactor the save file to
03:40 - make sure that everything works
03:41 - correctly but in doing so I also did not
03:43 - want the game to commonly break the
03:44 - saves of anyone who is currently trying
03:46 - out the demo so I also made sure to add
03:48 - some backwards compatibility thankfully
03:50 - this was actually pretty easy I just
03:52 - kept the own structure directly in the
03:53 - code then when trying to load it I'm
03:55 - going to try and load using that type if
03:57 - it works then great it uses that own
03:59 - version but if it doesn't work then
04:00 - loads using the brand new version and
04:02 - since I was changing the format for the
04:04 - save file I wanted to make it future
04:05 - proof I made sure to separate all the
04:07 - data so that I couldn't add more data in
04:09 - various places if I need to this was
04:11 - another task that normally would be
04:13 - quite difficult but thankfully was super
04:14 - easy thanks to the power of experience
04:15 - this is something that I've done several
04:17 - times before for example I covered how
04:20 - to do saving and loading onto a file
04:21 - including some extra data on another
04:23 - video here I did the exact same thing I
04:26 - literally watched my own video to
04:27 - remember how I set that up so I made a
04:29 - file header I stored the number of bytes
04:31 - and so on I separated the found metadata
04:33 - from the actual save data and just for
04:35 - fun I also implemented the logic to be
04:37 - able to store a screenshot adding this
04:39 - feature really is a great example of the
04:41 - power of experience the first time that
04:42 - I implemented something like this it
04:44 - took me dozens of hours trying to figure
04:46 - out how all this works it included a lot
04:48 - of trial and error whereas right now it
04:50 - was surprisingly easy that showcases not
04:52 - just the power of experience but also
04:53 - one of the reasons why I make videos for
04:55 - this Channel all the things that I end
04:57 - up researching for various videos
04:58 - eventually end up being super useful to
05:00 - me in my own projects okay so with that
05:02 - I had the new new file structure and I
05:03 - could finally start working on building
05:05 - multiple Worlds the idea is basically
05:07 - save all the current objects into memory
05:09 - then destroy all those objects destroy
05:11 - the environment then unload a brand new
05:13 - environment and unload the brand new
05:14 - objects for that new world it's
05:16 - important concept but it did have a
05:18 - bunch of really tricky Parts there
05:19 - weren't a lot of times when I thought
05:21 - okay it's finally working then I go to
05:22 - test and suddenly find a brand new bug
05:24 - that breaks everything like I said
05:25 - hopefully this is a great practical
05:27 - example to you as to how finding bugs is
05:29 - a perfectly normal part of the Game Dev
05:30 - process sometimes I read comments from
05:32 - people who are a bit frustrated that
05:34 - they write some code and doesn't come
05:35 - out perfect like you see in my videos
05:36 - but remember in my videos I cut out the
05:39 - mistakes when you see a tutorial I'm not
05:41 - going to cover all the various points
05:42 - that I went where things went wrong I'm
05:44 - just going to cover the things that
05:45 - actually make up the final working
05:46 - product but that absolutely does not
05:48 - mean that I don't find errors during all
05:50 - my research in building any system I get
05:52 - those errors just the same as you the
05:54 - one big difference between myself and a
05:55 - beginner the difference is that I just
05:57 - don't get frustrated when something
05:58 - breaks I simply accept it as perfectly
06:00 - normal and then fix it and thanks to my
06:02 - many years of experience every time I
06:03 - see a bug it's only unlikely that it's
06:05 - something that I've never seen before so
06:07 - most of the times when I see a bug I
06:08 - know exactly how to fix it and even when
06:10 - I don't know how to fix it thanks to all
06:11 - my interest of experience I do have
06:13 - quite a bit of nice debugging skills so
06:15 - I do know what logs I need to make in
06:17 - order to figure out what is the cause of
06:18 - death bug so that's just a nice tip for
06:20 - you when working on your projects when
06:21 - something breaks just relax that is a
06:23 - perfectly normal part just trying to
06:25 - improve your debugging skills so the
06:26 - next time you encounter that bug things
06:28 - will be much easier to fix anyway so yep
06:30 - adding this multi-world mechanic was
06:32 - really tricky I found lots of bugs
06:33 - here's every step that I took and every
06:35 - problem that I found and how I managed
06:36 - to fix it first thing I needed was
06:38 - simply to dynamically spawn the world so
06:40 - rather than having a fixed worm on the
06:42 - game scene inside of that I need to
06:43 - dynamically spawn it depending on what
06:45 - run the player was on now the obvious
06:47 - way to do that is just put the world
06:48 - inside of prefab and just spawn that
06:50 - prefab in single player this option
06:52 - would work perfectly but in multiplayer
06:54 - objects can't really just be
06:56 - instantiated they need to actually be
06:57 - spawned on a network so I thought okay
06:59 - I'm going to make this prefab a network
07:00 - object and just spawn it but but again
07:02 - yet another bug one of the ways due to
07:04 - how netcode for game objects works is
07:06 - you cannot have a child network object
07:08 - as a child of another Network object
07:10 - since each World also has some Resource
07:12 - One areas which are supposed to be
07:14 - Network objects because that I could not
07:16 - make the apparent prefab a network
07:17 - object as well so the next option was
07:19 - okay so don't make the main prefab a
07:21 - network object just spawn it as a
07:23 - Wrangler object then go through on the
07:24 - children and spawn them as Network
07:26 - objects and yep look at that this
07:28 - approach does work everything is
07:29 - spawning correctly but then I went to
07:31 - test with a client and again everything
07:32 - broke it said the client cannot spawn
07:34 - these objects because they are not on
07:36 - the prefamil list this was a really
07:37 - tricky bug that really made me quite
07:39 - confused if I look at the list I can't
07:41 - see yep the object is there and look at
07:43 - that the HQ building is exactly there so
07:45 - why is it that the client does not find
07:46 - it Well in this case turns out that the
07:48 - answer is when you instantiate the
07:49 - prefab in unity when you do that it
07:51 - actually spawns a copy of the prefab so
07:54 - after instantiating the object that is
07:55 - on the hierarchy that one is no longer a
07:57 - direct reference of the original prefab
07:58 - that one is now a copy that looks
08:00 - exactly like the original preferm so
08:02 - that meant and that as I instantiated
08:03 - the copy of the world that copy which
08:06 - contained all of the various Network
08:07 - objects that are trying to spawn of
08:09 - those were actually copies and they were
08:11 - not references of the original prefabs
08:12 - that were on the prefab list so yeah
08:14 - this took me quite a while to figure out
08:15 - like I said making multiplayer games
08:17 - makes everything much more difficult all
08:19 - the errors are much more difficult and
08:21 - importantly the debugging process that
08:23 - is even more confusing I made a simple
08:25 - RPC to be able to send the logs from the
08:27 - server to the client in order to verify
08:28 - were they somehow receiving different
08:30 - objects and because that I managed to
08:32 - see that for some reason the hash codes
08:34 - were different despite the fact that
08:35 - they were supposedly the same objects
08:36 - and that's how I figured out the whole
08:38 - thing about the copying becoming clones
08:39 - of the same prefab so yeah this was
08:41 - really tricky but after finding the
08:43 - cause the solution is super easy I just
08:45 - made a super simple script that holds a
08:46 - reference to the original pre-file then
08:48 - when cycling through the copies instead
08:50 - of spawning them directly I'm just going
08:51 - to instantiate the original prefab and
08:53 - spawn that one so it has changed
08:54 - everything was not working correctly I
08:56 - could now spawn as both a house and a
08:58 - client and everything would work
08:59 - perfectly however when I try to move to
09:02 - a different World once again tons of
09:03 - issues the main one is actually a priest
09:06 - range run when moving between scenes the
09:08 - objects were for some reason not being
09:09 - destroyed I thought this was strange but
09:11 - it was an easy fix just manually destroy
09:13 - all the objects in the list but only
09:15 - later the end I realized what was
09:16 - actually going on in the background the
09:18 - issue is because the network object
09:20 - spawn function that one for some reason
09:21 - default to false on destroyon load I
09:24 - have no idea why false is the default
09:26 - here this is the completely opposite for
09:28 - every default on every other game object
09:30 - any other game object by default if you
09:32 - don't tell it to survive between loads
09:34 - it won't get destroyed but for some
09:35 - reason our Network objects the default
09:37 - Behavior was worse so by default Network
09:39 - objects will persist between scene
09:41 - changes so that was the issue here but
09:42 - again after figuring out the solution is
09:44 - super simple just set it to phone so
09:46 - make sure that it destroys on load and
09:47 - everything works so once again I got
09:49 - everything working no errors the players
09:51 - could now change worlds okay great but
09:53 - once again another sneaky issue popped
09:55 - up that once again broke everything this
09:57 - time the issue was on the save system if
09:59 - I started in one world then change to
10:01 - the other one then made save and loaded
10:03 - that save if I did that everything
10:04 - worked but if I started on one world
10:07 - then I did not go to the other one and I
10:09 - just saved right there and download that
10:10 - save file at that point when I load the
10:12 - game and moved on to the second world
10:14 - now everything would break this was
10:16 - another really tricky issue that again
10:17 - took tons of time tons of vlogging to
10:19 - figure out what was the cause it turns
10:21 - out the issue has to do with Json now
10:23 - Json is really awesome it is excellent
10:25 - for making save files super easily but
10:28 - since it is text based it has some weird
10:29 - quirks with how it regards nulls or
10:32 - empty objects the issue ended up being
10:34 - that if I first move to another world
10:35 - then it would basically generate the
10:37 - data for both those worlds but if I
10:39 - never made that change when I saved just
10:41 - on the first world when I did that
10:42 - basically it would save the second world
10:45 - as a known object now in my case I
10:47 - assumed that was going to happen so I
10:48 - made a simple null check but it turns
10:50 - out that Json automatically serialized
10:51 - the object so it does not actually save
10:53 - it as no so it was actually saving for
10:55 - basically a initialized object on all on
10:57 - zero so for example on the HQ it saved
11:00 - the position on zero zero zero it has
11:02 - the the phone type and so on so
11:03 - basically the object was not known but
11:05 - then for the actual HQ object data that
11:07 - data was commonly empty so when I went
11:09 - to load obviously everything breaks
11:11 - simulation here was basically just
11:13 - sending a check not just checking if the
11:14 - object is null itself but check the
11:16 - contents and make sure they are not the
11:18 - complete defaults so yet another issue
11:20 - that was really tricky to find but I did
11:21 - manage to find an infection after all
11:23 - those errors and bugs finally everything
11:25 - was working I could create a game in
11:27 - either a single player or multiplayer I
11:29 - could jump to any worm that I want and
11:31 - the word on that is perfectly saved so
11:32 - if I go from one lay to one B then come
11:34 - back everything is exactly as I left it
11:36 - and if the host travels and all the
11:38 - clients load along with them so this is
11:40 - definitely tricky as you can see in lots
11:42 - of bugs but in the end I finally got it
11:43 - working then it was just a matter of
11:44 - making it work in game instead of using
11:46 - a debug key again this was pretty easy
11:48 - the rocket already exists in the world
11:50 - it already has the building stages and
11:51 - all that so I just made a new window in
11:53 - order to select destination of where I
11:55 - want to travel to then I made some
11:56 - slightly different environments for
11:58 - different worlds pretty much just change
11:59 - the color just to make them visually
12:00 - different obviously I still have have to
12:02 - build out these actual worlds then I
12:04 - also added some logic in order to be
12:05 - able to carry the quick container
12:07 - contents be able to carry those as
12:09 - Rocket travels to another planet this is
12:11 - going to be super important because not
12:12 - every world has every resource so in the
12:14 - final game you're going to need to
12:15 - coordinate the logistics between
12:16 - different planets in order to make sure
12:18 - you have all resources in all planets so
12:20 - with that this mechanic is working
12:21 - however some of you might be noticed
12:23 - there's actually two very glaring flaws
12:25 - number one is how exactly do you
12:27 - automate moving resources from plant a
12:29 - to Planet B if the player is the one
12:31 - that has to manually initiate the rocket
12:33 - movement and that leads to problem
12:34 - number two which is what happens to the
12:36 - planets when you're not on there right
12:38 - now they are just static so once you get
12:40 - back it just loads the save exactly as
12:41 - it was before so it's as if time was
12:43 - frozen whereas you would think okay
12:45 - shouldn't time really continue moving on
12:47 - as you're in another planet and the
12:49 - answer is of course it should so that is
12:51 - something that I absolutely need to
12:52 - implement that is the next really
12:54 - complex task that I need to work on and
12:56 - right now I honestly have no idea how
12:58 - I'm going to implement that the code
12:59 - really wasn't set up to be able to have
13:01 - dummy objects and real objects so I'll
13:03 - have to figure out okay how can I
13:05 - generalize the logic so I don't have to
13:06 - do a bunch of copy pasting maybe I can
13:08 - just spawn the objects in a separate
13:10 - world that does not impact the first
13:11 - world so I don't know that it's
13:13 - definitely going to be really complex
13:14 - but it has to be done that is a crucial
13:16 - mechanic for the game obviously the
13:18 - machines do need to continue working in
13:19 - order to transfer resources between the
13:21 - worlds so yeah there's definitely going
13:22 - to be a very tricky task but once again
13:24 - I'm confident that whatever errors I
13:25 - find I'll be able to fix them and in the
13:27 - end I'll be able to get that mechanic
13:28 - working if you want to try out the game
13:30 - with this update go ahead and check out
13:31 - the free demo as well as add the game to
13:33 - your wish list alright thank you for
13:34 - watching and I'll see you next time
