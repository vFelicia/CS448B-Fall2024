00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code
00:01 - monkeying okay so a few days ago I made
00:04 - a really interesting video on seeing if
00:06 - I can make an open world game using a
00:08 - bunch of really useful tools then in the
00:10 - comments someone asked could you take
00:11 - this game and convert it into
00:12 - multiplayer in a few weeks I was pretty
00:15 - confident that this could be done in a
00:16 - few hours not a few weeks once again
00:18 - thanks to using some really awesome very
00:20 - helpful tools I'm actually currently
00:22 - working on my own steam game dinky
00:23 - Guardians and it is using network frame
00:25 - objects which is unity's multiplayer
00:27 - Solutions so I'm quite familiar with it
00:28 - by the way go ahead and add the game to
00:30 - your wishlist so I figured rather than
00:32 - just entering that comment I would
00:33 - actually try to do it and see if it
00:35 - really is as easy as I thought here's
00:37 - how that went and by the way the tools
00:39 - that I use in making that open world
00:40 - game those are only on sale for two more
00:42 - days so if you need anything get it
00:43 - quickly so I open up the project and
00:45 - started off by installing the Neko for
00:47 - game objects package then based on how
00:49 - the tune works I installed the simple
00:51 - network manager then I added a client
00:53 - Network transform on the player in order
00:55 - to synchronize the movement I also set
00:57 - up a network animator on the player
00:59 - visual in order to synchronize the
01:00 - animations then I set up the player
01:02 - prefab to spawn it automatically I added
01:04 - to the player script in order to ignore
01:06 - any logic not from the owner also added
01:08 - the same logic to disable the camera on
01:09 - objects that were not the owner I added
01:12 - some basic testing netcode buttons to
01:13 - start host and start client then I made
01:15 - the build and look at that in just a few
01:18 - minutes I got multiplayer working
01:19 - perfectly awesome the players don't look
01:21 - quite a bit silly with just their arms
01:23 - that's why in first person multiplayer
01:25 - games usually you have to have both a
01:27 - first person perspective as well as a
01:29 - third person visual animation but for
01:31 - this quick prototype making it look
01:33 - quite silly it's actually a plus just
01:34 - like the other video this once again
01:36 - shows the power of using awesome tools
01:38 - making multiplayer games used to be
01:40 - insanely difficult personally I really
01:41 - remember trying to add multiplayer to my
01:43 - very first scene Game Survivor Squad
01:44 - adding that was really difficult I
01:46 - remember suffering quite a lot trying to
01:48 - get that working whereas right now in
01:50 - literally just a few minutes I get the
01:51 - basics fully working but at the same
01:53 - time that is really just the absolute
01:54 - Basics only the basic movement is being
01:56 - synchronized so basically we still need
01:58 - to synchronize all the other data sorry
01:59 - off with one of the important mechanics
02:01 - that I made for that game which was the
02:03 - spawning of the plane in the single
02:04 - player version I made the plane and the
02:06 - player as separate game objects but in
02:09 - multiplayer spawning two player objects
02:10 - that is a little bit tricky it can be
02:12 - done but it is a bit tricky to manage so
02:14 - in order to simplify I just included the
02:16 - plane directly inside of the player
02:18 - prefab that way I only need to enable or
02:20 - disabled game objects there's no need to
02:21 - spawn anything else for thinking the
02:23 - movement is the same thing as the player
02:25 - on foot just add a client Network
02:26 - transform and everything already Works
02:28 - once again I made it to only run the
02:30 - logic on the owner I added some logic to
02:32 - synchronize the spawning and the
02:33 - despawning of the various visuals and
02:35 - with a quick test yep there's the plane
02:37 - already working perfectly one player can
02:39 - spawn a plane and the rest one can see
02:41 - it perfectly okay so far so good by the
02:44 - way here you can see a fun thing of how
02:45 - Game Dev is really all about smoke and
02:47 - mirrors look how the plane seems to be
02:49 - insanely fast from the point of view of
02:51 - the pilot but from the point of view of
02:52 - the player sitting on the floor for that
02:54 - one it doesn't really seem like the
02:55 - plane is actually moving that fast the
02:57 - super simple trick to make something
02:58 - look really fast is just to use a really
03:00 - wide fov just that one change alone
03:02 - really gives it a really nice sense of
03:04 - speed so that's just a simple tip if
03:06 - you're making some speed based games
03:07 - it's the exact same trick that I use in
03:09 - my own drag racing minigame anyway so
03:11 - with that the plane is synchronized
03:13 - perfectly another thing we need to sync
03:15 - are the projectiles again this is really
03:17 - simple and the projectiles are really
03:18 - just prefabs so all it takes is really
03:20 - just making a server RPC in order to
03:22 - spawn them since again only server can
03:24 - spawn objects then I modified the prefab
03:26 - to once again add a simple Network
03:28 - transform component I also synchronize
03:30 - the hit particles once again the same
03:31 - thing just a server RPC in order to
03:33 - spawn them on the server and with that
03:35 - yep everything already works so all the
03:37 - players can fire projectiles all of the
03:38 - other ones can see it and all of the
03:40 - particles everything works perfectly it
03:41 - generally is really impressive just how
03:43 - simple it is to synchronize things in
03:44 - multiplayer nowadays you just had a few
03:47 - components right on a little bit of code
03:48 - and everything already works perfectly
03:49 - so the next task was synchronizing the
03:52 - enemies these are once again pretty
03:54 - simple it just requires adding a network
03:55 - transform to synchronize the transform a
03:58 - network animator for the animations I
04:00 - edited the enemy script in order to make
04:02 - it only run the logic on the host and
04:04 - once again just without everything
04:05 - already works I can log from the client
04:07 - look at the host and there it is the
04:08 - host walking around attacking and being
04:10 - attacked by the enemy then for
04:12 - synchronizing the castle heart since he
04:14 - projectiles are already only running on
04:15 - the server everything is already
04:17 - perfectly synchronized the heart is
04:18 - already taking damage from any player
04:20 - anywhere in the world surreal level
04:22 - takes is just a server and client RPC in
04:24 - order to trigger when the castle dies
04:26 - just doing that in order to trigger the
04:27 - animation on all the coins and yep there
04:29 - it is everything works alright so here
04:31 - I've got the game and I've got four
04:32 - players connected and yep as you can see
04:34 - everything works so I've got all the
04:36 - players so all of them are synchronized
04:38 - all of them are seeing the projections
04:39 - being fired I can shoot with this one
04:41 - and yep they all see those projectiles
04:43 - now I can try spawning a plane and jump
04:46 - into it and there you go I'm on the
04:48 - plane and yep the other players are also
04:49 - seeing my plane so wish going right
04:51 - through there yep everything is perfect
04:53 - now I have to say it is quite difficult
04:56 - to control four players at once but yep
04:58 - everything isn't it working
05:00 - finally just attacked the castle heart
05:02 - and if there go all of them play the
05:04 - animation and the castle heart is
05:05 - destroyed on all of them so yep there it
05:07 - is everything works everything's
05:08 - synchronized once again the answer to
05:10 - the question of the title is exactly the
05:11 - same one as it was in the previous video
05:13 - using all of the awesome tools that
05:15 - exists nowadays yep it is indeed
05:16 - possible for a solo in developer to make
05:18 - both a open world game and make it
05:20 - multiplayer I think in the end this took
05:22 - me maybe four to five hours so
05:23 - definitely not weeks and most of the
05:25 - time was actually not necessarily spent
05:26 - on the multiplayer just based on
05:28 - re-architecting the single player since
05:30 - when I made the single player version I
05:31 - made some assumptions that only existed
05:33 - one player so I used a bunch of
05:35 - Singletons and a bunch of things that
05:36 - always assumed only one player exists so
05:38 - I had to refactor a bunch of code
05:39 - regarding that in terms of adding the
05:41 - multiplier itself that part was really
05:43 - super quick although Again part of the
05:45 - reason why it was super fast is because
05:46 - I'm extremely familiar with the stone
05:47 - set it's what I'm using for my upcoming
05:49 - Sim game so I'm used to working with
05:51 - this tool set every single day if you
05:53 - want to learn how to make multiple games
05:54 - check out my free complete course it's a
05:57 - 7 hour course which covers how to use
05:58 - this tool net code for game objects and
06:00 - goes through the making of an entire
06:02 - game in quite a lot of detail learn how
06:04 - to use Network variables custom Network
06:05 - behaviors how to send and receive server
06:08 - and client rpcs how to synchronize
06:10 - custom data and so on I'm really pleased
06:12 - with how the course came out it won't
06:13 - really teach you how to make multiplayer
06:14 - games and also the assets that I use to
06:16 - make my open world game those are still
06:18 - on sale for just two more days and same
06:20 - thing on the Senti store if you need
06:22 - some low poly assets this sale is also
06:24 - ending on Wednesday so if you need
