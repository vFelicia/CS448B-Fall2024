00:07 - out every month so in this video let's
00:08 - check out some highlights for April 23
00:10 - in this first video I'll be covering a
00:11 - list of free assets and next ones I'll
00:13 - be covering paid ads and tools let me
00:14 - know in the comments if you pick up any

00:17 - them also right now there's a humble
00:18 - button with a bunch of Game Dev TV
00:20 - courses on making RPG elements I
00:22 - remember going through the inventory
00:23 - course and I quite liked it so these
00:26 - four are made using some really nice
00:27 - clean code you can get the entire pack
00:29 - for just 25 bucks and there's also a
00:31 - mega bundle on the NT accessor so this
00:34 - one as usual has multiple tiers up to 95
00:36 - off you've got a the sound Shader a
00:38 - bunch of icons then over here and I see
00:40 - on the editor console Pro so a much more
00:42 - advanced console if you've got the game
00:43 - creator which quite a lot of people like
00:45 - this one we've got some vegetation some
00:47 - first person animations you've got some
00:49 - sounds some robots or maybe a kid to
00:51 - make your own stardew Valley so check
00:53 - out both bundles with the links in the
00:55 - description alright so on to the top 10
00:57 - list starting off with the free enemies
00:59 - demo now you probably already know what
01:01 - this one is it's unity's latest visual
01:03 - showcase and looks really gorgeous and
01:05 - now you can get the demo and play with
01:06 - it yourself obviously note how this is
01:08 - an egrp demo meant to push the visuals
01:11 - to the absolute Max so definitely don't
01:12 - expect it to run well unless you have an
01:14 - excellent machine this uses tons of
01:16 - features that they made for this demo
01:17 - and then added them to egrp so there's
01:19 - adaptive probe volumes screen space
01:21 - Global illumination real-time Ray Trace
01:24 - reflection Ray trace and inclusion the
01:26 - LSS support and a bunch more this also
01:28 - includes the really high-end skin and
01:30 - eye shaders so if you want to push Unity
01:32 - visuals to their limits then definitely
01:34 - check out how this one is made next
01:35 - here's a cone character it's a nice
01:37 - mimic lots of tentacles swirling around
01:39 - and touching the floor and looks really
01:41 - nice just a while ago I was re-watching
01:43 - the awesome movie Edge of Tomorrow and
01:45 - this character certainly would be
01:46 - perfect for a game inspired by that
01:48 - movie looking at this also makes me just
01:50 - want to build a character like this just
01:51 - for fun play around with some shaders
01:53 - and maybe some animation rating then for
01:55 - a really nice Zoom here is extra star
01:57 - assets this one is basically an add-on
01:59 - for Unity certain assets which seems to
02:01 - add quite a lot of stuff especially for
02:03 - a free package it features a nice
02:05 - character creator script where you can
02:06 - choose what abilities you want your
02:08 - character to have you can add movement
02:09 - jump pushing or Sprint do you seen like
02:11 - the camera type maybe add a gun or
02:13 - flashlight and you have a working
02:14 - controller this is definitely a great
02:16 - addition to the already great star
02:18 - assets next if you have a Discord
02:20 - community and you want to make some
02:21 - posts from Unity then here is a nice
02:23 - tool I'm not familiar with the Discord
02:25 - API but apparently through web hooks you
02:27 - can make posts you can create threads
02:29 - and it will include attachments and
02:30 - embeds so I could see this as being very
02:32 - useful if you want to create some kind
02:34 - of control panel from Unity where you
02:36 - can manage your Discord or perhaps edit
02:38 - your game and post a message when a
02:39 - player starts playing the game for some
02:41 - visuals here is another free pack
02:42 - directly from Unity this one is urp and
02:45 - it's for their Adventure game
02:46 - environment pack this one was used in a
02:48 - bunch of tutorials as well as in the
02:50 - adventure sample game project you can
02:52 - follow that project or in unity and
02:53 - learn or you can just use this package
02:55 - as a nice environment in your game next
02:57 - up here is another interesting one it's
02:59 - an aircraft generator it uses modular
03:01 - pieces to create tons of random
03:02 - variation all of them look really great
03:04 - they really don't look like they're
03:06 - generated at all you have some fighter
03:08 - jets some with some reverse Wings a
03:09 - bunch of bumpers and some that look like
03:11 - upper planes then if you're making a 2d
03:13 - game and you need some nice cute slimes
03:15 - here's a great pack they're all in a
03:17 - very cute cartoony art style it includes
03:19 - quite a lot of variation with a whole
03:20 - bunch of different Sprites next up for
03:22 - some steampunk UI here's a nice one
03:24 - definitely looks very chunky very
03:26 - steampunk you have several backgrounds
03:28 - including all kinds of Sliders and
03:29 - buttons it even has some cursors which
03:32 - perhaps you could combine with my own
03:33 - mouse cursor system Pro then if you need
03:35 - some vegetation check out this one it's
03:37 - a low poly style all of it looks very
03:39 - inviting it includes almost 50 models so
03:41 - that's some environment grass stone
03:43 - Hills and a bunch of buildings if you're
03:45 - working on a tower defense game here's a
03:47 - nice turn it's very saffron looking it
03:49 - includes three separate modular Parts
03:51 - anything like this style then you can
