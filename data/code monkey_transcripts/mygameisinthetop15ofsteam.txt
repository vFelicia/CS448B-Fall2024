00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey in
00:02 - a previous video I showed sales of my
00:04 - recent game just one week after release
00:06 - basically it had made $13,000 in gross
00:09 - revenue and sold about 1,000 copies now
00:11 - for some of you depending on how long
00:12 - you've been learning about Steam and IND
00:14 - games in general if you just started out
00:16 - and looking at this might seem like a
00:17 - really low result especially if you're
00:19 - someone from the US and you're used to
00:21 - people talking about their tax salaries
00:22 - in the high six figures if so then
00:25 - compared to that Yep this amount does
00:26 - seem extremely low it might seem like
00:28 - this game is a flop however looking at
00:30 - the actual numbers at the actual
00:31 - statistics the game is actually doing
00:33 - quite well now based on first week sales
00:35 - we can actually do a guesstimate and
00:36 - figure out how much the game might sell
00:38 - in the first year that ratio is usually
00:40 - anywhere between 2 and six now for me
00:42 - I'm planning to continue working on the
00:44 - game and continuing to talk about it
00:45 - make various tutorials about it so in my
00:47 - case I can probably guesstimate that the
00:49 - ratio for this game will probably be
00:50 - around the five Mark so that means I can
00:52 - probably expect it to sell about 50,000
00:54 - in gross revenue in the first year and
00:56 - according to the graph over here on VG
00:57 - insights by the way this is an excellent
00:59 - website if you want to see all kinds of
01:01 - stats Rel to seam in any games so over
01:03 - here we can see the revenue distribution
01:05 - and if the game does hit 50k on the
01:07 - first year then that would put it up
01:09 - here which is right on the top 15% of
01:11 - Steam games so over here you can see
01:13 - just how tough this business is you can
01:14 - see how most games don't even make 5K
01:17 - steam is constantly hitting new records
01:19 - it is absolutely massive and with all
01:21 - these users it makes a massive amount of
01:23 - money literally billions of dollars
01:24 - every single year but in terms of
01:26 - developers it's all heavily skewed
01:27 - towards the top basically most of the
01:29 - money get go to just this top 3% which
01:32 - in reality that still actually means
01:33 - quite a lot of games are finding success
01:35 - we can see the number of releases every
01:37 - single month there are tons and tons of
01:38 - games coming out every single month for
01:40 - example in September there were 1,200
01:42 - games released that is a huge amount I
01:44 - believe in total that are over 50,000
01:46 - Steam games so going back to the 3% 3%
01:48 - to 50,000 is actually still quite a bit
01:51 - that's still about 2,000 games making
01:52 - millions of dollars so that is still
01:54 - pretty good but at the same time there
01:55 - are still about 40,000 out of those
01:57 - 50,000 games that don't even make 5K now
02:00 - my goal with this video is not to make
02:01 - you depressed or discourage you from
02:03 - following your Game Dev dreams I really
02:04 - just want to be transparent and make
02:06 - sure you have enough data points if you
02:08 - want to decide that you would like to
02:09 - make this as a full-time living just be
02:11 - aware that the reality is this is a
02:13 - really tough business in this channel my
02:15 - goal is really to teach you game
02:16 - development so you can make the games
02:18 - that you dream of however there's a
02:20 - really big difference between making
02:21 - games for fun as a hobby and trying to
02:23 - make a living out of it as a hobby I
02:25 - really believe that anyone can learn how
02:26 - to make games personally I'm a huge
02:28 - believer in educations so I believe that
02:30 - if you make the effort you can learn to
02:32 - build pretty much any game you can
02:33 - imagine for myself I can say that I've
02:35 - already reached a really nice point
02:37 - where I can pretty much build any game
02:38 - idea that I can think of so making games
02:40 - is a lot of fun and I definitely
02:41 - encourage people to follow that passion
02:43 - if that is something that they desire
02:45 - but when it comes to making a living out
02:46 - of your games the reality is that
02:48 - achieving that is going to be extremely
02:50 - difficult I still believe you can learn
02:51 - how to do it especially if you study a
02:54 - lot on Steam game marketing but at the
02:56 - same time it requires so many things to
02:58 - go right that I definitely would not
02:59 - encourage you to pry much just quit your
03:01 - day job and gble everything on the hope
03:03 - that your game will find success like I
03:05 - said I'm confident that based on my own
03:06 - technical skills I can pretty much build
03:08 - any game idea that I can think of but I
03:10 - cannot really guarantee that that game
03:12 - idea will find financial success
03:14 - although as you look at this graph as to
03:15 - how much money each game makes looking
03:17 - at this whether making a living sounds
03:20 - impossible or just somewhat difficult
03:21 - that is really up to you what I mean by
03:23 - that is how it's very much dependent on
03:25 - how much money you actually spend I
03:26 - believe that is really the main thing
03:28 - that defines just how easy or hard it is
03:30 - to actually make a living from your
03:31 - games this is also something that I've
03:33 - talked about quite a bit in the past I
03:35 - made a really nice video talking about
03:36 - my story and how to survive as a Game
03:38 - Dev for over a decade when it comes to
03:41 - making games cheaply I believe that is
03:42 - sort of my unintentional superpower I
03:44 - live in a lowc cost of living country
03:46 - and when I started making a living from
03:47 - my games I was making sure to spend as
03:49 - little as possible and over here I can
03:51 - actually survive on just about 750 bucks
03:53 - a month so even though this chart
03:55 - doesn't look pretty bad it looks pretty
03:56 - depressing even with that if I'm capable
03:58 - of making a game in just 6 months and my
04:00 - costs are just 700 bucks a month then in
04:02 - theory I can still make a living on this
04:04 - bottom part which such in low monthly
04:06 - cost and if I do everything myself then
04:08 - I can pretty much turn a profit with
04:09 - under 5K however on the other hand if I
04:12 - was living somewhere like San Francisco
04:13 - and I needed 5K a month just barely
04:15 - scrip by if so then even if I made a
04:17 - game super quickly in just 6 months that
04:19 - would still require at least 30 grand
04:21 - just to make a tiny profit so in general
04:23 - I highly encourage you to make games for
04:25 - fun making games Building Systems
04:27 - building game design with all kinds of
04:28 - rules that you define yourself that is
04:30 - really fun personally I really enjoy it
04:32 - but my advice is also be very aware that
04:34 - in terms of business this is an
04:35 - extremely tough business so just be
04:37 - aware of all of these numbers and how
04:39 - difficult it is before you make the leap
04:40 - and try to make it your day-to-day
04:42 - living anyway so this was a bit of a
04:44 - random video just because I had the
04:46 - sudden thought to think of where does my
04:47 - game stck up in the entirety of steam
04:49 - it's obviously not a mega hit like the
04:51 - recently released and very excellent
04:53 - Throne fall this is a top 10% any game
04:56 - but based on my own goals my game is
04:58 - actually doing quite well so if you like
05:00 - automation Colony building and defense
05:01 - games then go ahead and check out think
05:03 - Guardians on seam and I really hope you
05:04 - like it thanks for watching and I'll see
05:06 - you next time
