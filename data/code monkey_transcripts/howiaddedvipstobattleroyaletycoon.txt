00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - in this video I'm going to go over my
00:03 - process for designing and implementing
00:05 - VIPs into battleground tycoon let's
00:08 - begin
00:11 - so in this video I will cover my process
00:13 - for the latest update to burn erotic
00:15 - Union which have VIPs
00:16 - they are unique yes which must be kept
00:19 - happy to increase your Park rating the
00:21 - game is up now on Steam so check it out
00:23 - to see what I'm teaching here apply to a
00:24 - real game so as always I start off by
00:27 - writing a rough outline of what I want
00:28 - to accomplish in a simple piece of paper
00:31 - for me I don't usually go too far in
00:33 - depth with my designs just focus on a
00:35 - high level picture and start prototype
00:37 - the VIP isn't in to be a very important
00:41 - guest someone that can give your park a
00:43 - huge boost or a huge penalty I wanted
00:46 - them to have a very unique sprite making
00:48 - them easily stand out
00:49 - I also sketched out the various UI
00:52 - elements that I wanted to create so I
00:55 - wanted a window that shows the current
00:57 - state of the VIP it should show a camera
01:00 - view as well as the name and a bar of
01:02 - the current happiness level and I wanted
01:04 - another window that showed up when the
01:06 - VIP and left the park containing a
01:08 - summary of what the guests thought and
01:10 - what bonuses the player got for his
01:12 - final happiness level so the first thing
01:16 - was to make a VIP spawn as a special
01:18 - guest with a special sprite I created a
01:21 - simple class to handle a VIP and the
01:24 - guest stores that VIP class instance so
01:27 - any special behavior I want I can just
01:29 - test if the guest is a VIP or not and
01:32 - just like that I had a guest behaving
01:35 - like all the others but with a unique
01:36 - name and sprite the VIP is identified by
01:40 - a enum value which defines all of the
01:43 - possible VIPs and based on that it
01:46 - selects the correct name and sprite then
01:49 - I got to work on the UI elements first
01:52 - creating the window that shows a view of
01:54 - where he is and what he is doing this
01:57 - works very much like a normal guest
01:58 - window it's just a camera that is
02:01 - constantly following him I've done a
02:03 - video on a character portrait window so
02:05 - check that out to see how it works
02:08 - the bar is set up like any other bar it
02:11 - just shows his current happiness level
02:13 - so with some sprites and moving things
02:15 - around the VIP window was working
02:17 - correctly then it was time to work on
02:21 - the exit window this window shows up
02:23 - when the VIP Li used in park on the left
02:25 - side you see a camera that has the VIP
02:27 - doing a special animation then you can
02:30 - see his name and his final happiness
02:32 - based on the happiness he left with I
02:35 - created certain tears for a special
02:37 - money reward so if his happiness is
02:40 - under 30 there's no reward if about 50
02:43 - the player gets $500 and so on also on
02:46 - the window you can view every single one
02:48 - of his thoughts and the game thoughts
02:50 - are extremely valuable since they show
02:52 - you exactly what your guests are angry
02:54 - about and what you need to fix so having
02:57 - all the thoughts in the exit window is
02:59 - very nice to make sure you do better for
03:01 - the next one in my original design I
03:04 - also wanted some way of notifying the
03:07 - player that a VIP was coming soon I
03:09 - thought about putting a text pop-up in
03:12 - the middle of the screen but that would
03:14 - simply clutter the game so I use the
03:16 - side messages which is a really useful
03:18 - helmet for displaying certain messages I
03:21 - simply have the message saying the VIP
03:24 - is coming next month and another one
03:26 - when the VIP has entered the park
03:30 - another thing in my design was the heavy
03:33 - intro animation so based on my original
03:36 - design first I made it on the VIP window
03:38 - it would show the animation and then
03:40 - come back to the normal view however
03:42 - that what isn't being as visible as I
03:44 - would like so I separated that and made
03:47 - it into another window and put it for a
03:49 - dead center it's larger and it just
03:52 - shows the VIP and his name so that's one
03:55 - example of how I iterated upon my
03:57 - original design right now they all play
04:00 - the same simple animation but in future
04:02 - updates I will add specific animations
04:04 - for each specific VIP type
04:07 - then to make the VIP more visible I also
04:10 - created a nice thought papa
04:12 - it shows a icon for whether the thought
04:15 - is positive neutral or negative and the
04:18 - thought text the public shows up every
04:21 - once in a while and stays visible for a
04:23 - few seconds so even without opening the
04:26 - VIP window you can still see some of its
04:28 - thoughts at a glance using that pop-up I
04:32 - wrote a few messages specific to each
04:33 - VIP there's an entry message another one
04:36 - when their energy is half empty and
04:38 - another one when they leave these
04:42 - special messages are visible for longer
04:44 - and add a bit more variety to the game
04:46 - by making each VIP very unique lastly I
04:49 - created a VIP specific happiness bar
04:52 - that is used to calculate the park rate
04:54 - the VIP rating increases or decreases
04:57 - based on the exit happiness of each VIP
04:59 - it's pretty simple if they only give
05:02 - much happier than the current rating
05:03 - then drain goes up and if not it goes
05:05 - down the final park rating is calculated
05:08 - from all the various ratings so with all
05:11 - of those elements the VIP system was
05:13 - pretty much done the only thing left to
05:16 - do was make a bunch of unique VIPs the
05:19 - animation system that I'm currently
05:21 - using is the same one that I've used for
05:23 - several games now so that means I have a
05:25 - bunch of cool units that I can use from
05:27 - previous games for example I grabbed a
05:30 - bunch of units from hyper nice battles
05:32 - like the Spartan Persian and zombie from
05:35 - hyper Knights I grabbed a cool-looking
05:37 - Knight from Ninja Tycoon I grabbed ninja
05:41 - and peasant and a bunch of other
05:43 - interesting characters that were used as
05:45 - workshop items for Hyper Knights like
05:47 - the Archangel and the Shadow King also
05:51 - some tf2 characters like the medic
05:53 - soldier and demo man which again were
05:55 - used as workshop items finally some
05:59 - sprites that I created specifically for
06:00 - videos on this channel like the sheriff
06:03 - and bandit which were made for the video
06:05 - creating the Deadeye system from reddit
06:07 - redemption to each VIP has their own
06:10 - sprites named
06:11 - special messages in feature updates I
06:14 - will add more characters from survivor
06:16 - squad and torrent acuity so this is yet
06:19 - another example of how powerful it is to
06:21 - reuse code and use the same systems
06:23 - every time if I had made a completely
06:25 - new animation system then all this would
06:27 - have to be created from scratch so that
06:31 - was it for creating the VIP system for
06:33 - valor on tycoon as you can see my
06:35 - process is relatively simple it starts
06:38 - off with a piece of paper containing the
06:40 - core ideas I want to implement and then
06:42 - I start prototyping and iterating upon
06:44 - it
06:44 - I believe this system is a great
06:47 - addition to the game since it helps keep
06:48 - the experience fresh when the player
06:50 - starts getting bored of seeing the same
06:52 - guest over and over a VIP will
06:54 - eventually pop up with a unique sprite
06:56 - and a special message the game is out
06:59 - now on steam so check it out to see what
07:00 - I'm teaching here apply to a real game
07:02 - if you have any questions post them in
07:04 - the comments and I'll do my best answer
07:06 - them subscribe for more videos and I'll
07:07 - see you next time
07:20 - you
