00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're going to create
00:03 - a time text system let's get started
00:08 - all right so a time Tech system is an
00:11 - easy way to run game logic periodically
00:13 - but less often than on update for
00:15 - example let's say you are making an RTS
00:17 - where buildings say time to construct or
00:19 - they generate resources after some time
00:21 - you could do all the time where
00:23 - calculations in each specific object
00:25 - which would be somewhat wasteful or just
00:28 - subscribe to a on take event and store
00:30 - the number of ticks that way you only
00:32 - have the update time or logic on one
00:34 - object which helps performance so in
00:37 - here I have my empty scene and in my
00:39 - code I have a simple building object
00:42 - class in here in the constructor it
00:44 - takes a position it creates a game
00:47 - object as a sprite renderer gives it a
00:50 - basic sprite and it spawns a
00:53 - construction bar that we're going to use
00:55 - to display the construction stats the
00:57 - world bar is part of the code monkey
00:59 - utilities that you can grab from unity
01:01 - code monkey comm and in my game handler
01:04 - I am simply spawning a building on 0 so
01:06 - let's see how it looks ok there you go
01:08 - you see a basic tower sprite and a
01:11 - construction bar all right so now on our
01:14 - game handler let's make a building on
01:17 - mouse click so let's come this out and
01:19 - here do a private voice update and if
01:23 - input I get mouse button down mouse
01:26 - button 0 so on left mouse click let's
01:29 - make a new building on the mouse
01:33 - position in order to do that I'm going
01:35 - to go into the UTS class which is part
01:37 - of the code monkey utilities and get the
01:40 - mouse world position all right so let's
01:43 - see if we are spawning buildings on
01:45 - mouse click ok there it is one building
01:47 - now that another and so on ok I can now
01:49 - spawn buildings good so now let's make
01:51 - our time.take system go into the scripts
01:53 - and make a new C sharp script name it
01:56 - time tick system so in here let's write
01:59 - our code first of all we're going to
02:01 - need a private end for our current tick
02:04 - we're also going to need to store the
02:06 - time during this tick so a private float
02:08 - take timer and let's also make a timer
02:12 - max which will be a private cons well
02:16 - tick timer
02:18 - Max and let's put it at point
02:21 - point two F equals 200 milliseconds
02:23 - which would mean five ticks per second
02:25 - we're making it Const since we want this
02:27 - to be a constant and never change so on
02:29 - our private void awake let's set the
02:32 - tick to zero and no one private boy
02:36 - update let's increase the tick timer by
02:39 - time.deltatime if the tick timer is
02:44 - bigger than tick timer max then we're
02:47 - going to reduce it by tick timer max
02:50 - increase the tick and just for testing
02:53 - let's go up here do using code monkey so
02:56 - we can go down here and do CMD bug text
03:01 - pop up which will pop up a text object
03:04 - on the mouse position and let's say tick
03:07 - and display the current tick all right
03:11 - so we are increasing the TEC timer by
03:13 - the delta time which is the amount of
03:14 - time that has passed in this frame once
03:17 - it goes over take time or max so every
03:19 - 200 milliseconds we reset the TEC timer
03:22 - we increase the tick and we make it pop
03:24 - up just to see what the value it is ok
03:27 - so now we can go back into our scene and
03:29 - make a new game object and let's name it
03:32 - time tick system and let's drag the
03:36 - script on to it all right so let's test
03:38 - and we should see the pop ups yep there
03:40 - it is you can see the pop ups we're
03:43 - getting a tick every 200 milliseconds so
03:45 - 5 ticks per second ok great now let's
03:48 - make an event that won't trigger every
03:50 - time they take increases go into our
03:53 - code and we're going to make a public
03:55 - static so we can subscribe to the event
03:58 - from the class name and it will be an
04:00 - event of type event handler and we're
04:03 - going to call it on tick the event
04:06 - handler is part of the system namespace
04:08 - and we want to send the tick as the
04:12 - event arguments so let's go here make a
04:14 - public class on tick event args which
04:18 - implements event args and inside we're
04:21 - simply going to have the public and for
04:23 - our tick and this event handler won't
04:26 - send of the subtype Quantic event arts
04:29 - so we can send the current tick okay
04:31 - great so now down here when we are
04:33 - creasing the tick letters fire that
04:36 - event so if it is different from now so
04:38 - if we have subscribers to this event
04:41 - let's send it with this sender and nuan
04:45 - tick event arts with the tech equals
04:47 - this tick alright so the event is set up
04:50 - when the tech increases it fires this
04:51 - event so that someone can listen and do
04:54 - something about it like for example
04:56 - let's remove the pop-up from here and
04:58 - we're going to put it on the game
05:00 - handler so here let's subscribe to the
05:03 - event going to the time tech system dot
05:05 - on Tech we're going to subscribe it gets
05:08 - an object sender and a time take system
05:11 - dot on tick event args and the on take
05:14 - event args has the tech inside the on
05:17 - take event are so Y dot Tech in here all
05:20 - right so let's s and we should be seeing
05:22 - the exact same thing as before yep there
05:24 - you go the time tech system is firing
05:26 - off the events the game handler is
05:28 - capturing it and displaying a pop-up all
05:30 - right so now let's make the construction
05:32 - code to see the time tech system in
05:34 - action in the building coding here let's
05:36 - also receive an end for the ticks to
05:39 - construct this is the amount of ticks
05:42 - that it takes to construct this object
05:44 - let's store it as a very long so private
05:47 - and build tick and private in bill tick
05:50 - max we're going to set the max till it
05:54 - takes to construct and the bill tick
05:57 - we're going to set it to 0 let's also
06:00 - store a boolean while it is in
06:02 - construction so a private ball is
06:04 - constructing and in here let's subscribe
06:08 - to the time tech system on tick so in
06:14 - here on tick if we are constructing so
06:17 - if is constructing which up here is
06:21 - going to start off by default apps true
06:25 - so if you are constructing let's
06:27 - increase the bill take what is equal to
06:31 - 1 and here what's test if it is fully
06:33 - constructed so if bill tick is bigger
06:37 - than bill take max then the building is
06:42 - fully
06:44 - so let's change is constructing two
06:46 - phones and let's hide the constructing
06:49 - world bar so let's first store a
06:51 - reference in here constructing world bar
07:01 - if it is not fully constructed then the
07:05 - building is still under construction so
07:09 - we're going to update the world barn set
07:15 - the size which takes a normalized value
07:18 - and normalize value will be the belltech
07:20 - divided by film tick max since both of
07:23 - them are integers let's multiply it by
07:25 - one F so here we are calculating a
07:28 - normalized value between belltech and
07:30 - Ville Tech max we are setting the
07:31 - construction world our size and when it
07:34 - is completed the bar gets hidden and is
07:37 - constructing sets to folks so just for
07:39 - fun let's also change the sprite once it
07:41 - is in construction
08:14 - alright so in here I'm simply setting
08:17 - the sprite to a different state based on
08:20 - the percentage that it is being built so
08:23 - in here when we construct a building
08:24 - let's say that it's going to take three
08:27 - ticks to construct so let's see if
08:29 - everything is working fine alright it
08:32 - takes our still increasing right I click
08:34 - in there and that one starts
08:36 - constructing it changes the sprite
08:37 - changes again and boom gets completed
08:41 - the bar hides and everything is perfect
08:43 - so I can create multiple each of them
08:45 - are independent but the code for the
08:47 - timer is only executing once on the
08:49 - time.take system alright great
08:51 - everything is working exactly as we want
08:54 - it now depending on your game there
08:55 - might be some actions you want to
08:57 - perform less often than the actual tick
08:59 - rate for example if you're storing stats
09:01 - to display a graph at the end of the
09:02 - game you probably don't need one data
09:04 - point per tick since each tick is only
09:07 - 200 milliseconds so for these cases it's
09:10 - useful to have other less frequent tick
09:12 - events so on our time tech system let's
09:15 - make another event in here called on
09:17 - tick 5 and down here when we increase
09:21 - the tick let's do a mod calculation so
09:24 - if tick mod 5 equals zero then we're
09:30 - going to fire the on tick 5 event
09:37 - so this tick won't fire every time tick
09:40 - is a multiple of five mod is a remainder
09:43 - of the division so when it is zero it
09:45 - means that tick is a multiple of five so
09:47 - this won't take on five ten fifteen and
09:49 - so on so on our game handler let's
09:51 - subscribe to the on take five event and
09:56 - let's say make it tick okay so let's
09:59 - test and there are your multiple takes
10:01 - when it gets to five you get a mega tick
10:04 - and we can still construct buildings and
10:06 - everything is not working perfectly fine
10:08 - so there you have it we created a time
10:10 - tick system that we can use to run logic
10:12 - less often then on update without having
10:14 - loads of timers scattered throughout our
10:16 - again this enables you to have time
10:18 - based logic on any object even without
10:20 - using monobehaviour if you have any
10:22 - questions post them in the comments and
10:23 - I'll do my best to answer them subscribe
10:25 - for more videos and I'll see you next
10:27 - time
10:38 - you
