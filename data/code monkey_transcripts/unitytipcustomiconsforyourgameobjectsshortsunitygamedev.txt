00:00 - here's a quick unity tip on the
00:01 - inspector next to the game object you
00:03 - see this button
00:04 - click on it and you can set a preset
00:06 - icon or a custom one
00:08 - this makes it very easy to find a
00:09 - certain object in the editor
00:11 - but do make sure you have gizmos enabled
00:13 - and this also works in the game view
00:14 - just enabling gizmos and the icon is
00:16 - there
00:16 - for another tip gizmos can change
00:18 - between 2d and 3d
00:20 - just click the arrow icon and change
00:21 - between 3d and 2d this will either take
00:24 - the camera position into account or
00:25 - ignore it and display a normal standard
00:27 - size
00:27 - and here's yet another tip you've got
00:29 - various icons and if you choose one of
00:31 - these
00:31 - it says the name of the object with a
00:33 - colored background very useful if the
00:35 - object name is something you want to see
00:36 - rather than an icon alright hope that's
00:39 - useful subscribe for more tips
