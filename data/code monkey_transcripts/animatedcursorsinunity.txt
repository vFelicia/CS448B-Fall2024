00:00 - in this video we're going to set up a
00:01 - nice custom cursor icon it will be
00:03 - animated and won't change depending on
00:05 - what object were hovering over this is
00:07 - an excellent way to provide more context
00:09 - to your player let's begin
00:14 - [Music]
00:18 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:20 - and this channel is all about helping
00:22 - you will learn how to make your own
00:23 - games with enough tutorials made by a
00:25 - professional indie game developer so if
00:27 - you find the video helpful consider
00:28 - subscribing
00:29 - check out the code monkey app on Steam
00:31 - interactive tutorials complete games and
00:33 - more click knowing the description and
00:35 - add it to your wish list all right so
00:37 - here's our gone over here is a simple
00:38 - character just idling around now you can
00:41 - look at my cursor right now and see that
00:43 - it's a simple arrow but it's different
00:44 - from the default one and now if I mouse
00:46 - over the character if there you go you
00:49 - can see the mouse changed to indicate
00:50 - that I can interact with this unit now I
00:52 - can click on it and there you go the
00:54 - unit is now selected and over here I
00:56 - have some basic RTS controls and we made
00:58 - in a previous video and with the
01:00 - character selected you can see that the
01:02 - mouse is now different the cursor is
01:04 - animated and it's essentially indicating
01:06 - that I can move my character around now
01:08 - over here on the left side there's a
01:09 - nice object and again as I mouse over
01:12 - yep there we go we have a nice scrubbing
01:14 - animation so I can right click my
01:16 - character goes there and picks up the
01:17 - item then down here we have some more
01:20 - enemies and again as soon as the mouse
01:22 - passes over there you go the mouse is
01:24 - converting into a nice attack cursor so
01:27 - it's nicely animated telling me that I
01:29 - can click on this unit in order to
01:31 - interact and attack it I can also
01:33 - deselect and without the unit's selected
01:34 - there you go it goes back into the
01:36 - normal arrow icon so here you can see a
01:38 - whole bunch of uses for a custom
01:40 - animated cursor which really enhances
01:42 - the play experience and gives the player
01:44 - some more information now you can easily
01:46 - add tons more animations to fit whatever
01:48 - actions your game actually has now if
01:51 - you haven't played it yet then go check
01:52 - out my game survivor squad gauntlets
01:54 - which is included in the game bundle and
01:56 - uses animated cursors extensively in
01:58 - order to provide more information to the
02:00 - player this video is made possible
02:01 - thanks to these awesome supporters go to
02:04 - patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to
02:06 - get some perks and help keep the videos
02:08 - free for everyone alright so this our
02:10 - goal let's get to it ok so here we are
02:12 - in our starring scene all we have is a
02:14 - simple character here just standing
02:16 - around I have some simple RTS mouse
02:18 - controls that we built in a previous
02:19 - video so I can click to select my
02:22 - character and then click anywhere to
02:24 - move it there's an atom in here so I can
02:26 - click he moves towards it and grabs the
02:28 - atom and there's a bunch of enemies here
02:30 - so I can click to
02:31 - and as you can see right now there are
02:33 - no cursor icons so every action is using
02:37 - the same basic default mouse cursor this
02:39 - would definitely look a lot better if we
02:41 - had a nice custom cursor depending on
02:43 - what's underneath our mouse so let's do
02:45 - just that here in our project files
02:47 - let's create a new C sharp script let's
02:50 - call this our cursor manager let's make
02:53 - a game object and drag the script on to
02:57 - it okay now in here this will be our
02:59 - manager script so this script will be
03:01 - responsible for setting the active
03:03 - cursor and playing off the animations so
03:05 - let's start off by just seeing how we
03:07 - can change the starting cursor so let's
03:09 - make a basic voice start and then here
03:13 - in order to change the cursor we use
03:15 - cursor dot set cursor now this as you
03:18 - can see requires a texture so let's set
03:20 - a film for it
03:26 - okay and let's set it in the editor so
03:29 - here let's drag our texture and in the
03:31 - project files I have a whole bunch of
03:33 - textures for the various cursive types
03:35 - that we're going to use and over here on
03:37 - the import settings you can see that
03:39 - they are all being important of texture
03:41 - type cursor so let's select and use our
03:43 - basic default arrow
03:45 - all right there's our texture now back
03:47 - in our script let's use the cursor
03:50 - texture in here and then we have the
03:52 - hotspot so this is the offset from the
03:55 - top left side of the texture so for here
03:57 - is the error icon open up on Photoshop
03:59 - and as you can see over here the edge of
04:02 - the arrow is right there on 1010 so
04:05 - that's what we use in here for our
04:08 - hotspot we pass in new vector2 of 10 10
04:11 - and then we have the cursor mode so this
04:15 - word we define either a software or
04:17 - hardware cursor so difference being that
04:19 - the software cursor gets updated
04:20 - whenever the screen updates so if your
04:23 - game is now running at a very high frame
04:24 - rate and software cursor will look
04:26 - slightly off and the hardware cursor is
04:29 - directly modifying the actual cursor for
04:31 - the operating system so it looks perfect
04:33 - even if the game is running at a low
04:34 - frame rate so in any case the one we
04:36 - choose is simply automatic so it's
04:39 - always hardware if possible and we'll go
04:41 - down to software if not all right so
04:44 - just like this should be
04:45 - and we should be able to see our cursor
04:47 - using our custom cursor texture let's
04:49 - test and yep as soon as the game runs we
04:52 - now have our own custom cursor awesome
04:54 - alright so now that the basics are
04:56 - working let's add some animations so the
04:59 - way we're going to do that is instead of
05:00 - a single texture we're going to play
05:02 - textures over time so in our film
05:05 - instead of having just one texture let's
05:07 - have an array of texture then we define
05:11 - an int for our current frame then also a
05:16 - float for our frame timer and another
05:20 - int for the frame count and another
05:24 - float for the frame rate so all these
05:27 - films won't allow us to easily animate
05:29 - our textures so for the current frame
05:31 - that's the current frame on the entire
05:32 - array then the frame timer that's going
05:35 - to be the time elapsed on the current
05:36 - frame the frame count will be the total
05:39 - size of our array and the frame rate
05:40 - won't be how fast we shared between
05:42 - frames so we're going to have our cursor
05:44 - texture array and let's also expose
05:46 - these two so we expose the frame count
05:49 - and the frame rate so now here back in
05:52 - the editor let's set our fields let's
05:54 - use the nice move animated cursor so
05:57 - we're going to have two textures let's
05:59 - put this one and this one so in the
06:01 - frame count that's eternal amount so in
06:02 - this case it's two and then the frame
06:05 - rate let's try playing them at let's say
06:08 - 10 frames per second so point one okay
06:11 - so back in the code here let's make a
06:12 - simple update and on update and let's
06:15 - countdown our timer alright so here it
06:28 - is we simply count down the frame timer
06:30 - by time.deltatime when it's under zero
06:32 - then we increment by the frame rate we
06:35 - also increment the current frame by one
06:37 - and we use the remainder in order to
06:38 - move back to zero and we simply call our
06:40 - set cursor function so there it is very
06:43 - simple let's test here we are in yep
06:46 - there we have our very nice and made it
06:48 - custom cursor awesome ok so now that we
06:51 - have our animated cursor next let's say
06:54 - the ability to have several different
06:56 - ones so back in the code here what
06:59 - first start off by creating a new for
07:00 - our cursor types so let's make a public
07:03 - in own called our cursor type and for
07:08 - now let's make the arrow Andy grab
07:09 - cursors now we're going to need all the
07:12 - frames for each cursor type so let's
07:14 - make a simple class to home of that data
07:16 - so down here let's create a public class
07:20 - let's call this our cursor animation and
07:24 - inside let's store a film for our cursor
07:26 - type then I'm going to have the things
07:30 - that we need from up here so we need a
07:33 - texture to the array then we're also
07:37 - going to need a float for the framerate
07:39 - and finally we also need a vector to for
07:43 - the cursor offset all right so that's
07:46 - all that we need and now up here let's
07:49 - make a list of our class and we're going
07:54 - to set this in the editor so let's make
07:56 - this a serialized film and now in art
07:58 - for a custom class you show up in the
08:00 - editor we also need to go down here and
08:02 - add the attribute system dot
08:05 - serializable if you don't add this then
08:08 - this custom class will not show up in
08:09 - the editor okay so this should be
08:11 - working let's go back into the editor
08:13 - and yet we have our cursor animation
08:15 - list and now let's add our two types so
08:19 - here we have our two elements first one
08:21 - for the arrow of the second one for the
08:22 - grab and let's film this up alright so
08:24 - there it is about various textures and
08:26 - one with the frame rate and the offset
08:28 - now in here we're using just a simple
08:30 - class to fill in our data but if you'd
08:33 - like you can easily convert all this to
08:34 - work with script of all objects instead
08:36 - so if you wanted to implement the system
08:38 - in a more let's say designer friendly
08:40 - way then that would be one way you could
08:42 - do it but for now then this simple
08:44 - approach won't work just fine
08:45 - so back in the code here let's make a
08:48 - function to set our active cursor type
08:52 - and let's start in a field so on an
08:59 - update we're going to use this one
09:01 - instead
09:01 - so appearin let's get rid of the one on
09:03 - the textures
09:10 - all right so just like that so we call
09:13 - this function in order to set our cursor
09:15 - and mission and then this is the one
09:17 - that we use on our update so logic is
09:19 - working exactly the same now just for
09:22 - testing let's add some inputs so here on
09:24 - update so when I press the T let's load
09:30 - up the cursor animation on index 0 and
09:33 - on Y the one okay so let's test okay so
09:36 - for sirs here we have our normal arrow
09:38 - cursor so this one just has a single
09:40 - frame so no animation now press the
09:42 - button and there you go now we have our
09:44 - second type of cursor and I'll press
09:47 - another button and back to the first one
09:48 - so first second and so on all right so
09:50 - we can now swap our active animated
09:53 - cursor awesome now let's work on making
09:55 - it activate automatically depending on
09:57 - what the mouse is hovering so here in
10:00 - the scene I have once you have objects
10:01 - and one in here is the item now this
10:05 - item already has a simple Collider so
10:07 - that's what we're going to use in order
10:09 - to detect when the mouse is hover
10:10 - so for that let's make a very simple
10:12 - script so in you see sharp script call
10:15 - this our cursor object and let's drag it
10:18 - on to our item okay now in this script
10:20 - all we're going to do is add the
10:22 - functions for the mouse so we're going
10:25 - to have on Mouse enter and also on Mouse
10:29 - exit so these are centered functions by
10:33 - model behavior so they get called
10:35 - whenever the mouse is over the collider
10:37 - and whenever it exits now let's set a
10:39 - fuel for our cursor type so cursor
10:44 - manager that cursor tight and now back
10:49 - in the editor over here for our item
10:51 - let's select the grab cursor so now we
10:54 - need this to have a function in order to
10:56 - modify the cursor so let's go back into
10:58 - the cursor manager in here and let's
11:00 - expose that function now we need to know
11:05 - the cursor and mission that matches this
11:06 - time
11:15 - all right so there it is very simple we
11:17 - just cycle through our cursor animation
11:19 - list and return the one that matches the
11:21 - type that we're looking for so we can
11:23 - now go up here and simply call this
11:25 - function down here the set active cursor
11:27 - animation and we get the cursor
11:29 - animation of this cursor type alright so
11:33 - we need this to call this function in
11:34 - order to modify our cursor and actually
11:37 - up here instead of accessing the list on
11:40 - start well let's call this function and
11:42 - passing the arrow so by default we have
11:45 - the arrow down here and let's get rid of
11:47 - our testing and I only need over here on
11:50 - our cursor object is to call that
11:51 - function so that means we also need a
11:53 - reference to this script so we can do it
11:56 - by making a simple singleton so here we
12:03 - have a static instance of our cursor
12:04 - manager so back in the cursor object we
12:07 - access the manager access the instance
12:09 - in order to count functions to set the
12:11 - active cursor type and pass in this
12:13 - cursive type all right that's pretty
12:16 - much it and when we exit let's use the
12:19 - arrow okay let's do it
12:22 - let's test so here we have the normal
12:25 - arrow cursor and as I go over the item
12:27 - if there you go now there's a grab move
12:29 - out and there's the arrow arrow grab and
12:31 - so on all right awesome
12:33 - so just like this our cursor is
12:35 - correctly selected depending on what
12:37 - object it is hovering now all we need is
12:39 - just to expand upon all of this so first
12:42 - let's have the other cursor types so we
12:45 - just need to add them over here on our
12:47 - home so there select attack and move now
12:52 - we need to fill up the rest of the
12:54 - fields in the editor
13:02 - all right so here's all the data again
13:06 - instead of doing it this way you could
13:07 - use the script on my object but in here
13:09 - it works now we need this to add our
13:11 - script on to these various objects for
13:15 - example over here on the unit let's add
13:17 - the cursor object and this one let's
13:20 - select the Select cursor and over here
13:23 - on the enemies drag the cursor object
13:24 - and this one is the attacker sir okay
13:27 - that should do it
13:28 - let's test okay so here we are and we
13:30 - start off with the arrow cursor okay so
13:32 - far so good
13:32 - now let's mouse over the unit and if
13:35 - there you go it changes into the unit
13:36 - selection now if I move away yep there
13:39 - you go back into the area now go into
13:41 - the item yep there's the grab with the
13:42 - animation and I move away yep back into
13:45 - the arrow and finally over here the
13:47 - enemy and I mouse over and there you go
13:49 - there's a nice attack animation all
13:51 - right so everything is working correctly
13:52 - we have all of our cursors correctly
13:54 - working so everything is working I can
13:56 - select the character over there is the
13:58 - item there's a nice cursor so I move it
14:00 - I grab it over here I click on top of
14:02 - the enemy any of there you go it all
14:04 - looks great all right now just one more
14:07 - thing let's what about the arrow for a
14:09 - move cursor once again it is actually
14:11 - selected now in order to do that there
14:13 - are many approaches we can take so we
14:15 - could for example make the RTS script be
14:17 - responsible for deciding what cursors
14:19 - should be used so that would be one
14:21 - approach another valid approach that
14:23 - might be easier is simply to use an
14:25 - event so let's go without so we're here
14:27 - on the cursor manager let's go all the
14:29 - way up and now let's create an event so
14:34 - we have a on cursor changed event now
14:36 - it's the weight custom event args all
14:42 - right here it is now I also cover the
14:44 - events in detail in another video so
14:45 - check that out to learn more so we have
14:47 - our event and down here whenever we
14:50 - modify our active cursor type and let's
14:52 - fire off that event all right just like
14:56 - this we have our nice event and now over
14:58 - here we have the game RTS controller so
15:01 - this one was made in the previous video
15:02 - and now in here we can listen to that
15:05 - event so we make a start go into the
15:07 - cursor manager instance we subscribe to
15:11 - that event
15:12 - and then in here we're going to check if
15:15 - the cursor has changed into the air one
15:18 - and if so then we test if we have unit
15:20 - selected and if so then we use the move
15:24 - cursor instead all right just like that
15:28 - and finally also down here when we
15:31 - deselect our units if we have none
15:35 - selected then we also go into normal
15:36 - error all right that should do it
15:39 - let's test okay here we are and so far
15:42 - so good we have the arrow and all the
15:44 - other cursors are working so the attack
15:46 - the selection unit and the item yep all
15:49 - of them working now if I select the unit
15:51 - if there you go now the cursor has
15:54 - changed into the move cursor so I can
15:55 - now move it around I can attack and so
15:58 - on and now if I deselect if there you go
16:01 - back into normal arrow cursor so there
16:03 - it is we have some external logic in
16:05 - order to make our cursors more
16:06 - responsive so here you can see how we
16:08 - can very easily add some nice animated
16:10 - cursors which help the game look better
16:12 - and much more responsive so go ahead and
16:15 - draw some nice cursors for whatever
16:16 - actions you have in your game now if you
16:19 - haven't played it yet then go check out
