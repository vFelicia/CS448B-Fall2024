00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your KMI Unity
00:03 - recently had their yearly unite
00:04 - conference I was there and it was great
00:06 - to meet tons of people in a previous
00:08 - video already did a quick summary of the
00:10 - keynote which is the most important talk
00:11 - in all of these events then the second
00:13 - most important talk that one is the road
00:15 - map which I just made available they
00:17 - just published the entire recording
00:18 - there's a link in the description if you
00:19 - want to go see the whole thing for
00:20 - yourself but here are my quick
00:22 - highlights although honestly there's
00:23 - quite a lot of stuff coming in the
00:24 - future so my quick summary isn't as
00:26 - quick as I would like and if you use
00:28 - unity in anyway check out my ultimate un
00:30 - over course the goal here is to help you
00:32 - learn how to make better games faster by
00:33 - teaching you about tons of unity tools
00:35 - that can be super useful that you might
00:37 - not know about I just put out the fifth
00:38 - free update making in total s lectures
00:40 - each covering a different tool or
00:42 - feature of the engine check it out to
00:43 - the link in the description starting off
00:45 - with the most obvious one which is the
00:46 - naming scheme starting next year Unity
00:48 - will go into a regular version number so
00:50 - instead of being named off the year it's
00:52 - simply named Unity 6 but that's really
00:54 - it it's just a name change so instead of
00:56 - next year having the 2023 LTS inste it
00:58 - will simply the 6 it won't work just
01:01 - like an LTS and I believe it's meant to
01:03 - come out towards the end of the year now
01:04 - in terms of things coming in the future
01:06 - there's a ton of stuff lots of info on
01:08 - graphics on new platforms there's a
01:10 - bunch on multiplayer and of course a
01:11 - bunch on AI perhaps surprisingly there
01:14 - is barely a mention of Dots here there's
01:16 - only a vague mention of an integration
01:17 - at the very end now I spoke to Laura at
01:19 - unite and from what I understand their
01:21 - goal right now this year their goal is
01:22 - pretty much a stabilization their goal
01:24 - is really just focusing on the core and
01:26 - getting that nice and stable they're
01:27 - actively listening to all the feedback
01:29 - from all the dev that are currently
01:30 - using dots in production and they are
01:32 - taking all that feedback and pretty much
01:33 - making the core as stable as it can be
01:35 - before they start adding tons of
01:36 - features personally I believe that is a
01:38 - good plan really focusing on the core
01:39 - before adding tons of stuff but of
01:41 - course that does mean that right now
01:42 - there's not much being announced so
01:44 - maybe 2025 maybe that won't be the year
01:46 - of dots now one very big part about this
01:48 - road map is on the entire multiplayer
01:49 - section and for this entire section I
01:51 - would say the keyword that stood out for
01:53 - me is pretty much streamline pretty much
01:55 - everything they announce that is coming
01:56 - in the future is meant to make
01:57 - everything simpler and easier to work
01:59 - with for example there is a multiplayer
02:01 - Center coming soon this one looks quite
02:03 - interesting you basically pick from a
02:05 - handful of preset game genres then set a
02:07 - bunch of fields like how many players is
02:08 - it fast-paced or slow paced and then
02:10 - tells you the various Unity gaming
02:12 - Services tools that would be helpful in
02:13 - that genre and allows you to very easily
02:15 - install all of them in just one click l
02:18 - i also mentioned a bunch of specific
02:19 - game templates are coming soon so it's
02:21 - going to be interesting to see what
02:22 - genes they focus on in order to help you
02:24 - iterate faster they are continuing to
02:25 - work on the multiplayer play mode if you
02:27 - followed my free multiplayer course and
02:29 - you know how it actually takes quite a
02:30 - bit of time to make a proper build in
02:31 - order to test anything in multiplayer so
02:34 - this tool which pretty much lets you run
02:35 - multiple instances of unity at the same
02:37 - time this one should really help speed
02:39 - up iteration then relay integration is
02:41 - also supposedly going to be quite a bit
02:43 - simpler just press a button and it
02:44 - should work for the multiplayer play
02:46 - mode they're also making it work very
02:47 - easily with a dedicated server and
02:50 - speaking of dedicated servers they're
02:51 - also streamlining just how easy it is to
02:53 - push a build to that dedicated server I
02:55 - made a tutorial on using Game Server
02:57 - hosting and for that you need to
02:59 - manually make a build you need to
03:00 - manually upload it to the dashboard and
03:02 - then manually start and then you can
03:03 - connect so simplifying that entire
03:05 - process to just a simple button click
03:07 - that sounds awesome and then they are
03:08 - pretty much taking streamlining to the
03:10 - max by announcing something called the
03:11 - multiplayer Services SDK so basically
03:13 - all these Services these won't work with
03:15 - just a single SDK now there aren't many
03:17 - details on this so I'm not entirely sure
03:19 - what this means but it does seem how
03:20 - instead of just initializing each
03:22 - service individually you can just work
03:24 - with the SDK and somehow initialize all
03:25 - the men at once that does sound like it
03:27 - would streamline things but I'm not
03:28 - entirely sure how this is meant to work
03:30 - in technical terms different Services
03:32 - require different setups so I'm not sure
03:33 - how exactly they're going to streamline
03:35 - this process but I'm definitely curious
03:36 - to hear more does sound interesting
03:38 - something also great is they are adding
03:40 - a new distributed Authority mode meaning
03:42 - instead of just one host you can
03:43 - actually have multiple players that have
03:45 - authority over certain parts of the
03:46 - world the one question I have right away
03:48 - is so does this mean that netod for game
03:50 - objects is now going to support much
03:52 - more types of games for example could
03:54 - you make a complex large open world MMO
03:56 - something like that in N for game
03:58 - objects if each player does does have
04:00 - authority over a certain part of the
04:01 - world then technically that should be
04:02 - possible so that sounds interesting as
04:05 - you can see from all this there's lots
04:06 - of stuff on multiplayer they already got
04:08 - a ton of tools I already covered a quick
04:10 - video on a whole bunch of those tools so
04:12 - with all these tools that already exist
04:14 - streamlining all that process in order
04:15 - to be able to use them that sounds like
04:17 - a really great Focus then the other big
04:19 - improvements coming in the future are
04:20 - obviously on Graphics this is something
04:22 - that visually looks good of course and
04:24 - because of that most of this was already
04:25 - shown on the keynote itself coming in
04:27 - un6 is the GPU resident raar then
04:30 - there's also GPU calling and spatial
04:31 - temporal post processing these are three
04:34 - features that apparently are enabled
04:35 - with just a single button click and make
04:37 - every scene run pretty much faster now
04:39 - for me as someone who is not a graphics
04:40 - programmer I always enjoy hearing how
04:42 - with just one button click my game won't
04:44 - perform faster then coming in the future
04:46 - are adaptive Pro volumes these look
04:48 - really awesome they're already available
04:49 - right now in agrp and unity 6 they will
04:51 - also be coming to urp supported on both
04:54 - mobile PC and consoles these let you
04:56 - have some really high quality lighting
04:58 - it almost looks R traced but but
04:59 - importantly at a fraction of the cost it
05:01 - supports data streaming for super large
05:03 - worlds it works with VFX particles and
05:05 - you can make it per pixel or per vertex
05:07 - so all in all this feature looks really
05:09 - awesome it looks like it will really
05:10 - impact the lighting quality of pretty
05:12 - much every un game then the VFX graph is
05:14 - also getting a bunch of improvements
05:16 - there's going to be a custom hlsl block
05:18 - allowing you to write custom shed code
05:20 - and work directly with VFX ra it is
05:22 - getting support for 6way lighting in
05:24 - order to make your particles look much
05:25 - much better it will also support motion
05:27 - vectors which from I understand allows
05:29 - you to build some really complex things
05:31 - and it will support spawning details
05:32 - which sounds like an interesting use
05:34 - Case by the way if you want to learn how
05:35 - to use the regular decal projector I
05:37 - just added a lecture to it on my latest
05:39 - free update to my ultimate unity over
05:41 - course then Shad graph is also getting a
05:42 - bunch of improvements one interesting
05:44 - one is a heat map color mode this one
05:46 - basically tense your Shader graph nodes
05:48 - in different colors depending on how
05:50 - performance intensive they are this
05:51 - should be really good for helping you
05:52 - make your shaders much more performant
05:54 - there are also a bunch of new samples I
05:56 - really want to find the time to be able
05:57 - to look at these I've seen a few of them
05:58 - they look really ni nice then a bunch of
06:00 - General performance improvements for VR
06:03 - it is getting fiated rendering this is a
06:05 - really excellent feature that I really
06:06 - hope a lot more games are going to start
06:07 - to adopt and agrp is also getting a
06:09 - bunch of enhancements to their water
06:11 - lighting and so on so rendering does
06:13 - seem to be improving quite a lot in
06:14 - unity 6 and a lot of it in ways that
06:16 - benefit even people like myself who
06:17 - don't really push visuals to the Limit
06:19 - then the future of platforms as always
06:21 - Unity continues to support pretty much
06:23 - any platform that exists the big one
06:24 - coming soon is the Apple Vision Pro and
06:26 - vision OS Unity was right there as soon
06:28 - as the official announcement was
06:29 - announced the device is coming next year
06:31 - and you can right now start working with
06:33 - the vision o SDK Sometimes the best
06:35 - thing you can do is simply be early on a
06:37 - brand new device so if you have some
06:39 - interesting ideas for the Apple Vision
06:40 - Pro then maybe look into the SDK and
06:42 - maybe get something ready right before
06:44 - launch AR and VR are also getting a
06:46 - bunch of improvements there's
06:47 - crossplatform input hand tracking and
06:49 - gestures and a bunch of project
06:50 - templates I still haven't found the time
06:52 - to be able to touch VR but it's amazing
06:54 - to see how it keeps improving day by day
06:55 - year by year another big platform is
06:58 - mobile and apparently only one huge
07:00 - addition is adding support for mobile
07:01 - web support this is what got the most
07:03 - amount of Applause during the road map
07:05 - talk now I'm not a mobile expert but
07:07 - apparently it's a big deal to be able to
07:09 - run Unity on a mobile web browser
07:11 - without requiring it to install a native
07:12 - app related to that is web GPU this is
07:15 - the new standard that is currently being
07:16 - worked on that technically grants the
07:18 - browser direct access to the GPU this
07:20 - would make rly intensive games possible
07:22 - even on just a simple web browser that
07:24 - does sound really interesting although
07:25 - from what I understand this Stander is
07:27 - still very much in its infancy so
07:29 - believe it is still going to take quite
07:30 - some time until this is properly
07:31 - implemented in every browser in order to
07:34 - help you build for these platforms that
07:35 - is going to be a very expanded build
07:37 - profiles window this seems like a really
07:39 - great addition to once again streamline
07:41 - everything so with this there will no
07:42 - longer be a need for making complex
07:44 - editor build scripts you can just do it
07:46 - straight from this window make as many
07:47 - profiles as you want for debug for rless
07:50 - builds for supporting Android iOS
07:51 - windows and so on so this one of those
07:53 - things that looks tiny but should be
07:55 - extremely helpful and then obviously
07:56 - they are working a ton on AI sentes is
07:59 - their on device model which is available
08:01 - right now and they've already released
08:02 - early access to their Muse tool stack
08:04 - there's Muse chat Sprite and texture
08:06 - that are available right now and
08:07 - behavior animate and sketch those are
08:09 - coming soon one Improvement that I
08:11 - definitely want to see is just how
08:12 - quickly will Muse chat learn about new
08:14 - Unity features personally that use case
08:17 - seems extremely useful to me whenever I
08:18 - make videos on some new tool I have to
08:20 - do a ton of research that involves a lot
08:22 - of reading documentation a lot of trial
08:24 - and error I have to do all that because
08:26 - when I cover some brand new tool there
08:27 - are no tutorials so being able to ask M
08:30 - chat some questions about some new tool
08:31 - I think that could help me in my own
08:33 - process they're also planning to
08:34 - continue improving the models for
08:36 - texture and Sprite and for this I would
08:38 - say they definitely do need to do that I
08:40 - only briefly used these tools in a live
08:42 - stream a while ago and I definitely
08:43 - found the output to be subpar it works
08:45 - for super quick prototypes but not much
08:47 - else basically the issue as it were the
08:50 - issue is that they are actually doing
08:51 - things the right way they're licensing
08:53 - all the data to make sure there are no
08:54 - copyright issues for you as a developer
08:57 - that's a great thing but of course
08:58 - because of them being being slow and
08:59 - careful that means those tools are quite
09:02 - underdevelopment when compared to any
09:04 - other tool basically right now these
09:05 - generation tools these are outputting
09:07 - what the other AI tools were outputting
09:09 - about 2 years ago so they're quite a bit
09:11 - behind personally I do like their focus
09:13 - on actually solving the copyright issue
09:16 - I think that's a great thing and that is
09:17 - definitely something they should focus
09:18 - on but it does come at the cost of
09:20 - quality so I do hope in next year they
09:21 - really improve these models then the big
09:23 - ones coming in the future are Behavior
09:25 - animate and sketch for Behavior this one
09:27 - won't let you design Behavior trees
09:29 - honestly for this one I'm not really
09:30 - interested in the AI specific Parts but
09:33 - that to all for having the various
09:35 - graphs for describing various Behavior
09:36 - States I think that tool even without
09:38 - some AI I think that could be very
09:40 - useful then for animate personally as
09:42 - someone who can't really animate
09:43 - anything for this one I'm very
09:44 - interested does sound quite useful and
09:46 - for sketch this one lets you create
09:48 - entire prototypes just based on natural
09:50 - language and importantly it is made with
09:52 - real-time collaboration in mind so I
09:54 - think this tool this one can be quite
09:55 - useful when doing something like a game
09:57 - Jam all in all AI is still a topic that
09:59 - a lot of people dislike so over the
10:01 - coming year they really need to make
10:03 - these tools look insanely useful in
10:04 - order to convince developers to actually
10:06 - use them in their workflow and then even
10:08 - further out there's a slide on the very
10:10 - far future basically their focus is
10:12 - still on iteration speed Andrew
10:14 - mentioned how the goals to have no
10:15 - loading bars that definitely sounds like
10:17 - great Focus then upgrading their net
10:19 - version and continuing to upgrade to
10:21 - Corr and like I said lots of dots
10:23 - entities integration that won't come
10:25 - over time after the core is nice and
10:26 - stable so as you can see from all this
10:28 - there's Lots coming in the future Lots
10:30 - on Graphics multiplayer and really just
10:32 - making everything more streamlined Unity
10:34 - definitely made a big blender when they
10:36 - announced the runtime fee which will
10:37 - start to take effect on this version
10:39 - unit6 even with the changes they made to
10:41 - it and how the final proposed fee even
10:43 - how that sounds pretty reasonable
10:45 - despite that a lot of people still feel
10:46 - like they broke their strust so they
10:48 - need to work really hard to regain that
10:50 - and thankfully looking at this unite
10:52 - keynote and road map it does seem like
10:53 - they're working really hard to make un6
10:55 - a really awesome version all these
10:57 - updates sound really awesome so I'm
10:58 - definitely looking forward to seeing all
10:59 - of this come to fruition I'm curious to
11:01 - hear your thoughts on this what did you
11:03 - think about the keynote and now the road
11:04 - map in general if you want you can go
11:06 - watch eone 1 hour road map video there's
11:08 - even more detail on some of these topics
11:10 - and a bunch more that I didn't have time
11:11 - to cover also check out my ultimate D
11:14 - over course to help you make better
11:15 - games faster all right so thanks for
11:17 - watching and I'll see you next time
