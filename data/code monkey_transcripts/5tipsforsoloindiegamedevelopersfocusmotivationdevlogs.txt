00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - here's an interesting video five tips
00:03 - for Indie solo game developers let's
00:05 - watch it and I'll share my thoughts
00:07 - based on my 10 years of experience
00:08 - making Indie Games before we begin just
00:10 - a quick mention the unity Humble Bundle
00:12 - is ending in about 2 days this one is a
00:14 - great deal with a ton of tools and a
00:15 - bunch of visual assets and the unity
00:17 - asset store is also having their new
00:18 - year sale pretty much all of the top
00:20 - sellers all of the best assets and tools
00:22 - all of those are discounted and there's
00:23 - even a coupon for an extra 10% off or
00:25 - specifically if you're looking for low
00:27 - poly assets then the C sale is also
00:29 - having their great holiday sale as usual
00:31 - it's their excellent style so if you're
00:32 - a fan of it definitely check it out
00:34 - hello and welcome to my humble little
00:36 - Channel I am the sole developer of an
00:38 - upcoming 2D Run and Gun platformer
00:40 - titled Citadel Stormer 2 I have spent
00:42 - the last two years single-handedly
00:44 - working on this project right away my
00:46 - tip would be don't spend two years
00:47 - working on a project especially not your
00:49 - very first game this is one of those I
00:51 - would definitely call it a mistake that
00:52 - a lot of people fall through my advice
00:55 - to you is do not spend that long
00:56 - especially not dur your very first game
00:58 - you really gain a lot more experience by
01:00 - working on multiple games as opposed to
01:01 - just one single game where you spend
01:03 - tons of years my advice is make quick
01:05 - games at the beginning make games on the
01:07 - scale of some like Flappy Bird or sake
01:09 - so something really small that you can
01:10 - build in one to two weeks then as you
01:12 - grow perhaps start making games in 3
01:14 - months perhaps one for six months I
01:16 - would only really encourage someone to
01:18 - build a game and spend two years working
01:19 - on a game if that's like your fifth or
01:21 - sixth game if you have quite a lot of
01:23 - experience and at that point spending
01:24 - that long might work I've handled the
01:27 - coding the art the music and the design
01:29 - of the levels enemies bosses and various
01:31 - in-game objects during this process I
01:34 - believe I have gained a few valuable
01:35 - insights on what it takes to create a
01:37 - game from scratch tip one stay focused
01:41 - don't get distracted by new ideas yeah
01:44 - absolutely great tip lots of people
01:46 - they've got an idea for the game but as
01:47 - soon as they work on it for about a
01:49 - month they suddenly get bored of that
01:51 - idea and they start wanting to add more
01:52 - things or work on something completely
01:54 - different being able to stay focused on
01:56 - actually focusing on your game and
01:58 - actually finish that one game before you
01:59 - move move on to the next thing that is
02:01 - one skill that you do gain with
02:02 - experience so that's the good news so if
02:03 - you have trouble with that if you're
02:05 - constantly jumping from Project to
02:06 - project that is something you can
02:08 - definitely work on you can definitely
02:09 - improve that and I'm talking about
02:11 - switching from game idea to game idea
02:13 - but the same thing can happen on the
02:14 - same project you're working on one
02:16 - mechanic and suddenly you jump into a
02:18 - completely different mechanic than
02:19 - another one and so on so being way too
02:21 - distracted that can definitely happen in
02:23 - both terms of games as well as
02:24 - individual mechanics and systems so yep
02:26 - definitely do keep that in mind and
02:28 - don't get distracted way too much
02:29 - remember to say Focus remember what is
02:31 - your initial goal with this game what is
02:32 - the original idea and only work on
02:34 - things that actually work towards
02:35 - getting that idea to completion once you
02:38 - have a general idea of what your game
02:39 - will be like Define your goals create a
02:41 - checklist of tasks and focus on
02:43 - completing them yep checklist that is
02:45 - something that I highly encourage you to
02:47 - do for me personally that is one of the
02:49 - best productivity tips that I can give
02:50 - you working from list for me I find that
02:53 - so much better read than just looking at
02:54 - an empty Unity project and thinking okay
02:56 - where do I even start if you have a to-
02:58 - list you just take some time time in
03:00 - order to figure out what are the various
03:01 - items you're going to add on to the list
03:03 - and then when you're actually going to
03:05 - spend some time working on the game you
03:06 - can just work straight from that list so
03:08 - just look at one of those elements and
03:10 - pick okay I'm going to work on this one
03:11 - and that's it personally I make two list
03:14 - for just about anything so all my daily
03:16 - tasks I have to-do lists my monthly
03:18 - goals I have to-do lists for my game
03:20 - that I'm currently working on dinky
03:21 - Guardians for that I have a to-do list
03:23 - of all the things that I need to do so
03:25 - yeah my advice to you definitely make
03:27 - tons of lists it's much much easier to
03:29 - keep working and stay focused if you're
03:30 - working from M list during the course of
03:32 - the project you will keep getting new
03:34 - ideas these new ideas can fall into two
03:36 - categories the first category includes
03:38 - ideas that can be integrated into your
03:40 - current project like a new weapon or
03:42 - enemy type these are good make a note of
03:44 - them and add them to your
03:46 - checklist yep whenever you get a new
03:48 - idea I definitely encourage you to
03:49 - essentially do a brain dump just take
03:51 - that idea take it from your brain
03:52 - actually write it down somewhere if you
03:54 - keep it inside your brain that is going
03:56 - to constantly keep you distracted so
03:58 - just write down keep a stack of paper of
04:00 - excellent ideas that you want to work
04:02 - either on your current game or whatever
04:03 - comes next the important thing is take
04:05 - it away from your brain put it on
04:07 - somewhere else where it does not
04:08 - distract you the second category
04:10 - consists of ideas for a completely
04:12 - different game these are bad however the
04:14 - freshness and Novelty of those ideas May
04:16 - tempt you to abandon your current
04:18 - project and start a fresh new one ideas
04:20 - for new games aren't necessarily bad
04:22 - again as long as you don't constantly
04:24 - jump from Project to project so if you
04:26 - have a game idea for something
04:27 - completely different that you would like
04:28 - to do I would encourage you just write
04:30 - that down the idea somewhere either
04:32 - write it down on paper or just open a
04:34 - simple text file on your computer
04:36 - personally I have tons of ideas all over
04:37 - the place I've got lots of papers with
04:40 - lots of random game ideas I've got notes
04:42 - on my phone I've got notes on my
04:43 - computer so once again whenever you have
04:45 - some idea for something little different
04:47 - the important thing is take it away from
04:48 - your brain and put it somewhere so it
04:50 - doesn't distract you you can do that
04:52 - then go back to being focused on you're
04:53 - working on your current game and when
04:55 - you finish that then you can revisit
04:57 - that list of ideas and figure out what
04:58 - to work on next based on the exciting
05:00 - New Concepts that have just popped into
05:01 - your mind but do not take the bait
05:04 - because doing so would completely negate
05:06 - all the time and effort you have already
05:07 - invested in your original goals and put
05:09 - you right back at the starting point of
05:10 - the game dep process furthermore even if
05:13 - you choose to pursue the new project
05:15 - there is no guarantee that you won't
05:16 - later abandon it to pursue a newer and
05:18 - fresher set of ideas yeah again that's a
05:21 - problem jumping from Project to project
05:22 - so definitely make sure you don't do
05:24 - that in the end you would have spent all
05:26 - that time and effort doing Game Dev but
05:27 - have nothing to show for it except a
05:29 - pile of Unfinished games tip two don't
05:32 - neglect The Not So enjoyable parts of
05:34 - the project like any other creative
05:36 - Endeavor Game Dev has both fun and non-f
05:38 - fun Parts yeah for me the non-f fun
05:41 - Parts those would be handling music and
05:43 - sound effects for some reason that is
05:44 - something that I absolutely hate to do I
05:47 - really hate cycling through dozens or
05:49 - hundreds of sound effects in order to
05:50 - find whatever matches whatever I'm
05:52 - working on I always hate working with
05:54 - music trying to figure out what music
05:56 - actually fits my game another thing that
05:58 - I really dislike is all of the artwork
06:00 - that is required in order to make
06:01 - something like a steam page in order to
06:03 - make screenshots that is always
06:05 - something that I really dislike doing
06:06 - but again it must be done if I want to
06:08 - release the game the game needs to have
06:09 - screenshots it needs to have a trailer
06:11 - which is another thing that I really
06:12 - don't like doing it needs to have music
06:14 - sound effects so yep definitely game Tav
06:16 - can be quite a lot of fun there are
06:18 - definitely a lot of things that I really
06:19 - enjoy I love making new systems I love
06:21 - writing tons of code but if you want to
06:23 - finish your game yep there are some not
06:25 - so fun parts that you will have to push
06:26 - through the fun parts are usually the
06:28 - easy and more enjoyable tasks examples
06:31 - of these would be making conceptual
06:32 - sketches writing lore generating new
06:35 - ideas and so on while these things are
06:37 - important in their own right as a solo
06:39 - developer be careful not to get too
06:41 - caught up in them it creates the
06:43 - illusion of being productive but at the
06:44 - end of the day you'll have nothing to
06:46 - show for it a notebook full of Concepts
06:48 - and game ideas is worthless if those
06:50 - ideas aren't implemented in a game
06:51 - project yeah again I mean you do have to
06:54 - go through the not so fun Parts you
06:56 - can't just procrastinate on them some
06:58 - things they must be done done no matter
07:00 - whether you like to do more or not a
07:02 - game has to be a complete package in
07:03 - order to actually be a complete final
07:05 - game so just remember that making games
07:07 - isn't always going to be super fun when
07:10 - you spend too much time on the fun Parts
07:12 - you usually end up neglecting the less
07:14 - glamorous yet vital tasks such as coding
07:16 - and debugging tasks that are essential
07:17 - to ensure that it and again it's really
07:19 - funny how personal preference he
07:21 - mentions coding and debugging as
07:23 - negatives personally that's the part
07:24 - that I love the most so yeah it's just
07:26 - funny how everyone has different tastes
07:28 - everyone has different things everyone
07:30 - has different definitions of what is the
07:32 - fun and not so fun parts of game
07:33 - development game functions as intended
07:36 - while the fun parts may be enticing
07:38 - neglecting the fundamental technical
07:39 - aspects can undermine the overall
07:41 - quality and functionality of the game it
07:43 - is important to strike a balance between
07:45 - enjoying the creative aspects and giving
07:47 - due attention to the critical backend
07:48 - work that brings the game to life
07:50 - approach the project holistically and
07:52 - divide your tasks appropriately allocate
07:54 - dedicated time for the dull and boring
07:56 - stuff even if it's not as enjoyable for
07:58 - you yeah again definitely remember you
08:00 - do have to do the not so fun parts so my
08:03 - advice is just add them to the list and
08:05 - at some point one day when you feel nice
08:07 - and strong go ahead and just tack on
08:09 - those just spend one day trying to get
08:11 - to as much of the nonf funds part as
08:13 - possible get through those and just
08:14 - remind yourself okay I'm doing the not
08:16 - so fun parts so I can actually finish
08:18 - the game which is the ultimate goal
08:20 - remember that the dry backend work is
08:22 - crucial to bring your artistic Vision to
08:23 - life and ensure you have a functional
08:25 - game in your hands yep remember what is
08:27 - the ultimate goal without those not so
08:29 - fun Parts you cannot release the game so
08:31 - just push through them learn to balance
08:33 - the fun and challenging aspects of
08:35 - development tip three don't start
08:38 - peripheral activities like video devlogs
08:41 - it's tempting to start a devlog or even
08:43 - a YouTube channel dedicated to
08:44 - showcasing progress on your game and
08:46 - video format yeah this is a tricky one
08:49 - on the one hand I understand the the
08:51 - advice which is basically don't get
08:53 - distracted it's basically the same
08:54 - advice and of course time is very
08:56 - limited so should you spend your time on
08:59 - things things outside of your game the
09:00 - answer is sort of sort of not I guess
09:03 - that depends on what are your goals with
09:04 - the game because if your goal is to
09:06 - actually find success like Financial
09:08 - monetary success if so then marketing is
09:11 - something you cannot neglect it is one
09:13 - of the most important things it is
09:15 - extremely difficult and making Dev Vlogs
09:17 - making YouTube channel making YouTube
09:19 - shorts Tik toks whatever making all
09:21 - those things is all part of marketing
09:23 - which is part of making a successful
09:25 - game now if you're just doing it as a
09:26 - hobby if you're just doing it for fun
09:28 - then sure you can ignore all of that you
09:29 - don't have to worry about marketing but
09:31 - if you want to make games as a
09:33 - profession if you want to make it a
09:34 - career then marketing is something you
09:36 - absolutely need to do and Dev Vlogs are
09:38 - one of the most straightforward ways to
09:39 - do it so yep it does take time it does
09:41 - take quite a lot of time away from game
09:43 - development I you know I mean balancing
09:45 - this channel making all these videos and
09:47 - working on my seam game that is
09:49 - definitely being quite challenging quite
09:50 - difficult but I know that if I don't do
09:53 - that then the game will simply not find
09:54 - an audience at all so yeah it is really
09:57 - difficult in order to balance it takes a
09:58 - ton of time time it takes a ton of work
10:00 - a ton of effort but in today's world the
10:02 - reality is simply you have to do that
10:04 - there's simply no way if you want to
10:06 - find success with your games and
10:08 - marketing is something you must do it
10:10 - sucks it takes a lot of time but it
10:11 - simply must be done seen many solo devs
10:14 - do it in the hopes it may draw attention
10:16 - to their game but the cold fact is that
10:18 - unless you already have a substantial
10:19 - following on YouTube maintaining a video
10:21 - devlog is an absolute waste of time and
10:24 - energy I I disagree with that I mean I
10:27 - agree that it is extremely difficult I
10:29 - mean YouTube is pretty much just as
10:31 - saturated as Steam is so it definitely
10:33 - is extremely difficult in order to stand
10:34 - out with devlog you've got to bring
10:36 - something really special really unique
10:38 - so I don't disagree with the fact that
10:40 - it's really difficult but like I said it
10:42 - is something it must be done I mean any
10:44 - kind of marketing must be done and
10:45 - devlogs are simply the sort of easiest
10:48 - way to do marketing or the most
10:49 - straightforward one at the same time
10:51 - that is really great feedback I mean if
10:53 - you're making devlogs about your game
10:54 - and nobody's watching them nobody's
10:56 - clicking on them perhaps that might mean
10:58 - that you simply have haven't yet learned
10:59 - all the skills required in order to be
11:01 - successful on YouTube or perhaps it
11:03 - might mean that your game idea perhaps
11:04 - isn't quite as appealing as you'd like
11:06 - so that can also be some very useful
11:08 - feedback in order to decide should you
11:10 - spend a lot more time on this game or
11:11 - not it goes back to what I mentioned in
11:13 - the beginning should you spend years
11:14 - working on a game I would say if you
11:16 - can't get traction on your devlogs then
11:18 - absolutely do not spend years or several
11:20 - months working on the game take that as
11:22 - feedback because if people are not
11:23 - interested in watching your Dev vogs
11:25 - that is a sign that they will not be
11:26 - interested in actually playing the final
11:28 - game let me explain first attracting
11:32 - viewers and growing your channel from
11:33 - scratch is an uphill task this is due to
11:35 - YouTube's algorithm favoring established
11:38 - creators uh that is not quite the case
11:41 - anymore over the past few years the past
11:44 - I don't know 5 seven years YouTube has
11:46 - definitely changed previously the amount
11:48 - of subscribers were a huge amount that
11:50 - was a huge impact if you had millions of
11:53 - subscribers you would guarantee millions
11:54 - of views whereas nowadays that is no
11:56 - longer the case nowadays with just a
11:58 - single video you can definitely pop off
12:00 - you can definitely go viral it is
12:01 - definitely difficult to grow on YouTube
12:03 - like I said it's pretty much as
12:04 - saturated as team is but thankfully
12:06 - nowadays if you come out of the gate
12:08 - with just one really excellent devlog
12:10 - and if your game ID is actually
12:11 - appealing and if you study the basics of
12:13 - YouTube the basics of how to make a good
12:15 - title a clickable thumbnail if you do
12:17 - that you can definitely find success it
12:19 - is really difficult but it is possible
12:22 - so it's quite likely that you'll be
12:23 - making videos that not many people will
12:25 - discover let alone watch if that's the
12:27 - case the question of growing your
12:29 - channel goes out the window lastly there
12:32 - is zero to little guarantee that all
12:33 - your endeavors in running a YouTube
12:35 - devlog would result in tangible benefits
12:37 - such as publicity fan acquisition or
12:40 - sales of the final product one really
12:42 - interesting thing that I've noticed
12:43 - since pretty much making this channel is
12:45 - that there's actually a big difference
12:47 - between a Game Dev audience and a
12:49 - gameplaying audience initially when I
12:51 - first started this channel one of the
12:53 - goals behind it was essentially
12:54 - basically I'm going to use the knowledge
12:56 - that I've gained over the past I don't
12:58 - even know 10 years making games use that
13:00 - in order to teach you how to make games
13:03 - and as a result the audience that will
13:04 - enjoy learning from those videos they
13:06 - will then pick up my games and that will
13:07 - help my games become more successful but
13:10 - what I have found since then is that yep
13:11 - there's a big difference between a Game
13:13 - Dev audience and a game playing audience
13:15 - so my audience on this channel is more
13:16 - towards the game da audience which means
13:18 - it doesn't really convert into game
13:20 - players as much as you would think
13:21 - whereas on the other hand there's a for
13:23 - example a channel like Danny that is
13:25 - pretty much on the entertainment side as
13:27 - opposed to game dep side so that one
13:29 - attracts much more game players as
13:30 - opposed to game developers and in that
13:32 - case it does convert very well
13:34 - considering these factors there is
13:35 - little justification to believe that a
13:37 - YouTube devlog warrants the expenditure
13:39 - of time and effort all that said a
13:42 - YouTube channel would be useful to store
13:44 - trailers and gameplay footage to share
13:45 - when needed but creating highly edited
13:47 - devlogs can be a significant drain on
13:49 - resources and if you must document your
13:51 - progress consider using a simpler
13:53 - platform such as Twitter which allows
13:55 - you to reach a wider audience oh now
13:58 - that is very bad advice I would say like
14:00 - I was saying a while ago difference
14:01 - between a game da audience and
14:02 - gameplaying audience from all the stats
14:04 - that I've seen Twitter is not a place to
14:06 - find a gameplaying audience if you go on
14:08 - Twitter and you post a bunch of gifts on
14:10 - things like screenshot Saturday or wish
14:12 - list Wednesday or whatever if you do
14:14 - that you will reach quite a few people
14:16 - but those will be once again those will
14:18 - be game developers and not game players
14:20 - Twitter is actually the absolute worst
14:22 - place you find players for a game in
14:24 - terms of marketing Twitter should be at
14:26 - the very bottom of your list and in
14:28 - terms of wasting Resources by making
14:30 - devlogs on the one hand yep that is true
14:32 - I mean if no one watches your devlogs
14:34 - then that's a little bit of a waste but
14:35 - at the same time like I said if you want
14:37 - to find success nowadays you need
14:38 - marketing and if you don't Market your
14:40 - game then essentially all the effort you
14:42 - put into your game will essentially be
14:45 - wasted tip four don't hyperfocus on one
14:48 - thing instead cover all things for any
14:51 - dedicated game developer it is natural
14:53 - to strive for presenting their game in
14:55 - the best possible manner however this
14:57 - Pursuit can sometimes turn into an
14:59 - endless cycle of Polish and refinement a
15:01 - developer May focus on perfecting and
15:03 - fine-tuning various aspects of their
15:04 - game often beyond what is necessary or
15:07 - practical yeah I would definitely say
15:09 - don't over focus on overp polishing just
15:11 - one particular aspect of your game
15:13 - remember in order for it to work it has
15:15 - to work as a whole so make sure the
15:17 - entirety of the game is on essentially
15:19 - the same level of quality the same level
15:20 - of complexity if you like make your
15:22 - Gunplay feel extremely polished but your
15:25 - enemies are essentially just prototype
15:26 - enemies that won't feel very strange
15:28 - very often footing so yeah do make sure
15:30 - you spend the same amount of effort on
15:31 - pretty much every part of your game or
15:33 - essentially based on how important that
15:35 - part is to your game and at the end
15:36 - definitely do make sure to Polish Polish
15:38 - is an extremely important thing and do
15:40 - make sure you polish pretty much every
15:41 - mechanic as much as possible while
15:43 - attention to detail and quality are
15:44 - crucial becoming fixated on incessant
15:46 - polishing can lead to delays and a lack
15:48 - of progress while dedicating lots of
15:51 - time to perfecting one particular aspect
15:53 - of a game for example the main
15:55 - character's design or a specific art
15:57 - asset can result in a pol outcome It
15:59 - ultimately becomes feudal if other
16:01 - crucial elements of the game are
16:02 - neglected in the grand scheme of things
16:04 - focusing excessively on one aspect of
16:06 - your game while neglecting others
16:08 - hinders progress yep definitely I mean
16:11 - it is very important to polish things
16:12 - but not to the detriment of everything
16:14 - else hyperfocusing on one task eats into
16:17 - your time and prevents you from
16:18 - completing the hundreds of other tasks
16:20 - that your game needs remember there's no
16:22 - point in perfecting one thing if the
16:24 - other things in the game do not get made
16:26 - a single task no matter how important
16:28 - should not take up all your time yep
16:31 - again remember the game is composed of a
16:33 - hole it is composed of a multitude of
16:35 - systems and mechanics all working
16:37 - together so you cannot for example just
16:39 - spend your entire Dev time just making
16:41 - the shooting feel great if there are no
16:43 - enemies to shoot at or no levels to
16:44 - explore then doesn't really matter if
16:46 - the shooting works because needs a hole
16:48 - in order to actually make a final
16:49 - complete
16:50 - game tip five don't rely on motivation
16:55 - cultivate discipline instead this is
16:56 - definitely a tip that I highly inally
16:58 - agree with something that I've mentioned
17:00 - many times yep do not rely on motivation
17:03 - motivation is something that is very
17:04 - ephemeral it comes and goes you have no
17:07 - control over it it is great when
17:08 - motivation comes and Things become super
17:10 - easy but the development of a game even
17:13 - if you make a short game even if you
17:14 - make something on like 3 to six months
17:16 - you will definitely not stay motivated
17:18 - for that whole time so my advice is
17:20 - definitely do not rely on motivation
17:22 - make sure you rely on discipline inste
17:24 - once again work from a list make sure
17:26 - you have a list of things that you need
17:27 - to do and just go ahead and do them one
17:29 - by one whether you feel like it or not
17:31 - the Journey of game development is a
17:33 - difficult one filled with hurdles that
17:34 - can easily wear you out demoralize you
17:37 - and cause you to abandon your goals
17:38 - motivation is essentially an emotion and
17:40 - can increase or decrease depending on
17:42 - external factors there will be times
17:44 - when motivation disappears
17:46 - altogether yep I mean game development
17:48 - is a long journey it is really difficult
17:50 - it involves a ton of work it involves a
17:52 - ton of systems a ton of different unique
17:54 - skills and motivation just comes and
17:56 - goes you can't really control it so yep
17:58 - do not rely on motivation if you want to
18:00 - finish your game then take that
18:01 - seriously and actually work on it
18:02 - actually finish it step by step day by
18:04 - day no matter how you feel about it in
18:07 - contrast being disciplined is a mindset
18:09 - it is a way of living or seeing things
18:11 - that pushes you to get things done it
18:13 - can be considered as an engine that
18:14 - propels you forward and sustains you
18:16 - throughout the entire Journey discipline
18:18 - is the source of other qualities like
18:19 - perseverance and dedication discipline
18:22 - is the secret to success in any field
18:24 - game development
18:25 - included when you feel worn out
18:27 - motivation disappears but the discipline
18:30 - that you have cultivated will drive you
18:31 - to continue working on your game project
18:34 - yep definitely when motivation
18:35 - disappears it's up to you to R out on
18:37 - self-discipline although at the same
18:39 - time I should say do not take it to the
18:41 - other extreme meaning to the point where
18:43 - you're focused so much on
18:44 - self-discipline to the point where you
18:46 - actually start to feel bad about
18:47 - yourself when you eventually fail we're
18:49 - all human no one is perfect so even if
18:50 - you rely on self-discipline there won't
18:52 - be times when no matter how much you try
18:54 - you simply cannot do it you simply
18:56 - cannot force yourself to do it and when
18:57 - that happens the answer is really just
18:59 - accept it just say Okay sadly this
19:01 - happened suddenly today I cannot push
19:03 - myself through it just do that and
19:05 - accept it as opposed to essentially just
19:07 - punishing yourself for not being able to
19:08 - do something if you do that will not
19:10 - help in any way that will just make you
19:12 - feel like crap which in turn hurts your
19:15 - development on the next day and so on so
19:17 - do rely on self-discipline but when you
19:19 - eventually fail to force yourself to
19:20 - work when that happens just accept it
19:23 - and move on do not punish yourself when
19:24 - something goes wrong I believe these
19:26 - tips will help your solo game Vel opers
19:28 - avoid fatigue stay organized and ensure
19:31 - that you reach your game development
19:32 - goals all right so yeah that was the
