00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey So
00:02 - lately I've been working on my upcoming
00:04 - C course my goal is for the video part
00:06 - of the course to be free kind of like my
00:08 - kitchen chos course and then have an
00:10 - optional paid version in a future video
00:11 - I'll talk about my specific plan to make
00:13 - free courses with optional paid versions
00:15 - and do so in a sustainable manner right
00:17 - now I'm still working on this one I've
00:18 - already fully written the beginner and
00:20 - the intermediate sections covering lots
00:21 - of things if I was just making a normal
00:23 - video course it would almost be done by
00:25 - now but I really wanted to make
00:27 - something special so I've been working
00:28 - on a really interesting companion
00:29 - project project to help you learn better
00:31 - basically the absolute best way to learn
00:33 - anything is to actually do something if
00:35 - you're an absolute beginner you don't
00:36 - learn much by just blindly watching a
00:38 - video you need to actually write code in
00:40 - order to learn and fully understand what
00:41 - the code is doing this is also why so
00:43 - many people get stuck in what they call
00:45 - tutorial Hill they just watch tons and
00:47 - tons of tutorial videos or courses but
00:49 - never actually do anything so they feel
00:50 - like they never graduate to being able
00:52 - to build their own projects so in order
00:54 - to help people truly learn lately I've
00:56 - been building some really interesting
00:57 - interactive exercises these basically
00:59 - ask you to to do something related to
01:00 - the lecture so the goal is watch the
01:02 - lecture learn everything from it and
01:03 - then actually put it into practice these
01:06 - exercises exist inside a Unity project
01:08 - and I basically built some really
01:09 - interesting editor Windows to handle all
01:11 - of it so on the top bar I can just go
01:12 - into the main window any here is pretty
01:15 - simple just a list of the various
01:16 - lectures and then for example let's say
01:18 - you watch a lecture on variables say you
01:20 - watch a lecture and pay very close
01:21 - attention then you come to this Unity
01:23 - project open up this main window and
01:25 - select this lecture on variables then
01:27 - there's a bunch of interesting things
01:28 - let's see the exercises and Yep this
01:30 - opens up the exercise window and now
01:32 - here we can see various exercise like
01:34 - let's say this one Define a speed
01:35 - variable so the goal with this one is to
01:37 - edit the script exercise. CS to declare
01:39 - a variable of type int with the name
01:41 - speed and assign the value five to it so
01:43 - now I can click on start exercise to
01:45 - start it and basically what this does is
01:47 - it adds a bunch of files that I prepared
01:49 - previously onto the project so now like
01:51 - the exercise says we need to edit this
01:52 - script so let's open it and following
01:54 - the goal we need to Define some kind of
01:55 - in variable but now in order to show
01:57 - another thing that I've also been
01:58 - building I'm actually going to
02:00 - intentionally write some bad code so I'm
02:02 - going to write int with capital so this
02:04 - is not going to work so int then let's
02:06 - call it speed equals 4 something like
02:08 - this okay so let's save this code and
02:10 - back into Unity any if down here is yet
02:12 - another window so this is the code
02:14 - monkey companion window and basically
02:16 - this window is listening to a bunch of
02:17 - errors that show up on the console and
02:19 - also has context of which exercise is
02:21 - active and using that I can show a much
02:23 - better window that should hopefully be a
02:24 - lot more explanatory than what you see
02:26 - over here in the console window since
02:28 - I've read literally thousand upon
02:30 - thousands of comments in all the videos
02:31 - that I've made for this channel because
02:33 - that I do know the common errors that
02:34 - beginners actually have so I can write
02:36 - some custom messages for some common
02:38 - errors that I know beginners do
02:39 - encounter so by looking at this message
02:41 - it should hopefully be more clear than
02:43 - the message over here in the console so
02:44 - did you accidentally type int or int
02:47 - instead of int remember how code is case
02:49 - sensitive so if a beginner made this
02:50 - mistake hopefully this should be clear
02:52 - so now let's go ahead and try replacing
02:54 - it with in and save and back into Unity
02:56 - wait for it compile and right now
02:58 - there's no error but the exerise is
02:59 - still in progress so still not done
03:01 - because like it says here we need to
03:02 - write the exercise exactly as it needs
03:04 - to as always in my course I always try
03:06 - to teach good practices and the best
03:08 - practice that beginners really need to
03:09 - learn is simply the fact that code has
03:11 - to be exact so over here I specifically
03:12 - made it to listen to an in type
03:14 - specifically made it listen to the speed
03:16 - name and specifically made to listen to
03:18 - the actual value so if the speed is not
03:20 - written examp like this like for example
03:21 - like I wrote here with capital S then
03:24 - this does not work and again on the
03:25 - competing window down here this one also
03:27 - shows a warning so again another message
03:29 - that should hopeful help you learn
03:30 - better then also these other buttons so
03:32 - there's one to show some kind of hint
03:34 - like I said these exercises are meant to
03:35 - be made after watching the lecture so
03:37 - for here I'm basically giving an end
03:39 - related to whatever I said in the
03:40 - lecture in this case this is a super
03:42 - basic exercise on the VAR bance lecture
03:44 - so this also super simple so here it's
03:46 - really just saying remember the syntax
03:48 - for how variables are declared and
03:50 - remember how code is case sensitive then
03:52 - for some reason no matter how hard I try
03:53 - I cannot complete the exercise if so I
03:55 - can always show the solution any up here
03:57 - it shows right away so the solution is
03:59 - this in speed equal 5 so now I can
04:01 - either do it myself or click on apply
04:02 - solution and this will actually apply
04:04 - the solution so the files over here in
04:06 - the project files these will be
04:08 - overwritten with ones that have the
04:09 - actual solution I made that so you can
04:11 - actually see the final solution before
04:13 - ending the exercise or alternatively you
04:14 - can just stop which is basically just
04:16 - going to delete these files from the
04:17 - folder over here let's just complete so
04:19 - over here the issue is just speed has to
04:21 - be equals to five let it compile and if
04:23 - there it is exercise completed all right
04:25 - awesome so we can complete the exercise
04:28 - and back into the list and we do see yep
04:29 - we have completed that exercise and we
04:31 - have these more left to do so I
04:32 - generally hope that this will help
04:34 - people learn better by actually doing
04:36 - things but this is also just one part of
04:38 - everything that I'm building so I'm
04:39 - building the exercise the companion
04:41 - window down here which is going to
04:42 - hopefully provide some much more helpful
04:43 - messages whenever there's an error or
04:45 - something that isn't quite right and
04:47 - then like we saw if we select the
04:48 - lecture over here there are two more
04:50 - types so there's an FAQ so these are the
04:53 - frequently asked questions so a bunch of
04:55 - questions again all related to that
04:56 - specific lecture so in this case the
04:57 - variables lecture so the goal is watch a
04:59 - lecture pay attention then come here and
05:01 - basically get a refresher on the various
05:03 - things so in this case what example is a
05:05 - variable a variable is basically a
05:06 - container for data so I highly encourage
05:08 - people after watching each lecture to
05:09 - come here and watch all the frequently
05:11 - asked questions and then of course
05:12 - there's also a really nice quiz so this
05:14 - one again some simple questions like
05:16 - what is the primary purpose of a
05:17 - variable in C so is the purpose to name
05:20 - a function to store data to execute
05:21 - commands or to create new data types and
05:24 - in this case yep a variable the goal the
05:25 - primary purpose is indeed to store data
05:27 - so yep that is correct and here is the
05:29 - answer with a bunch more detail so
05:31 - variables are containers for data and so
05:32 - on so with all of these windows with all
05:34 - this stuff I really hope that this C
05:36 - course will be really awesome for anyone
05:37 - who wants to learn and I'm going to
05:39 - cover topics from beginner to advance so
05:41 - no matter how much you know about C
05:43 - hopefully you will learn something with
05:44 - this course and with these tools I
05:46 - really do believe that you actually
05:47 - learn by doing rather than just plainly
05:49 - watching a course so this is why I'm
05:50 - putting so much work into building all
05:52 - this but also building all this
05:53 - obviously is a lot more work than just
05:55 - making the video so that is why I'm
05:56 - going to take a little bit longer to get
05:58 - everything done so it's still going to
05:59 - take a little bit but if you're
06:01 - interested you can go to the link in
06:02 - description to sign up and I'll let you
06:03 - know when the course is ready also on
06:05 - note for these windows as you might have
06:06 - seen these were actually built over here
06:08 - with UI Builder so I'm using the UI
06:10 - toolkit so right now I'm super busy
06:12 - working on the course but after I'm done
06:13 - when I get back to regular tutorials
06:15 - this is definitely going to be one topic
06:16 - that I want to cover I've been
06:17 - researching and learning how to use it
06:19 - in order to build all this and I've been
06:20 - pretty happy with just how useful this
06:22 - is UI to Kit is actually quite usable by
06:25 - now so definitely stay tuned for a
06:26 - tutorial on that sometime in the future
06:28 - and just a quick mention the assur is
06:30 - having the unity Awards asset sale for
06:32 - just two more days so if you need
06:34 - anything any tools any assets any kind
06:36 - of thing then definitely go ahead and
06:37 - check it out since these are all the
06:38 - assets that I've won awards pretty much
06:40 - all of these are awesome like for
06:41 - example just looking at this one I high
06:43 - recommend feel I high recommend text
06:45 - animator I use both of these in making
06:47 - my game dinking gardiens these are super
06:48 - awesome feel helps you make your game a
06:50 - lot more polished and text animator
06:52 - helps any kind of tax pop out and tons
06:54 - more really useful tools so if you need
06:56 - anything check it out to the link in the
06:57 - description and if you want to learn
06:58 - about any Unity tools or features and
07:01 - check out my ultimate unity overview
07:02 - this covers a mountain of stuff
07:03 - including many things you might not even
07:05 - know exist okay so now I got to get back
07:07 - to work on the C course still not sure
07:09 - when I'll be able to get it done but
07:10 - hopefully sometime within February I
07:12 - really hope this course with these
07:13 - interesting exercises and questions I
07:15 - really hope this will help people learn
07:16 - whether they're beginners or
07:18 - intermediates so definitely stay tuned
07:19 - for that all right thanks for watching
07:21 - and I'll see you next time
