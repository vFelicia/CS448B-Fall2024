00:00 - in this video we're going to look at the
00:02 - HD RP in unity AGR P stands for the
00:05 - high-definition render pipeline which is
00:07 - one of the default render pipelines that
00:08 - is targeted towards high-end systems
00:10 - with gorgeous visuals for example the
00:13 - latest unity shorty heretic was made
00:15 - using HDR P let's begin
00:20 - [Music]
00:24 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:27 - and this channel is all about helping
00:28 - you learn how to make your own games
00:30 - with NF tutorials made by a professional
00:32 - indie game developer so if you find the
00:34 - video helpful consider subscribing okay
00:36 - so let's look at HD RP first of all HDR
00:39 - P stands for the high-definition render
00:41 - pipeline it's one of the default render
00:43 - pipelines that are now part of the new
00:45 - SRP system or the scriptable render
00:47 - pipelines the other default one is the
00:50 - universal rendered pipeline so Universal
00:53 - is made with compatibility in mind so
00:55 - it's meant to run on every single device
00:56 - that unity supports and HD RP is meant
00:59 - for high-end systems and consoles with
01:01 - lots of options to produce some
01:02 - excellent visuals okay so there are two
01:05 - ways to get started with HDR P the
01:07 - simplest one is to use the new project
01:09 - HDR P template this video is made
01:11 - possible thanks to these awesome
01:13 - supporters go to patreon.com/scishow to
01:16 - code monkey to get some perks and help
01:17 - keep the videos free for everyone so
01:20 - here on unity hub you can click on new
01:22 - and over here you see the various unity
01:25 - project templates and you can just
01:27 - select high-definition RP then you just
01:33 - hit create
01:38 - and yet pure is the default scene
01:40 - created with a GRP and everything is
01:42 - already perfectly set up now another
01:44 - option is to add HD RP to an existing
01:47 - project so here I am in another project
01:49 - without a GD RP and now in order to use
01:52 - it we need to go into our window and
01:53 - open up the package manager and here we
01:56 - scroll down until we find the high
01:58 - definition RP and just click on install
02:10 - all right it's done so now this project
02:13 - is using HDR beam and these are our two
02:15 - options so he can start from scratch
02:17 - with the template or we have the package
02:20 - and upgrade an existing project into HDR
02:22 - P now if you're upgrading as soon as you
02:25 - have it installed you might see some
02:26 - errors so you can go over onto window
02:29 - render pipeline and over here you have
02:31 - the HD render pipeline wizard so open it
02:34 - up over here you see this window now
02:36 - this is an excellent little tool to help
02:38 - you very easily set up your project to
02:40 - work with a GRP you can see all the
02:43 - various issues contained within your
02:45 - project and you can fix them
02:47 - individually or simply go here click on
02:49 - fix all and wait a bit and yep just like
02:56 - this you can see that all the issues
02:58 - have been fixed so now our project is
03:00 - working perfectly correctly using a GRP
03:02 - great so here we have a fully working
03:05 - scene working with a GRP now the first
03:08 - thing you can do is go into edit and
03:10 - into our project settings and now here
03:13 - if we go under graphics then you should
03:15 - be able to see your default HD render
03:17 - pipeline asset assigned and here on the
03:20 - graphics tab you can set up the various
03:21 - quality presets so by default you have
03:24 - low medium and high then over here you
03:26 - have the a GRP default settings so you
03:29 - can set the various defaults for your
03:31 - camera vector custom reflection and the
03:33 - real-time reflections these events are
03:36 - really useful for defining the baseline
03:38 - settings of your game which you then can
03:39 - override as necessary so you have tons
03:42 - of options for the only web rendering
03:44 - then stuns morte for dealing with
03:46 - lighting and so on again these are just
03:48 - defaults and every single one of these
03:49 - can be overridden then down here you
03:52 - have the default volume settings then
03:54 - down here a bunch more settings for
03:56 - post-processing then still on the
03:58 - project settings over here you have the
04:00 - quality and there underneath you have
04:02 - the a GRP so here you can select the
04:04 - PowerPoint asset and modify a bunch more
04:06 - settings so by clicking on this is the
04:08 - same thing as if you go onto your
04:10 - project files and you select the AG
04:13 - render pipeline asset and there you go
04:15 - this is what is shown now one of the
04:17 - main features about a GRP is something
04:19 - called physical cameras this is
04:21 - essentially
04:21 - camera behave according to actual
04:23 - real-world physics which is a huge help
04:25 - especially if you're going for four
04:27 - realistic visuals so you select your
04:30 - camera so here is the main camera and
04:32 - now here under general you can see some
04:34 - pretty similar settings so you have the
04:37 - background type the sky background color
04:38 - and so on then over here you have the
04:40 - project you so right now as perspective
04:42 - then over here you have the fov settings
04:45 - and you can just modify them okay and
04:47 - then you have this nice little tag on
04:48 - saying link fov to physical camera so
04:52 - you can enable this and then down here
04:54 - you see the physical tab and in here you
04:56 - have a whole bunch of settings for a
04:58 - physical camera now if you're familiar
05:00 - with photography I so share speeds and
05:02 - all of that then this section is for you
05:04 - so here you can set everything according
05:06 - to real-world values so for example you
05:09 - can define the sensor type so let's say
05:12 - I want an eight millimeter yep there you
05:14 - go or a seventy or just make it custom
05:16 - then you can set up your ISO or shutter
05:19 - speed you can set the lens focal lengths
05:22 - so there you go you can modify the
05:24 - aperture and even modify the aperture
05:27 - shape so you can see how you have tons
05:29 - of settings and if you're into
05:31 - photography then you can really go crazy
05:32 - and set up the settings just as you
05:34 - would do in real life so this is great
05:36 - even if all you want to do is just take
05:38 - some really good-looking screenshots of
05:39 - your game world another great feature of
05:42 - a GRP is using msaa
05:44 - msaa stands for multi sampling
05:46 - anti-aliasing so it makes your game look
05:48 - really good with nice smooth edges but
05:50 - naturally it's quite resource intensive
05:52 - now to enable
05:54 - msaa first select the render pipeline
05:56 - asset and then over here you have the
05:58 - unlit shader mode and in order to
06:00 - support MSAA you must set it to either
06:02 - both or for it on a GRP only supports
06:05 - msaa in for rendering once he said it
06:08 - then you won't be able to see this
06:09 - drop-down menu for MSAA and over here
06:12 - you can set the number of symbols
06:13 - obviously the more you go the better it
06:16 - looks but it also becomes more resource
06:17 - intensive so here for example let's
06:19 - choose MSA a times 8 however just by
06:22 - setting this field we do not have MSA
06:25 - enabled just yet so over here is our
06:27 - team view and if we zoom in yep there
06:29 - you go lots of jagged edges so once we
06:32 - enable MSA on our pipeline asset then we
06:35 - also need to enable it either on our
06:36 - global settings or on a per camera basis
06:39 - so for example let's select our main
06:42 - camera so here are our camera settings
06:44 - and down here we have a toggle for
06:47 - setting custom frame settings so this
06:49 - will override the defaults that we saw
06:51 - previously
06:52 - so we some like this and now we can see
06:53 - all of our settings and here we can
06:55 - override anything on one of these by
06:57 - selecting on the check box on the
06:59 - website so for example over here MSA
07:01 - within Ford let's select it in order to
07:03 - override the setting so the default is
07:05 - disabled and now here I can override it
07:07 - and make it enable just for this camera
07:09 - so as I enabled it there you go now you
07:11 - can see MSA being applied so I can zoom
07:14 - out and zoom back in and yep there you
07:17 - go now we no longer have those very
07:19 - harsh edges so again you can enable this
07:21 - on a per camera basis or you can go back
07:24 - into the project settings select the a
07:26 - GRP default and over here you have MSA
07:29 - if you want to enable it by default for
07:31 - all cameras now since we're talking
07:33 - about anti-aliasing let's look at the
07:35 - other types we have so here on the
07:38 - camera we can override MSA down here yep
07:40 - but we also have another field in here
07:42 - for anti-aliasing so if you select you
07:45 - can see a drop down menu for various
07:47 - types of anti-aliasing so you have FX
07:49 - AAT AAA and sm AAA now these are
07:52 - separate from MSA a so right now you can
07:55 - see that over here we have set no
07:56 - anti-aliasing but our scene does have
07:58 - anti-aliasing so we're currently working
08:01 - with MSA a being applied so the way
08:03 - these two are separate is MSA is a point
08:06 - by the hardware as the camera is
08:07 - rendering anyway they're enable or
08:09 - disable it either globally or per camera
08:11 - and then you have these other types of
08:14 - anti-aliasing which are applied as a
08:15 - post-processing effect so you can stack
08:18 - them with MSA a or just use these ones
08:21 - and disable MSA for example FXAA
08:24 - is very fast and produces pretty decent
08:26 - results so you could add an option to
08:28 - your game to disable MSA a and enable FX
08:30 - a inset so here for example disable MSA
08:33 - and there you go very jagged and just
08:35 - enable FX a and there you go the wrong
08:37 - radial looks quite smooth or for example
08:40 - you can enable MSA and stack it with taa
08:43 - and then really increase the sharpness
08:46 - and there you have a
08:48 - interesting effect so as you can see you
08:50 - have tons of options so you can balance
08:52 - looking good or being performed
08:54 - post-processing is also slightly
08:56 - different now in a gr P nu R P so
09:00 - previously you have to install a
09:01 - separate package in order to add
09:02 - post-processing however right now it's
09:05 - built straight into the renders now the
09:07 - reason why it's now built in instead of
09:09 - separate is because while both the hg RP
09:11 - and you RP have pretty much the same
09:13 - effects they are using different
09:14 - algorithms so the AG RP effects are made
09:17 - for excellent visuals and super high
09:19 - quality while the u RP effects are made
09:21 - for compatibility and speed but in terms
09:24 - of usage it's pretty much the same as
09:25 - previously with the v2 stack so you can
09:28 - go into your hierarchy and create a new
09:30 - volume here let's make a global volume
09:33 - so it affects the whole scene and here
09:36 - in the inspector you can inspect the
09:37 - volume so in terms of mode you can have
09:39 - set it to global or an welcome and then
09:42 - you have the weight that you can play
09:43 - around it then you have the priority so
09:46 - the volume with a higher priority won't
09:48 - win out and then you have the profile
09:50 - now here if you remember back into the
09:53 - project settings here on default
09:56 - settings you can already see the volume
09:57 - components for the default volume
09:59 - profile asset so we're here as you
10:01 - create a new volume profile right now
10:04 - you can see that this volume profile
10:05 - apparently does not contain anything but
10:08 - really does not contain any overrides on
10:09 - top of these ones so these are defaults
10:12 - that get applied and then you can either
10:13 - override or not so for example here and
10:16 - let's add an override what's going to
10:19 - post-processing and let's add some color
10:21 - adjustments I just like that now we just
10:28 - applied some simple post-processing so I
10:31 - said this works pretty much the same as
10:33 - the previous v2 post-processing stack
10:35 - you can have any of these types of
10:37 - effects now another thing you can do is
10:39 - also play around with the mode so
10:41 - instead of global let's say we want to
10:42 - make this a local volume and when we do
10:45 - then we also must add a colon either
10:52 - so here we have a Collider for our
10:54 - volume now what this means is that these
10:56 - effects won't be applied but only when
10:58 - we're inside of our volume so right now
11:00 - on the outside you can see that the
11:02 - scene looks pretty normal and as I go in
11:04 - yep there you go now it turns into a
11:06 - different color because it's being
11:07 - applied with our post-processing so this
11:10 - is how for example you would make a
11:11 - global volume for the irregular lighting
11:14 - and effects on your scene and then let's
11:16 - say you have a local volume for any time
11:18 - you have an indoor scene so essentially
11:20 - in terms of usability if you're already
11:22 - familiar with the post-processing v2
11:24 - stack then you're already familiar with
11:25 - this one as well now the one difference
11:27 - is that the volume is no longer use just
11:30 - for post-processing it can be used for
11:32 - all kinds of settings so here when we
11:34 - click on add override yep there you go
11:36 - you can see all of these settings that
11:38 - are not necessarily related to
11:39 - post-processing so for example we can
11:42 - add some fog so for example we're adding
11:48 - some fog and messing around with
11:50 - distance so there you go our scene
11:51 - appears and dissapears then we could
11:53 - also play around with the exposure so
11:55 - increase it and make our scene much
11:57 - darker then we can also play around with
11:59 - lighting so here add some ambient
12:02 - occlusion and yet there you go it looks
12:04 - just like that so there you go then on
12:06 - top of all these effects you can also
12:08 - play around the d'void so right now the
12:10 - scene looks very different from default
12:12 - and if I go down on the white yep there
12:14 - you go goes back to normal and back in
12:15 - there and there you go so you could for
12:17 - example play around with the way through
12:19 - a script and get some really interesting
12:20 - effects like for example something like
12:22 - a day/night cycle another feature you
12:24 - have is dynamic resolution so this is
12:27 - great and it helps you maintain a stable
12:29 - frame rate by lowering or increasing the
12:31 - resolution dynamically now to enable it
12:34 - you select your AG render pipeline asset
12:36 - and inside our rendering tab we have a
12:39 - dynamic resolution and now in here we
12:42 - just click to enable it then when you do
12:44 - you can see a whole bunch of options
12:45 - specifically you can set the minimum and
12:48 - maximum percentage so for example just
12:50 - see the effect let's put the minimum at
12:52 - 10 and then the maximum just at 20 so
12:55 - this means that at most our game will be
12:56 - rendered only a 20% of our resolution so
12:59 - with 20% you would expect everything to
13:01 - look pixelated but right now it's um
13:02 - looks exactly the same
13:04 - that is because in
13:05 - for dynamic resolution to be used you
13:07 - also need to go back into your camera
13:09 - and here on the main camera down here
13:11 - you can see a toggle for allow dynamic
13:13 - resolution and as soon as we click if
13:16 - there you own our scene is very blurry
13:17 - because it's being rendered essentially
13:18 - at only 20% of our maximum resolution so
13:22 - this is obviously an extreme example
13:23 - just to show the effect in action so a
13:25 - practical use case would be to probably
13:28 - make the minimum at say like 50 and put
13:30 - the maximum at a hundred so on really
13:33 - low end machines it would render a small
13:35 - resolution and on a machine that can
13:37 - handle it it would render the normal
13:38 - film resolution so this is really
13:40 - helpful for ensuring your game is fully
13:42 - playable on just about any type of
13:44 - device however just like this we simply
13:46 - enable dynamic resolution right now it's
13:49 - not actually changing anything now in
13:51 - order to do that you need to make a
13:53 - script to define exactly what resolution
13:55 - scaling you should use so for example if
13:58 - you have a really intense part of your
13:59 - game then you can make your script set
14:01 - the resolution lower on that particular
14:03 - part and increase it afterwards and
14:05 - obviously the more general use case is
14:07 - simply setting a target to say something
14:09 - like 60fps and monitoring that in real
14:12 - time so you can increase or decrease the
14:14 - resolution to make sure you hit your
14:16 - target framerate check the manual page
14:18 - linked in the description to see how you
14:19 - set up that script another great feature
14:22 - of a GRP is how it supports physically
14:24 - based lighting meaning you can use
14:27 - real-world values to have your lights
14:29 - behave according to real-world physics
14:31 - so here on let's create the new light
14:33 - let's make it a point light so here I
14:36 - created the new light and you can see
14:38 - all of the various options for example
14:40 - over here on the emission here you can
14:42 - set the in light intensity and this as
14:45 - you can see it is based on real-world
14:47 - units so by default it's using lumens
14:50 - but you can click on the drop down menu
14:52 - in order to use different types of
14:53 - real-world units and also one neat thing
14:56 - is when you change from one into the
14:58 - other unity automatically does the
14:59 - conversion for you and you can also set
15:02 - the in light color so set it to
15:03 - something and instead of setting a comma
15:05 - directly once again you can choose the
15:07 - color temperature to set real world
15:09 - values in kelvins so let's say you want
15:12 - a more reddish light or a more bluish
15:14 - light then naturally you can set a
15:16 - normal light cookie then you also have
15:18 - volumetric
15:19 - so for example there's no light right
15:20 - there and you can enable or disable and
15:22 - then you can set up your shadows so you
15:25 - can see how you have tons of options and
15:27 - once again one of the main things is the
15:29 - ability to be able to set real world
15:31 - values all right so here we covered a
15:33 - whole bunch of things from a gr P
15:35 - however this is just an overview on how
15:37 - to actually get started there's tons
15:39 - more features that I haven't covered
15:40 - here and like shadows reflection probes
15:42 - more fog light layers ray tracing and
15:45 - many more the complete feature list is
15:47 - massive so check the manual linked in
15:49 - the description to see everything it
15:50 - offers so go ahead set up a scene with
15:53 - HG RP play around with the values and
15:54 - make some gorgeous games this video is
15:57 - made possible thanks to these awesome
