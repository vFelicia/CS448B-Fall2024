00:14 - games 20 years ago then moved on to fly
00:16 - and eventually got to unity through all
00:18 - that I made over 40 games and learn a
00:21 - ton along the way which are now sharing

00:46 - years how I got started making chat
00:48 - games then moved on to flash and finally
00:50 - to unity over all that time I've made
00:52 - over 40 games and more in the time this

01:11 - free for everyone my game dev journey
01:13 - started quite a very long time ago I've
01:15 - been making games using unity since 2012
01:18 - before that I made games with flash
01:20 - since 2008 and before that I was
01:23 - experimenting with programming making
01:24 - all kinds of games since I was about 10
01:26 - I started learning programming by
01:28 - modding Mirek which was a very nice and
01:30 - simple IRC chat client it was a great
01:33 - way to get started learning the basics
01:35 - of programming and logic
01:36 - it was mostly limited to text but the
01:39 - code was real and I found it fascinating
01:40 - to write code to tell machine what to do
01:43 - eventually I did a bunch of chat games
01:45 - like trivia hangman gets the number and
01:47 - so on so very simple stuff but it was
01:50 - enough to get me started on the idea of
01:51 - interactivity over time I was also
01:54 - interested in movies and animation so
01:56 - eventually I found my way into flash it
01:58 - was the best program to draw inanimate
02:00 - things
02:01 - it was frame by frame animation which is
02:03 - a very laborious way of animating but
02:05 - also extremely intuitive you just draw
02:07 - one frame then move the character a bit
02:09 - in the next frame and so on so as I was
02:11 - doing that it didn't take too long to
02:13 - see how I could also write code and
02:14 - flash so at that point my brain clicked
02:17 - and I realized that I could get the code
02:18 - and animations working together to
02:20 - create something amazing until then I
02:22 - had really just mostly made text-based
02:25 - games so the idea of adding some
02:26 - interactive visuals was insane I
02:28 - immediately started when they're
02:30 - thinking about all the amazing games
02:31 - that I could make the first flash
02:34 - version I tried was flash MX and I
02:36 - remember my parents buying me a great
02:37 - book about it I read the whole thing
02:39 - cover to cover and got better and better
02:41 - at writing code and merging it with
02:43 - visual
02:43 - and animations this was down back when I
02:46 - was a kid at around 1415 so I had no
02:49 - idea or any thought of turning this into
02:51 - a job I was just making cool stuff for
02:53 - fun so I kept doing things over time as
02:55 - my normal life went on so constantly
02:57 - learning and creating and in 2008 I
03:00 - randomly came across mochi ads this was
03:03 - an API that you could add to flash in
03:05 - order to play an ad before the start of
03:07 - the game and potentially make some money
03:08 - this was at the point where I started to
03:10 - think that maybe there was a possibility
03:12 - of making a job out of it
03:13 - so I went right for it learn all the
03:16 - basics really quickly learn all the
03:18 - various websites that existed and
03:19 - published my first game with the hope of
03:21 - making something out of it the end
03:23 - result was a game called freeway it's a
03:25 - very simple car avoiding game you have
03:27 - your car that you can move around the
03:29 - road is infinite in a straight line
03:30 - there are other cars that kept randomly
03:33 - spawned and there's a score being
03:34 - calculated so this was the first time
03:36 - that I made something that I could
03:37 - really call a game it had a complete
03:39 - albeit simple game design there were
03:41 - sound effects and music there were rules
03:43 - for winning and losing and player input
03:45 - in order to control the game so that's
03:47 - how I eventually got CERN a very simple
03:50 - very basic game but despite being simple
03:52 - it was still challenging to make since
03:54 - it was my first game now obviously ads
03:57 - are a notoriously difficult way to make
03:59 - money essentially you need millions of
04:01 - views in order to get a very basic
04:03 - decent amount so for that game it made
04:05 - something like 50 Cent's in the first
04:07 - few days that sounds like a meaningless
04:09 - amount but for me it meant that I had
04:11 - found a possible path as long as I got
04:13 - better at making games then the
04:15 - potential to turn it into a career was
04:17 - right there I just had to gain more
04:19 - experience and get a lot better so I
04:21 - just kept at it making many games one
04:24 - after the other all of them simple but
04:25 - all of them from start to finish I
04:27 - learned how to draw better in flash and
04:29 - managing animations I got better at
04:32 - ActionScript too and made more complex
04:34 - games later I moved to ActionScript 3
04:37 - which is pretty similar to c-sharp
04:38 - simulator it helped me quickly gets hurt
04:40 - with unity I made driving games action
04:43 - games shooting strategy puzzle
04:45 - management and so on it was all about
04:47 - constant learning and experimentation
04:49 - so I kept at it and eventually started
04:52 - selling games as sponsorships and making
04:53 - a tiny bit more money as I got better
04:55 - over the course of five years I made
04:57 - roughly 35 games and learned a ton
04:59 - however it was still nowhere near enough
05:02 - to support a basic life at its highest I
05:04 - was making something like 300 bucks a
05:06 - month even while living in Portugal
05:08 - that's still a pretty low wage however
05:10 - it was a lot more than the 50 Cent's
05:12 - that I get for my first game but again
05:14 - still not enough then in July of 2012
05:17 - team announced greenlight and at the
05:19 - time I didn't pay too much attention and
05:21 - just kept making flash games but it
05:23 - stayed in the back of my head so in
05:25 - December of that year after making a
05:27 - couple more games that still didn't get
05:28 - me minimum wage I started thinking of
05:30 - making a game to put on scene this was
05:33 - also when I started doing my research
05:34 - looking for how I could build a PC
05:37 - desktop game flash could technically do
05:39 - it but it wasn't really ideal so during
05:42 - my research that's when I found out
05:43 - about unity it ran on c-sharp which I
05:46 - had used for a bit and was very similar
05:47 - to ActionScript 3 it was capable of
05:50 - making bells for PC Mac and Linux it was
05:53 - used by a large community and it had a
05:55 - free version so with all that it
05:57 - instantly became my choice I download
06:00 - the unity started playing around with it
06:01 - and found it very capable and pre easy
06:03 - to use now before greenlight steam was a
06:06 - very closed off system essentially you
06:08 - had to know someone and have a top tier
06:10 - game to be able to even get a chance of
06:12 - getting on scene now the good thing
06:14 - about that system was if you did get on
06:16 - there you would essentially have
06:17 - guaranteed success and all the games on
06:20 - store had a very high quality bar the
06:22 - bad thing was that very few people could
06:24 - get in even if you had a very good game
06:25 - that would be perfect for a tiny niche
06:27 - so thankfully with green light it
06:29 - suddenly became possible to get on Steam
06:31 - and with all that I learned from making
06:33 - flash games for five years I grabbed
06:35 - that chance again flash games were a
06:37 - wonderful learning experience for me but
06:39 - not really profitable at its best I
06:41 - wasn't even getting anywhere near
06:42 - minimum wage so it was a great learning
06:45 - experience but in order to make it from
06:46 - free games with ads you really need
06:48 - millions of players whereas with a paid
06:50 - game you can get by if you just find a
06:52 - niche and make a game specifically for
06:54 - those players so I thought about what
06:56 - type of game I would like to make that
06:57 - would be played with a mouse a keyboard
06:58 - on a PC desktop one of the game series
07:01 - that I love this kid was swamped
07:03 - I love the tactics and the theme of cops
07:06 - versus robbers with a focus on trying to
07:07 - arrest people rather than just shoot
07:09 - everyone so when I thought of making
07:11 - playing mouse based it immediately came
07:13 - to my mind the goal was to make a 2d
07:16 - top-down SWAT game where you would
07:18 - control a group of officers and rest bad
07:20 - guys inside of a house however back then
07:22 - I was still very inexperienced so when
07:25 - making the AI for the SWAT guys to line
07:27 - up behind door kicked the door throw a
07:28 - flashbang in enter that complex scenario
07:31 - made me realize that I still didn't have
07:33 - anywhere near enough knowledge in order
07:35 - to be able to do that just yet
07:36 - and then I also came across a design
07:38 - problem that I had no idea two songs
07:40 - which is what led me to change direction
07:42 - the one thing that I love most about
07:44 - what games was going non-lethal and
07:46 - getting the bad guys to comply one of
07:48 - the ways to do that is to shoot them in
07:50 - the leg and sometimes they would comply
07:51 - after that however in a top-down
07:53 - perspective that's not really a
07:55 - possibility you can't really aim at
07:57 - different body parts so the issues with
08:00 - complex AI and the inability to target
08:02 - body parts caused me to reconsider the
08:04 - whole concept I still really like the
08:06 - top-down perspective so I wanted to keep
08:07 - that one of the unless flash games that
08:10 - I did that I really loved was Cobra team
08:12 - heart attack it was a top-down zombie
08:15 - shooter with lots of polish and lots of
08:16 - effects so that essentially made me
08:19 - think to switch from a SWAT game to a
08:20 - zombie game zombies have much simpler AI
08:23 - so that part would be solved and the
08:25 - characters would be completely
08:26 - controlled by the player without much
08:27 - need for some really complex ion so I
08:30 - got to work on that concept learning
08:32 - unity as I went along and six months
08:34 - later I had the very first version of
08:36 - what eventually became survivors work I
08:38 - still think it's a really great concept
08:40 - nowadays with controlling the survivors
08:42 - and making sure they are positioned in
08:43 - the right direction I really loved the
08:45 - field of view mechanic which by the way
08:47 - I did cover in a video on this channel
08:49 - but back then you also need the tons of
08:52 - votes in order to get through green one
08:53 - so when survivor squad was done the only
08:55 - place I could really sell it was still
08:57 - just on the website now the result of
08:59 - selling an obscure indie game in its own
09:01 - website is exactly as you would guess
09:03 - which is pretty close to zero copies
09:04 - that was quite a bummer I spent those
09:07 - six months giving it my own but suddenly
09:08 - I couldn't find the people that would
09:10 - enjoy the game but the greenlight page
09:12 - was still active and they were proving
09:14 - about a hundred games every two weeks so
09:16 - I started into math and realized that I
09:18 - would eventually get enough to get
09:20 - approved the people in the comments
09:22 - enjoy the concept and the game had a
09:24 - nice proportion of
09:25 - yes votes so I went back to work kept
09:27 - working and improving the game while the
09:29 - votes kept coming in every day
09:30 - eventually it was around October and
09:33 - when I finally got enough votes and the
09:35 - game was accepted onto steam I kept
09:37 - working on it and reading all the Steam
09:38 - documentation or to add the achievements
09:40 - and prepare the store page and
09:42 - everything else that was needed that was
09:44 - a ton of work and required me to learn a
09:46 - ton of these skills then finally in
09:48 - November 8 the game finally came out so
09:51 - the idea that sir nearly one year before
09:53 - finally came to pass I transitioned from
09:56 - making flash games with ads in order to
09:57 - making a premium steam game now
10:00 - thankfully the game actually sold quite
10:01 - well at launch especially when compared
10:03 - to my flash games which even when they
10:05 - are played by hundreds of thousands of
10:07 - people that's not really worth much
10:08 - money here with a couple of hundred
10:10 - copies I was already making a lot more
10:12 - than with any other flash game I had
10:14 - made for example my most successful
10:16 - flash game was game Corp it was played
10:19 - over 6 million times however that really
10:22 - only generated about a thousand dollars
10:23 - so robbery squad on the other hand made
10:26 - more than that on its first day on seam
10:27 - alone thanks to just selling a handful
10:29 - of copies back then Steam was still in
10:32 - transition so a lot of people were still
10:33 - very interested in every game that was
10:35 - coming out so a game which seemed to
10:37 - have some unique mechanics appeal to
10:39 - quite a bit of people however there was
10:42 - also a lot of criticism people thought
10:43 - the mechanics were unique but the
10:45 - execution wasn't like me in many places
10:46 - and that is very much accurate I managed
10:49 - to apply all of my knowledge at the time
10:50 - and build a full game but I still had a
10:52 - lot more to learn looking back I still
10:54 - very much like the mechanics but I think
10:56 - it's clearly made by someone
10:58 - inexperienced so since it's only one
11:00 - with lunch after thinking of what to do
11:02 - next I eventually decided on a sequel I
11:04 - still like the core mechanics and I
11:06 - wanted to improve everything in every
11:08 - way so I got to work on what eventually
11:10 - became survivor squad content I worked
11:13 - on it for a lot longer than survivor
11:14 - squad in total around 18 months and I
11:17 - even experimented with something new
11:18 - which was early access the game launched
11:21 - in early access and suddenly despite
11:23 - being better in every way it did not do
11:25 - well at all sales were about 10% of what
11:27 - several squads owned I was still
11:29 - committed to making the game great so
11:31 - during early access there were updates
11:33 - every single week for six months I was
11:35 - on there suddenly for every update that
11:37 - I made it wasn't like screaming
11:39 - to avoid despite my dedication and hard
11:41 - work I never really managed to get the
11:42 - word out I kept working on it hoping
11:44 - that if I just focus on making the game
11:46 - great you would eventually sell on the
11:48 - phone release however that was not the
11:51 - case before release came and not much
11:53 - really changed copy sold were still very
11:55 - near zero it really hurts me even now
11:58 - because I didn't love the game it has
11:59 - the same unique core mechanics of
12:01 - survivor squad once being better in
12:03 - every way I think the game as a whole is
12:05 - awesome and I think it's one with
12:06 - potential the map editor alone is like a
12:09 - programming language it has so many
12:11 - capabilities it's really insane I still
12:14 - will like the game to this day but
12:15 - suddenly I could not find enough people
12:17 - who share in that desire so this was my
12:20 - very first taste of a pre-series failing
12:22 - I worked like crazy for 18 months and
12:24 - result was almost nothing that is the
12:27 - danger of being an indie developer if
12:29 - you don't sound copies you don't make
12:30 - any money and suddenly you can't afford
12:32 - rent there's no inherent safety net no
12:34 - guaranteed minimum paycheck if he sound
12:36 - zero you get zero regardless of how many
12:38 - hours or how hard you worked
12:41 - thankfully I've always been pretty good
12:43 - with money so I didn't overspend when I
12:45 - found success with survivor squad which
12:47 - led me endure the financial failure that
12:48 - was gone once however I also certainly
12:51 - didn't have enough in order to handle
12:53 - another 18-month failure so after that I
12:56 - started to think really hard about what
12:57 - the next best approach would be the main
12:59 - limitation was time I couldn't afford
13:01 - even just one year but obviously I also
13:04 - didn't want to make any trash so I
13:06 - wanted the game that was short sweet and
13:08 - cheap in thinking about all the various
13:10 - options eventually I looked at my flash
13:12 - games and one of them had become
13:14 - massively successful over time game Corp
13:16 - I then had over six million place that's
13:18 - a very insane number however again most
13:21 - of those views came from a version that
13:23 - was onto a sponsor so on all those six
13:25 - millions plays that I made in other
13:27 - websites with ads amounted to a total of
13:29 - just under $1000 but the design of the
13:32 - game was very solid and a lot of people
13:34 - really liked it so it seemed like the
13:35 - perfect fit for something short and
13:37 - sweet I decided to remake game corpse to
13:40 - work as a full desktop PC game and add a
13:43 - bunch of improvements for a nice cheap
13:44 - price over three months I completely
13:47 - remade the game from scratch in unity
13:49 - and added a ton
13:50 - improvements and fixes thanks to all the
13:52 - comments on a flash version I decided to
13:54 - rename it to game Corp DX for the deluxe
13:57 - version since the quarter the game was
13:59 - mostly the same as the free version I
14:01 - knew I couldn't charge much so I came up
14:03 - with a price of just three dollars so
14:05 - it's more than free but it's the only
14:06 - very low amount based on how many people
14:09 - play the free flash version I was hoping
14:11 - there would be enough people who would
14:12 - be able to pay such a small amount and
14:14 - that would make the game profitable now
14:16 - thankfully I was actually right the core
14:18 - of the game was very solid and all of
14:20 - the improvements I made and the benefits
14:22 - of running it in unity instead of flash
14:23 - were very noticeable DM sold very well
14:26 - at launch and as a reviews kept being
14:28 - very positive it kept selling well for
14:30 - quite a while so this game that took
14:32 - roughly 3 months to make quickly became
14:34 - more profitable than countless which
14:36 - took 18 months to make again it still
14:39 - saddens me that confluence did so badly
14:41 - but that's what being an indie dev is
14:43 - all about sometimes you make it and
14:44 - sometimes you don't now despite the very
14:47 - low price on the game there were
14:48 - actually a bunch of negative reviews
14:50 - essentially saying that the game is
14:51 - great but don't buy it and play the free
14:54 - version instead these always struck me
14:56 - as very odd so here are some people
14:58 - saying they generally liked the game but
15:00 - also they want to make sure that
15:01 - developer doesn't get anything at all so
15:03 - that seems very odd to me but anyway
15:05 - it's not the topic for another time
15:07 - since game Corp did so well I thought
15:09 - afterwards I should stick with the same
15:11 - genre I didn't want to do something
15:12 - completely different and risk getting
15:14 - the set failure that ended up being
15:15 - Conklin's so I thought about what are
15:18 - the themes I could explore in detail in
15:19 - genre I explored a bunch of concepts and
15:22 - the one that I real landed on was some
15:24 - sort of medieval army supplier so you
15:26 - would get a contract saying we need a
15:28 - hundred wooden swords then he would
15:30 - build a Pure Land with factories and
15:31 - workers in order to make the swords and
15:33 - deliver them as I worked on it I found
15:35 - that the system I devised for building
15:37 - the final items was great and I kept its
15:39 - rating on as I went along it became
15:41 - clear that the indeed evil army supplier
15:43 - theme was being very limiting
15:44 - I could only design items that fit the
15:46 - Moon so swords shields armors and so on
15:49 - after working on it for quite a while I
15:51 - dropped that theme and just embrace the
15:53 - blueprints so now it would simply make
15:55 - these blueprints that they accessible
15:56 - items and create a complex item without
15:59 - the medieval theme I could then explore
16:01 - a lot more items the result of that
16:04 - typing and adapting to where the design
16:06 - worked eventually turn into print tycoon
16:08 - now in terms of sales the game did quite
16:10 - alright
16:11 - not bad around but certainly not a hit
16:13 - the game was extremely appealing to a
16:15 - very very specific audience does about
16:18 - it mostly really liked it but the
16:20 - concept screenshots and the trailer only
16:22 - attracted some very specific people so
16:24 - it was successful but only within its
16:26 - niche there were also several reviews
16:28 - regarding complexity so with regards to
16:30 - game Corp I got a bunch of reviews
16:32 - saying that the game was way too
16:33 - simplistic and any more depth and then
16:36 - with blueprint racoon I got lots of
16:38 - reviews saying it was way too complex I
16:39 - need to be a lot more simple so that
16:41 - really just goes to show you that you
16:43 - can never build the perfect game some
16:45 - people like more simple games some
16:46 - people like more complex games you have
16:48 - to accept that not everyone won't like
16:50 - your games because each person is
16:51 - looking for a different experience then
16:54 - after a blueprint tycoon came one of my
16:55 - most ambitious games with really
16:57 - interesting results with the success of
16:59 - game Corp and blueprint I [ __ ] cup
17:01 - eluded the fact that I don't really
17:02 - spend much money meant that I was
17:03 - feeling like I could attempt something a
17:05 - bit more risky I've never really played
17:07 - much on consoles as a kid most of my
17:09 - time was done on my computer the only
17:11 - console I had was a PlayStation so I
17:13 - never really had that connection that
17:14 - some people have specifically with
17:16 - consoles but still as a game developer
17:18 - the idea of having my games working on a
17:20 - professional console does sound very
17:22 - nice so when I was thinking of what to
17:24 - do next I started to really focus on
17:26 - making something that could eventually
17:28 - work on a console so that means making a
17:30 - game based on a gamepad which pretty
17:33 - much removes a Coon's as a possibility
17:34 - so the genre that makes most sense on a
17:37 - gamepad is action so I started
17:39 - prototyping some character movement but
17:41 - I didn't want to make just a simple
17:42 - action game I wanted it to be very fast
17:45 - that made me experience with various
17:46 - dashes which have me thinking about
17:48 - making some abilities then I also didn't
17:50 - just want a generic action game I knew I
17:52 - wanted something original to make the
17:54 - game stand out so that's when I started
17:56 - thinking about action mixed with
17:57 - strategy one of my favorite games is
18:00 - modern plate so that became my guiding
18:01 - idea make a game with nice and
18:04 - fast-paced action with dashes and skills
18:05 - plus the ability to rate castles and
18:07 - control your army that way it would be
18:10 - unique and fun controllable with a
18:11 - gamepad the end result of all that is
18:13 - hyper Knights
18:15 - now in terms of the result
18:16 - Hyper night was an interesting one in
18:18 - total development time it was around 14
18:21 - months and spent six months in early
18:23 - acces i also invested heavily into
18:25 - professional artwork in order to make
18:26 - the game really stand out so it took
18:29 - quite a while to make and i invested a
18:30 - pre large amount onto it in terms of
18:33 - reviews it was the best game that I've
18:34 - done the review score stayed above 90
18:36 - for a very long time however in terms of
18:39 - sales it was simply decent not terrible
18:41 - but not great given how much time I
18:44 - spent and how much money I invested the
18:45 - end result was just a very basic wage
18:47 - that really saddened me quite a bit I
18:49 - really liked the game and the reviews
18:51 - all seem to agree however despite that
18:53 - the sales never really came since those
18:55 - sales never came it caused me to again
18:56 - focus on what went wrong and how I can
18:58 - improve for the future so that idea of
19:01 - making a game and later porting it to
19:02 - consoles still hasn't come to pass I'd
19:05 - certainly like to but spending the time
19:06 - to focus on that potentially risky
19:08 - endeavor is really something I can't
19:10 - afford at the moment Harbor nights and
19:12 - it's somewhat family or despite being a
19:14 - great game is what caused me to really
19:15 - look long and hard at how steam works
19:17 - why is it that a game with positive
19:19 - reviews and low price doesn't seem to
19:21 - find an audience since then I've spent
19:23 - countless hours reading everything I can
19:25 - find regarding steam and in the game
19:27 - marketing analyzing games that make it
19:28 - and games that don't and through that
19:30 - I've managed to learn quite a ton I've
19:33 - made two videos covering what you should
19:34 - do before and after release on Steam in
19:37 - order to get the best chances for
19:38 - success so check those out if you're in
19:40 - the process of watching your own game or
19:42 - just want to know more about releasing
19:44 - unseen so I learned a ton and also did
19:47 - some experiments now one of the reasons
19:49 - why hopper Nights wasn't financially
19:50 - successful was just because of how much
19:52 - I spent on it both in time and money so
19:55 - my next game would be an experiment into
19:57 - code reusability and an interesting game
19:59 - with no marketing behind it the end
20:02 - result was hyper nice balance it's an
20:04 - interesting game it's clearly just an
20:06 - experiment it's more of a sandbox in a
20:08 - clearly-defined game it's great if
20:10 - you're a programmer and like building
20:11 - characters in AI but that's a very very
20:14 - small niche so with that game and
20:16 - learned that even if you manage to spend
20:17 - very little making the game if it's not
20:19 - well received and there's no marketing
20:21 - then you won't still fail to make a
20:23 - profit
20:23 - so with that in mind I started to focus
20:25 - really hard on what game could I make
20:27 - that would have an
20:29 - easy time with marketing also my most
20:31 - successful games were tycoons so I
20:33 - should stick with that a big part of
20:35 - marketing is really just having a very
20:37 - compelling concept now for a Tycoon game
20:39 - the theme is very integral to how it
20:41 - works now the reason you play a prison
20:44 - architect is because of the uniqueness
20:45 - of managing a prison unless you go for
20:48 - the more generic tycoons like building a
20:49 - city then there isn't much direct
20:51 - competition I obviously cannot hope to
20:53 - compete with Sim City or cities skylines
20:55 - so I have to go with the unique route
20:57 - and with that I came up with a very
21:00 - unique and interesting concept a tycoon
21:02 - with ninja account ninja Tycoon the name
21:05 - itself is already a lot more marketable
21:06 - than hyper Knights patterns and the
21:08 - concept sounds interesting and unique so
21:10 - that was part of the plan make it a
21:12 - unique and interesting concept and name
21:14 - part two is based on my research of
21:16 - steam and that wish lists and first week
21:18 - sales were very important so I started
21:20 - spreading the word as soon as I could
21:21 - in order to gather some wish list and
21:23 - part three of the plan was to make it
21:25 - short and sweet I didn't want to spend
21:27 - one year which would make it very much
21:29 - more difficult in order to be profitable
21:30 - without that the game launched and it
21:32 - was actually pretty nice success even
21:34 - how long in how little I spent on the
21:36 - wish list helped ensure a decent number
21:38 - of sales on the first week and it got a
21:40 - nicely through rate whenever the game
21:42 - showed up however the negative thing of
21:45 - spending such a small amount of time
21:46 - working on the game is that it is
21:48 - obviously very limited and very small
21:50 - the experience is great and interesting
21:52 - but it don't last for a couple of hours
21:54 - so what that really means that the
21:55 - experiment was a success
21:56 - I know understood better what makes a
21:58 - game sell and all I needed was to apply
22:00 - that to a game with a lot more content
22:02 - so once again I started prototyping some
22:04 - ideas and thinking heavenly about how
22:06 - marketable they were I wanted to stick
22:08 - with tycoon since that's the genre that
22:10 - I found most success in and one that is
22:12 - also very much appealing to a decently
22:14 - sized niche audience of the Steam
22:16 - audience as I worked on various
22:18 - prototype ideas I started playing around
22:19 - with the idea of Rinas and AI
22:21 - so essentially having some units fight
22:24 - each other at the same time I kept
22:26 - thinking about marketing barren ground
22:28 - games were a huge thing and they still
22:30 - are so when the prototype with the arena
22:32 - start to take shape it became quite
22:33 - clear I was going to make a tycoon game
22:36 - like roam across the tycoon but we
22:38 - shooting arenas and I was gonna
22:39 - battleground tycoon so I kept working on
22:42 - it and in December of 2018 after six
22:44 - months of development the game was
22:45 - released into early access again I
22:48 - focused on applying everything I've
22:49 - learned so I set up the coming soon page
22:51 - as soon as possible and start gathering
22:53 - wish lists the game had almost 10,000
22:56 - wish lists when launched and that home
22:57 - didn't have a nice healthy lunch then in
23:00 - several months in early access I did
23:02 - that ton of updates improved lots of
23:04 - areas and continued to work on it I've
23:06 - also done several videos covering
23:07 - systems from the game one of the reasons
23:10 - I started this channel was to make
23:11 - tutorials that had an actual practical
23:12 - application in Saturday's theory so in
23:15 - those videos I cover a pretty much the
23:17 - exact same code that I use on the game
23:18 - something really great you can do is go
23:21 - play the game on Steam see it all in
23:22 - action then come back here and check out
23:24 - videos to see how the underlying systems
23:26 - work then one September the game finally
23:29 - came out of early access and it has done
23:30 - quite well I covered all the stats in
23:33 - detail in another video so check the
23:35 - link in the description if you haven't
23:36 - seen it yet in there I cover how much
23:38 - game sold and how it went so if you're
23:41 - keeping count at home that was a ton of
23:43 - random games and random programming over
23:45 - my childhood which gave me a nice
23:46 - knowledge base then 35 flash games which
23:50 - gave me a lot of game dev learning
23:51 - experience but never really any serious
23:53 - income and then eight Steam games too
23:56 - that found hard three that did well and
23:59 - three that did great so as you can see
24:01 - this has been a very long journey with
24:02 - lots of ups and downs over many years
24:04 - overall I'm pleased with where I'm at
24:06 - right now and look forward to the future
24:08 - but always constantly I'm learning on
24:10 - how to do better this is a really tough
24:12 - business and in order to make it it
24:14 - takes a lot of hard work and a lot of
24:15 - persistence so if you want to follow
24:18 - along with this path then do keep that
24:19 - in mind by all means do follow your
24:21 - dream but be aware of what it takes to
24:23 - get there I made a video where I covered
24:25 - seven clear steps to become a game
24:27 - developer so check that out if you're
24:29 - looking for more specific practical
24:30 - advice this video took a really long
24:33 - time to make so if you can please hit
24:34 - the like button and share it with a
24:35 - friend you can also pick up the game
24:37 - panel on the website and play the games
