00:00 - hello and welcome I am your code monkey
00:01 - min this video we're going to take our
00:03 - simple character movement and add dodge
00:04 - rolling let's begin
00:08 - so this is our character I can move
00:11 - around using the keyboard and if I go up
00:13 - here as you can see he tests for a
00:15 - hitboxes so he does not go through walls
00:17 - and also if I press space I have the
00:20 - ability to do a dash that we had in the
00:22 - previous video it makes him move forward
00:24 - quickly and spawns a nice effect the
00:26 - dash also tests for wall so I cannot
00:28 - dash through the wall okay
00:30 - so now we want to make a nice dodge roll
00:32 - the main difference between the dodge
00:34 - roll and the - is that the dash is
00:36 - instant whereas the dodge roll is a
00:38 - slide so that requires us to animate the
00:40 - position over time so let's look at the
00:42 - code and here we have our simple setup
00:45 - on update we have our two functions
00:47 - being called testing for normal movement
00:49 - and also testing for D dash now we're
00:51 - going to add another function for
00:52 - handling the dodge roll so in here
00:54 - handle dodge roll the handle movement
00:57 - captures for a keyboard input and moves
00:59 - them around and the dash does the same
01:01 - thing handles for the space and
01:03 - instantiate the effect we also have two
01:05 - helper functions one to test if we can
01:07 - move which does a physics raycast to
01:09 - test if there is no collider towards
01:11 - that direction by that distance and they
01:13 - try move does the same thing whilst also
01:15 - testing for diagonal horizontal and
01:17 - vertical movement so here let's make a
01:19 - new function for the handle dodge roll
01:23 - so first let's capture the input for our
01:26 - dodge we're going to use the right mouse
01:28 - click so just for testing to see if we
01:32 - are correctly capturing the mouse click
01:33 - let's do a debug pop up I'm going to use
01:38 - ECM debug class to create a text pop up
01:41 - on the mouse position this last is part
01:43 - of the code monk utilities which you can
01:44 - grab for free from unity code monkey
01:46 - comm so in here let's just do a pop-up
01:48 - on the mouse position to say click so
01:51 - let's see so here I am moving around
01:53 - right click and yep there you go there's
01:55 - the pop-up so we are correctly capturing
01:57 - the mouse click ok so now back in the
01:59 - code since we want to make a slide
02:01 - instead of an instant movement that
02:02 - means we need to move the transform over
02:04 - several updates for that we're going to
02:06 - use some simple States so all the way up
02:09 - here let's define a private room for the
02:12 - state in here first we're going to have
02:14 - a very simple state so the normal state
02:17 - and then we're also going to have the
02:19 - dodge roll
02:20 - State and we store the state as a member
02:23 - variable by default we start off at safe
02:26 - normal and then on our update we do a
02:29 - simple switch on our state so case we
02:35 - are on the normal state we are doing the
02:37 - exact same thing as previously but if we
02:41 - are on case state the dodge roll sliding
02:44 - then we want to do something else so
02:47 - let's do a function to handle actually
02:49 - moving the transform so we're going to
02:51 - call this the handle Dodger on slide
02:55 - so in this function we're going to move
02:57 - the transform so just for testing let's
02:59 - simply move them towards e right so move
03:02 - the transform that position moving
03:04 - towards the right by a certain sliding
03:07 - speed so it's a fine here a fold for the
03:09 - sliding speed and multiplied by time
03:13 - times since we want this to be frame
03:15 - rate independent and appear on the
03:17 - handle dodge roll let's do dodge roll
03:19 - and we set the state to be state dodge
03:22 - roll sliding so we change the state when
03:25 - we hit the right mouse button and then
03:27 - on the update when we have this state it
03:29 - won't run this function which will move
03:30 - him towards the right on every frame so
03:32 - let's see if he is sliding to the right
03:34 - okay so here is the character moving
03:36 - around if I hit the right mouse button
03:37 - yep there you go he's sliding to the
03:39 - right okay great
03:40 - so now we need the actual direction
03:42 - we're going to slide towards in order to
03:44 - use that direction here it means we need
03:45 - to set it as a member variable so all
03:48 - the way up here let's make a private
03:50 - vector3 for this slide there and we're
03:53 - going to set that all the way down here
03:55 - on the handle dodge roll when we start
03:57 - dodj rolling we need to set the slide
03:59 - direction we're going to make him slide
04:01 - towards the mouse so define the solid
04:03 - direction as the mouse world position
04:05 - mine is this transform dot position so
04:10 - we have the slide direction towards the
04:12 - mouse and now in here on the handle
04:14 - dodge roll sliding instead of using this
04:16 - created vector we're going to use the
04:18 - slide direction so it's testing we
04:19 - should be able to see the character
04:21 - smiling towards the mouse position so
04:23 - here I am moving around five points the
04:24 - mouse in here and hit the right button
04:26 - if there you go he dashed towards the
04:28 - mouse okay
04:29 - so now obviously we don't want them to
04:32 - keep sliding forever so let's on
04:34 - in order to do that we're going to start
04:36 - off with a certain slide speed and then
04:38 - reduce that speed until it is near zero
04:40 - so all the way up here we're going to
04:42 - define another member variable this will
04:44 - be a private float for the slide speed
04:46 - just like with in direction we're going
04:49 - to define a slight speed when we
04:50 - actually start sliding so here let's set
04:53 - a certain amount so let's say 350 and
04:56 - now in here when we are handling the
04:57 - Dajjal sliding we're going to use the
04:59 - actual slide speed instead of this one
05:01 - to find in here and then we're going to
05:03 - reduce it by a certain amount so we're
05:05 - going to reduce this might spin well
05:07 - let's say itself multiplied by a certain
05:10 - number and time double time so this
05:13 - won't reduce our slide speed every frame
05:15 - until it very much near zero so in here
05:18 - we simply do an if the slight speed if
05:21 - it is under a low enough amount so let's
05:23 - test first four five then we should go
05:26 - back to the normal state so state equals
05:28 - state are normal and let's also do
05:31 - another pop-up just to see when this
05:32 - happens okay so that should do it so
05:35 - let's see a piece of here's the
05:37 - character I can move him around now the
05:38 - mouse is in here first the right mouse
05:40 - button and yep there you go he dodged
05:42 - and as you can see the state changing
05:44 - when I click yup dodge role when he
05:46 - slides in there and the speed is back to
05:48 - low he goes back to normal and again I
05:50 - can move I can sound - and everything
05:52 - else still works so slide and there you
05:55 - go No so dodge dodge dodge and I can
05:58 - keep dodging and yep just like that now
06:01 - we are currently moving the transform so
06:03 - again like with all the others we are
06:04 - currently not testing for hitboxes so
06:06 - let's deal with that so here when we are
06:09 - moving instead of moving and using this
06:11 - function we can use this nice try move
06:13 - function that we made previously so in
06:15 - here we simply do a try move towards the
06:17 - slide ear we move them by slight speed
06:20 - multiplied by time lay down time okay
06:23 - here I am and if I slide towards the
06:25 - wall if there yo I don't go through the
06:27 - wall he slides and then he moves along
06:29 - the wall okay great now the only thing
06:31 - missing is the actual roll animation so
06:34 - let's add that I have the animation here
06:36 - in the base class alongside the walking
06:38 - and idle animations so in here when we
06:40 - start the dodge roll all we need to do
06:43 - is go into the player character base
06:45 - play the dodge animation towards the
06:48 - slide dear okay so let's see okay here I
06:52 - am move around and I dodge and you up
06:54 - there yo we got the nice dodge roll
06:55 - animation we got the slide movement and
06:58 - again we can also go through walls and
07:00 - yep everything is moving the states are
07:02 - changing and everything works great so
07:06 - there you have it we have the simple
07:07 - dodge roll the ability to be able to
07:09 - move our character away from attacks the
07:11 - code is set up in a simple way and all
07:13 - the other code we wrote previously is
07:14 - still working along with the new Dodge
07:16 - row as always you can download the
07:18 - project files in utilities from unity
07:20 - called monkey comm if you have any
07:21 - questions post them in the comments and
07:23 - I'll do my best answer them subscribe
07:24 - for more videos and I'll see you next
07:26 - time
