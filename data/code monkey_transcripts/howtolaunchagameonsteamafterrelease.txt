00:00 - in this video I'm going to go over what
00:02 - you should do right after releasing your
00:03 - game on Steam I'll go over the various
00:06 - tasks I do the second game is that in
00:08 - order to increase the chances of success
00:09 - this is my general to-do list that I
00:11 - have crafted over my 8 same releases
00:13 - let's begin
00:17 - [Music]
00:21 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:24 - and this channel is all about helping
00:25 - you learn how to make your own games
00:27 - with NF tutorials made by a professional
00:28 - indie game developer so if you find the
00:30 - video helpful consider subscribing so
00:32 - first of all this phone was the previous
00:34 - video where I covered my to-do list for
00:36 - preparing a game to release on Steam if
00:38 - you haven't seen it yet go check the
00:40 - link in the description and then come
00:41 - back you that video covers what should
00:43 - be done before clicking the release
00:45 - button and now in this video we're going
00:47 - to look at what should be done right
00:48 - after you click the button so you press
00:50 - the button and your game is now live
00:52 - congratulations you have a game on Steam
00:54 - awesome however as a sole developer you
00:57 - have to keep your celebration very brief
00:59 - the second game is out there's a ton of
01:01 - work to do the first thing you need to
01:03 - do is let people know the game is now
01:05 - available start off by making a steam
01:07 - announcement players who are really
01:09 - looking forward to your game won't click
01:11 - the follow button and everyone who
01:13 - follows your game won't get a pop up in
01:15 - their Steam client you can't just make
01:17 - the announcement in the game page which
01:18 - will work however if you found my
01:20 - pre-release to-do list then you will
01:22 - have created a developer page in that
01:25 - page you can post announcements and
01:26 - automatically publish them to your game
01:28 - this is very useful once you have
01:30 - several games on themes since you can
01:32 - notify all of them about your new game
01:34 - release also the players who added the
01:36 - game to their wish list will get an
01:38 - email saying the game has just been
01:39 - released so you can see why every
01:42 - developer myself included wants you to
01:44 - add their games to your wish list and
01:45 - phone doing so greatly improves your
01:47 - chances of finding success with the game
01:50 - out and available for purchase now is a
01:52 - great time to make the trailer live on
01:54 - YouTube whether this has an impact or
01:56 - not will greatly depend on how much
01:58 - reach you have in your channel for me
02:01 - for example I have quite a nice amount
02:02 - of reach on this channel but almost
02:04 - nothing on my developer channel so for
02:06 - me the developer channel is solely for
02:08 - archival purposes rather than marketing
02:10 - but if your developer channel is big
02:13 - enough then publishing the trailer on
02:15 - YouTube and all your social media can be
02:16 - quite powerful
02:17 - either way I make it public on YouTube
02:20 - so you can start to share travel to
02:21 - people outside of caen then post about
02:24 - the launch on Facebook and Twitter
02:26 - again this role depends on the size of
02:28 - your following just make a simple
02:30 - message saying the game is out
02:31 - and include the trailer link if you have
02:34 - a large following or just get lucky and
02:36 - go viral this can be very impactful if
02:38 - not then you have nice archive of your
02:40 - releases pin the message and keep
02:42 - following the to-do list key Mandler is
02:45 - a great way to send keys directly to
02:47 - youtubers and twitch streamers this is
02:50 - not a sponsored shout out I just really
02:51 - like their service and find it very
02:53 - useful there are always new youtubers
02:55 - coming up so keeping an updated list is
02:57 - very difficult
02:58 - instead here you just see the list the
03:01 - stats of that influencer and decide
03:03 - whether or not to send them a steam key
03:04 - this is a very easy way to send your
03:07 - game to people who might be interested
03:08 - in playing it however I do remember the
03:11 - general issues with sending out keys
03:13 - some of the people who asked for keys
03:14 - have no intention of reviewing or doing
03:17 - a video they just want to put the key up
03:19 - for sale and make a quick buck so
03:21 - instead of sending to every single
03:22 - person who requests the key
03:24 - make sure you setup a certain minimum
03:26 - like for example only send to people who
03:28 - have more than 10 thousand subscribers
03:29 - how much you want to risk your keys
03:31 - ending up on third-party sites is up to
03:33 - you but regardless make sure you contact
03:36 - as many valid youtubers and twitch
03:38 - streamers as you can if your game
03:41 - becomes popular on YouTube or twitch
03:42 - that can seriously boost your sales
03:44 - nowadays it seems influencers are all
03:47 - that matters but traditional press still
03:49 - has an impact so go out and create your
03:51 - own list of press that covers games like
03:53 - yours for PC games the main one that
03:55 - covers quite a wide range of games is
03:57 - rock paper shopping once you have your
04:00 - list send out the emails with the keys
04:01 - make sure you include a very short
04:04 - description of your game like the one in
04:05 - the store page as well as in a link to
04:07 - the trailer look at other indie dev
04:09 - press releases to get an idea of how
04:11 - yours should look it is very difficult
04:13 - to get pressed right about your game but
04:15 - if you do make it it might help you
04:17 - reach quite a bit so at this point
04:19 - you've contacted youtubers and the
04:21 - general press now it's time to contact
04:24 - your biggest fans if you have them if
04:25 - you made a website for your game as soon
04:28 - as you announce you hopefully also added
04:30 - a signup form for people to join your
04:32 - mailing list also you can add a form in
04:35 - game to let people sign up from the
04:36 - inside if this is your first game then
04:39 - chances are your own list is going to be
04:40 - quite small but as you make more games
04:42 - your own list won't continue
04:44 - which will help you in the future so
04:45 - regardless of what size it is send email
04:48 - to those people it can be similar to the
04:50 - press email except targeted towards your
04:52 - biggest fans let them know the game is
04:54 - out and include a call to action to buy
04:56 - your game emails are possibly the most
04:58 - powerful form of marketing but also the
05:00 - most difficult if you can get your
05:02 - biggest fans to buy your game at launch
05:04 - then that increases visibility in the
05:06 - store which in turn increases sales and
05:08 - so on so your goal as a career in indie
05:11 - game development should be to make games
05:12 - that these people love the more fans you
05:14 - have the easier it is to stay afloat in
05:16 - game development in your steam dashboard
05:19 - you won't find a place where you can
05:21 - directly connect with steam curators
05:22 - this is yet another great way to contact
05:25 - influencers and have them play your game
05:27 - the main benefit of this system is it
05:30 - sends the game directly to their account
05:31 - rather than a steam key so you don't
05:34 - have to worry about your keys ending up
05:35 - on the black market
05:36 - you have a hundred curator copies you
05:38 - can give out this is not a very large
05:40 - amount so don't just send to every
05:42 - single person instead look for reviewers
05:44 - who match up with your game genre for
05:46 - example there's no point in wasting a
05:48 - curator copy sending it to someone who
05:49 - only reviews visual novels if you have
05:51 - an action game also you might get
05:54 - curators emailing you asking for a copy
05:56 - get there a curator named and put it in
05:58 - search bar to find them as soon as the
06:00 - game is out and people are playing
06:01 - you'll start to get some reviews make
06:03 - sure you read them to see if there's any
06:05 - hidden game breaking bugs that someone
06:07 - has found or simply issues that can
06:09 - easily be fixed remember steam updates
06:11 - are free so if someone reports above try
06:14 - to fix it quickly and publish the update
06:15 - also make sure you reply to reviews to
06:18 - either get more information from person
06:20 - or clarify some misinformation
06:22 - especially on negative reviews but
06:25 - remember that your reply is the official
06:27 - developer reply so make sure you conduct
06:30 - yourself in a professional manner hidden
06:32 - in the negative reviews are the nuggets
06:34 - that improve the game and you as a game
06:35 - developer so always been looking for
06:37 - those then one specifics for early
06:40 - access games if your game has been out
06:42 - for a while then you won't have received
06:44 - reviews during early
06:45 - some of those people might have enjoyed
06:47 - the game but just thought it was a bit
06:48 - too early so if you're going for a full
06:51 - release out of early access make sure
06:53 - you reply to those old reviews letting
06:55 - them know that the game has been
06:56 - significantly improved and is now fully
06:58 - released hopefully some of those won't
07:01 - try the game out again and hopefully all
07:02 - the issues the head of the game have
07:04 - been fixed or improved so hopefully you
07:06 - might be able to change some negative
07:08 - reviews into positive ones which will
07:10 - greatly affect your score sometimes the
07:12 - people who find bugs won't reply to your
07:14 - requests for their lives or save files
07:16 - which can make it very difficult to fix
07:18 - whatever issue they found however if you
07:21 - follow D before launch don't list then
07:23 - you will have implemented come out
07:24 - Diagnostics so head over to your unity
07:27 - dashboard and check out what errors are
07:29 - being reported with that error list and
07:31 - the feedback from your players you may
07:33 - be able to deduce what went wrong and
07:35 - even if you can't directly replicate an
07:37 - error try to add some safeguards to make
07:39 - sure everything so works even if the
07:41 - error still occurs for example one of
07:44 - the errors on battleground tycoon was a
07:46 - health bar that for some reason was
07:48 - being set to no I've never encountered
07:49 - that error the reference was always
07:51 - being set correctly in the constructor
07:53 - so in the function that was thrown in
07:55 - there I just had the simple if to test
07:57 - for not obviously locating the actual
08:00 - underlying bug and fixing it is the best
08:02 - approach but if that can't be done then
08:04 - just make sure it doesn't actually break
08:06 - the game if you implemented the workshop
08:08 - then you should have also implemented a
08:10 - little widget to grab items from a
08:12 - collection now that the game is out you
08:14 - should pay attention to the workshop and
08:16 - how like new items that players make
08:17 - here is the workshop highlight being
08:20 - used in my game as you can see it
08:22 - rotates through all the elements in a
08:23 - collection and the collection is this
08:25 - one so in order to highlight certain
08:27 - point or made items all I need to do is
08:29 - add it to the collection enter
08:30 - problematically gets updated in game so
08:33 - if you did a similar implementation
08:34 - remember to update this collection as
08:36 - players create more items there are a
08:39 - lot of other stores where people also
08:41 - buy games while they don't have the size
08:43 - of steam you should definitely not
08:45 - ignore them as an indie dev you need to
08:47 - spread out as much as possible the top
08:49 - ones are humble and Eugene for humble
08:52 - you can submit your game to the store
08:54 - and pre easily get
08:55 - there the hummus or has a great
08:57 - dashboard where you can easily
08:58 - participate in weekly sales which helped
09:00 - quite a bit
09:01 - and you can also use their widget to
09:03 - sell your game directly on the games
09:04 - website their widget is what I'm using
09:07 - on the code monkey website to sell the
09:09 - game bundle then you also have gog which
09:12 - is also pretty big but more curated so
09:14 - go ahead and submit your game and maybe
09:16 - only accept yugi also requires the game
09:19 - to be drm free so in case you do get
09:22 - accepted
09:22 - make sure it's simple to remove your
09:24 - Steam integration and then you have on
09:26 - the other stores like Green Man gaming
09:27 - fanatic on new vine H GamersGate in Egon
09:32 - and more again as an indie developer you
09:35 - should put your game wherever possible
09:36 - in order to increase your reach and your
09:38 - chances of success so that's the general
09:42 - to-do list that I follow after
09:43 - publishing a game on Steam first let
09:45 - your biggest fans know the game is out
09:47 - through these team announcements then
09:49 - launch the trailer on YouTube post about
09:51 - the release one with the trailer link on
09:53 - Facebook and Twitter send keys to
09:56 - influencers through chemo email the
09:58 - general press send out a release
10:01 - newsletter to your mailing list use
10:04 - curator connect to send copies to
10:05 - matching steam curators read reviews as
10:08 - they're posted and analyze what is
10:10 - incorrect and what can be improved if
10:12 - your game was in early access contact
10:14 - old reviewers and let them know of the
10:16 - full release monitor the cloud
10:19 - Diagnostics dashboard and attempt to fix
10:21 - errors even before their reporting how
10:23 - ID cool items players have created in
10:25 - the workshop and contact other stores to
10:28 - spread your game as much as possible if
10:30 - you do all this then your chances of
10:32 - success will be much greater I wish you
10:34 - the best of luck with your game release
10:36 - if you liked the video subscribe the
10:38 - channel for more game they have videos
10:40 - and unity tutorials post any questions
10:43 - you have in the comments and I'll see
