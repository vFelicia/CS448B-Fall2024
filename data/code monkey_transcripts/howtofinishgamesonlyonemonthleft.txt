00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your kudmaki and
00:02 - I've got one month left to finish my
00:04 - game that's one month to take this and
00:06 - turn into a complete polish game so
00:08 - here's all the tasks that I need to do
00:09 - in this time as well as my advice to you
00:10 - for how to finish your games they're
00:12 - only say they set to October 2nd that's
00:14 - going to be the first Monday of October
00:15 - my main advice to you when choosing a
00:17 - launch date for a game is to look at
00:19 - what festivals and sales are going to
00:20 - happen and when you absolutely do not
00:22 - want to launch during a festival or
00:24 - Steam Sale doing that will absolutely
00:25 - kill your game so don't do that so for
00:28 - me date that I picked was for Once Upon
00:29 - reason the next team Festival that is
00:31 - going to happen on the week after that
00:32 - then in mid-october over there you've
00:35 - got Halloween then you've got like
00:37 - Friday then Christmas and New Year and
00:38 - so on so given that for me my goal is to
00:40 - launch a game this year the latest that
00:42 - I can launch is pretty much just that
00:43 - one week so unless something really
00:45 - serious happens something really drastic
00:47 - then that date is probably going to be
00:48 - the date when the game will launch which
00:50 - of course means that the game needs to
00:51 - be done by then with that in mind here's
00:53 - my quick advice to you on how to finish
00:55 - games and my advice is simply just to
00:57 - find an MVP that's a minimum viable
00:59 - product so basically just cut down
01:00 - everything for your game to the absolute
01:02 - Bare Essentials just figure out the
01:04 - absolute minimum thing that fully works
01:06 - as a complete game and focus on doing
01:07 - just that importantly is make sure you
01:09 - do that way before your targeted release
01:11 - date The reason for that is because you
01:13 - want to leave some time for doing
01:14 - nothing but polish it is much much
01:17 - better to have a smaller but highly
01:19 - polished game as opposed to a huge game
01:21 - with tons of content but all of it is
01:22 - very unpublished so for me lately I've
01:24 - been working towards getting that mvp
01:26 - done I actually wanted to get it done by
01:28 - the end of August but of course as
01:30 - always with everything everything takes
01:31 - longer than expected there are three
01:33 - massive tasks that still need to be done
01:35 - in order to make the game complete the
01:36 - first one is the interplay internal
01:38 - Logistics this is what I've been working
01:39 - on for the past few days basically the
01:41 - ability for the player to colonize
01:42 - another planet then being able to set up
01:44 - resource chains and transport resources
01:46 - between the planets then the second
01:48 - massive task this one is commonly
01:49 - reworking the defense mechanics right
01:51 - now the zombies are only extremely basic
01:53 - they just spawn randomly they move
01:55 - towards the dinky and they do an attack
01:56 - I need to rework all of this I'm going
01:59 - to make some fix small points I'm going
02:01 - to set up some wave spawning set up a
02:02 - day night cycle I'm going to set up
02:04 - different zoombies that require a
02:06 - different ammo to kill and so on and of
02:07 - course I'm going to need to make it on
02:09 - work both in the real world and the off
02:11 - world the going was for the player to
02:13 - set up on defenses so that when they're
02:15 - in one world they don't have to worry
02:16 - about the other world and finally the
02:18 - last task is making the intro Mission
02:19 - basically I want the game to start on
02:21 - some kind of spaceship which will teach
02:23 - the player the basic controls as well as
02:25 - work as a sort of mini story now for me
02:27 - I'm definitely not a writer but still it
02:28 - helps to have some kind of basic story
02:30 - to guide the player the players are
02:31 - going to start off in the spaceship
02:33 - learn some basic controls then basically
02:35 - the spaceship is going to crash on the
02:36 - first planet and that's how the game
02:38 - starts probably I think making that
02:39 - little mini intro Mission I think that
02:41 - is going to add some nice structures to
02:42 - the game so those are the three massive
02:44 - tasks that I need to do in order to get
02:46 - the game to a complete state but then
02:47 - after that like I said comes the time
02:49 - for polishing I really need to get those
02:51 - tasks done as soon as possible so I have
02:53 - plenty of time to publish and that's not
02:54 - just visual polish it is also adding all
02:57 - the random features that a complete Game
02:58 - must have for example I want the game to
03:00 - be fully playable with the controller
03:01 - that is something I still need to add
03:03 - with that done then I will also test the
03:05 - game on the sim deck to make sure it
03:06 - also works on there it should be pretty
03:08 - simple once the controller support is
03:09 - already implemented another important
03:11 - thing is localization my advice to you
03:13 - is do not ignore that same is indeed
03:15 - massive but the English audience is
03:17 - actually just a small portion of it so
03:19 - if you just make your game in English
03:20 - you are actually ignoring a huge amount
03:22 - of people that could enjoy your game
03:23 - then the music and sound effects right
03:26 - now it's all super basic pretty much
03:27 - only button sound effects just a single
03:29 - song I definitely need to add a ton more
03:31 - on that and then of course adding in
03:33 - lots of visual polish I've already had a
03:35 - bunch of animations in the last few
03:36 - updates but everything is still a bit
03:38 - way too static I want to add lots of
03:40 - movement to the entire game make it all
03:41 - feel a bunch more alive then making
03:43 - multiplayer work personally is also very
03:45 - important again the game is meant to
03:46 - work both in single player and
03:47 - multiplayer right now the multiplayer
03:49 - isn't working in technical terms but
03:52 - there are a lot of visual effects that
03:53 - the Lions just don't see so I definitely
03:55 - need to fix that then also need to
03:56 - publish in lobby scene right now it's
03:58 - actually still in the exact same same
04:00 - super basic one that I initially made in
04:01 - my free multiplayer course I just copy
04:04 - pasted that entire scene back into this
04:05 - game after that I would also like to add
04:07 - the various theme features so that's
04:09 - adding some achievements trading cards
04:11 - Simplot save possibly adding modding
04:13 - support to the workshop and a bunch more
04:14 - I'm also going to need to make a brand
04:16 - new trailer now for this one I should
04:18 - probably make that one quickly a good
04:20 - trailer held together wish list quite a
04:22 - lot so my advice to you is definitely
04:23 - make sure your trailer and your Capstone
04:25 - both aren't as good as possible and when
04:27 - all of that is done basically I'm going
04:28 - to need to constantly play test the game
04:30 - and balance all the numbers and before
04:32 - release I also want to make a massive
04:33 - updated demo and basically ask all of
04:35 - you to play the game and give me your
04:36 - feedback ideally that should help make
04:38 - sure that the launch version when the
04:40 - game finally comes out that one is as
04:41 - awesome as I can make it and as bug free
04:43 - as possible so I'm looking at this whole
04:44 - list I must say I'm quite a bit stressed
04:46 - right now there's certainly a ton of
04:48 - work to do personally I know that I can
04:50 - be extremely productive when I put my
04:52 - mind to it so in 30 days I do know that
04:54 - I can make a mess amount of stuff for
04:56 - example the interplanetary system that
04:57 - one has been really complex to implement
04:59 - it involved tens of scripts thousands of
05:01 - lines of code it's insanely complex but
05:04 - I didn't manage to get it on working in
05:05 - about a week so looking at that what I
05:08 - can do in 30 days that is quite a nice
05:10 - amount of time but still that is quite a
05:12 - lot of work I really want to make sure
05:13 - that the final game is as excellent as I
05:15 - can make it then in terms of expected
05:17 - results right now the wish list numbers
05:19 - are a bit lower than I would like it
05:20 - doesn't look like it's going to hit the
05:22 - 5K minimum actually the other day
05:24 - someone asked me if it helps when
05:25 - someone has a game to their wish list
05:26 - even if they're not going to buy the
05:28 - game like I said here the answer is yup
05:30 - it does help the most important thing on
05:32 - Steam is just the wrong number of wish
05:33 - lists so a higher amount only to more
05:35 - visibility as the game comes out then
05:37 - after that initial surge steam is going
05:39 - to check the conversion rate and
05:40 - basically if wishlist and just regular
05:42 - sales if the game sold well then it's
05:44 - going to keep promoting the game if not
05:46 - then it's going to basically stop so if
05:48 - someone wishlist but then doesn't buy
05:49 - the game that actually still helps the
05:51 - initial surge even if it doesn't help
05:52 - afterwards but again my hope is that the
05:54 - game is actually good so that if the
05:56 - game gets some visibility from seeing
05:58 - right in the very beginning then then
06:00 - people who have never heard about the
06:01 - game they won't try it out they won't
06:03 - buy it and hopefully enjoy it so that
06:05 - said go ahead and add game to your
06:06 - wishlist if you haven't already now I
06:08 - probably won't hit that 5K minimum
06:09 - however at the same time the goal with
06:11 - this project really isn't massive sales
06:12 - success so I'm okay with that my number
06:14 - one goal when I started this project
06:15 - back in March was simply I want to make
06:17 - a game this year it has been four years
06:19 - since my very last team game which is
06:21 - way too long so for me just completing
06:23 - this project I'm going to consider that
06:24 - a huge success I'm going to keep trying
06:26 - to make regular videos trying to mention
06:28 - the game as much as possible together as
06:29 - many wishlist as I can before the
06:31 - release but the main priority is we're
06:32 - only just making an excellent game even
06:34 - if the sales numbers do end up being low
06:36 - I still really want to make sure that
06:37 - everyone who does play the game has a
06:39 - great time and of course in this channel
06:41 - I also want to really practice what I
06:42 - preach that's another reason why I
06:44 - decided to make this game I want to make
06:46 - sure that when you watch my videos when
06:47 - you follow my tutorials you know that
06:49 - what I'm teaching here comes from actual
06:50 - real world experience so with that I
06:52 - hope you've enjoyed following this
06:54 - journey I hope with these Devils I hope
06:56 - that by hearing my thoughts on these
06:57 - topics I hope it has helped you with
06:58 - your own games with that said now I've
07:00 - got to get back to work so thank you so
07:02 - much for watching and I'll see you next
07:03 - time
