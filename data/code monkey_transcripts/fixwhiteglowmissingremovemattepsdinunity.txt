00:00 - in this video we're going to learn how
00:01 - to fix the missing PSD remove math
00:03 - option when importing Photoshop files
00:05 - we're going to learn why sprites have a
00:08 - white glow and the various ways we can
00:09 - solve it let's begin
00:13 - [Music]
00:18 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:20 - and this channel is all about helping
00:22 - you learn how to make your own games
00:23 - with enough tutorials made by a
00:25 - professional indie game developer so if
00:27 - you find the video helpful consider
00:28 - subscribing so this is a pretty quick
00:30 - video about a really frustrating change
00:32 - in unity and I hope this helped someone
00:34 - out recently unity start adding this
00:37 - message to imported PSD files
00:39 - PSD Zara Photoshop files it says that
00:42 - this option has been deprecated and will
00:44 - probably be removed now for me I
00:47 - normally use PS DS while I'm making my
00:49 - game since I can just open Photoshop
00:50 - modify textures save it and it's
00:52 - automatically updated it's very simple
00:55 - and very quick and works fine since
00:57 - unity automatically creates the alpha
00:59 - Channel however it seems on one of the
01:01 - 2018 versions they did remove it with
01:04 - regards to newly added funds so this
01:06 - file in here was present before the
01:08 - change and as you can see still has the
01:10 - remove map option however this file in
01:13 - here was added after that version and as
01:15 - you can see that option is nowhere to be
01:17 - seen
01:18 - this is pretty terrible because without
01:20 - it as you can see the sprite looks all
01:22 - messed up so let's drag it in here and
01:24 - there you go you see that white color
01:25 - that's exactly what happens whereas on
01:27 - the Apple texture in here it's perfect
01:29 - without a white cloud essentially this
01:33 - is an issue with the Alpha Channel that
01:34 - that option automatically creates so you
01:37 - have three ways to fix this issue now
01:40 - number one you can manually add the
01:42 - option back so for that we can open the
01:45 - textures folder here it is my project
01:48 - files textures folder as you can see I
01:49 - have the Apple PSD medkit PSD and each
01:52 - one has its own meta file you can open
01:55 - the meta file with any text editor you
01:57 - have this is all the information that
02:00 - unity uses with regards to this file and
02:03 - if you scroll down into the bottom here
02:06 - you can see these two options PSE remove
02:08 - math and show remove math option we can
02:11 - manually save this into one save the
02:14 - file close it and now if we go back into
02:16 - unity as you can see the white color
02:19 - disappeared and the option is now in
02:21 - there so this is great and it works but
02:24 - since they say in here that it is
02:26 - deprecated I have no idea how long this
02:28 - fix will work so let's look at up
02:31 - number two you can still keep using PS
02:33 - DS but you must create an alpha Channel
02:36 - so here is that texture opened in
02:38 - Photoshop so I can add a new layer let's
02:42 - paint it in black now select this layer
02:46 - so it's unlike all the pictures that
02:48 - have color now go up here into select
02:52 - and save selection and name this the
02:55 - Alpha Channel here in the channels as
02:57 - you can see it now has an alpha Channel
02:59 - which contains our texture now we save
03:03 - this and if we go back into unity you
03:05 - can see that it's not using the unity
03:07 - option to remove the matte and it no
03:09 - longer has the glow so again the issue
03:12 - with the glow is always because of the
03:13 - alpha Channel
03:15 - so if your texture is very simple just
03:17 - like this and you only have one layer
03:19 - then this is quite simple however every
03:22 - time you modify your texture and let's
03:23 - say I wanted to add a simple pixel in
03:26 - here on the side if I want this to show
03:29 - up I can save it go back in here and as
03:32 - you can see it doesn't show because the
03:34 - Alpha Channel needs to be updated so
03:35 - once again you gotta come in here save
03:37 - again a new Alpha Channel don't like the
03:40 - old one and I go and now it does update
03:44 - the texture so as you can see it's very
03:47 - much Boreas to work without that helpful
03:49 - unity feature and the more layers you
03:51 - have the more complicated this process
03:53 - gets you need to duplicate merge layers
03:55 - and save the Alpha Channel now I'm not a
03:57 - Photoshop expert so I could be missing
03:59 - something here so if you know what an
04:01 - easier way to upload an alpha Channel in
04:02 - a file with lots of layers please let me
04:04 - know so that's your second option to
04:07 - manually create the Alpha Channel now
04:10 - for option number three you can simply
04:12 - use PNG s in here if I remove the Alpha
04:15 - Channel and also remove the black
04:17 - background and I save it as a PNG here
04:20 - is my medkit PNG here is the medkit PSD
04:25 - and the PNG in here and if I drag the
04:27 - PNG as you can see there's no white glow
04:29 - and it works perfectly fine whereas for
04:32 - the PSD say without a background as you
04:34 - can see there's the white glow back
04:36 - again now the big issue with this method
04:39 - is that every time you want to modify
04:40 - something you would need to go into
04:42 - Photoshop in here and modify your text
04:44 - and then save it again as a PNG and then
04:46 - it would update in here that also means
04:49 - that all of your textures won't be
04:51 - duplicated with one PNG and one PSD so
04:55 - these are three options you have for the
04:56 - only way the entities we're decision to
04:58 - remove this feature I really hope they
05:00 - don't completely remove it since there
05:02 - doesn't seem to be any benefit
05:03 - whatsoever I usually keep my texture as
05:06 - always as PSD is while I'm developing my
05:08 - game so this change is pretty bad and
05:10 - quite disruptive to my workflow if they
05:12 - completely remove this feature it won't
05:14 - force me to manually create alpha
05:15 - channels or render everything in PNG s
05:17 - either option will add unnecessary
05:20 - complexity to my workflow so I really
05:22 - hope they don't completely remove it in
05:24 - 2019 anyways I hope this helps out
05:27 - someone if you're missing the option or
05:29 - your sprites have white clothes now you
05:31 - know why that is and what you can do
05:32 - about if you have any questions post
05:35 - them in the comments and I'll do my best
05:36 - answer them subscribe for more videos
05:38 - and I'll see you next time
