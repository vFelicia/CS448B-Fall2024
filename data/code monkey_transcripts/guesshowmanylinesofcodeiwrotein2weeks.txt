00:00 - guess how many lines of code I wrote in
00:02 - the past few weeks in order to make this
00:03 - demo for my game so how many do you
00:05 - think I wrote in total how many per day
00:06 - honestly with all of this I even
00:08 - impressed myself the amount of mechanics
00:10 - and systems that I built in these two
00:11 - weeks is really insane I have the power
00:13 - system a research stream I also made
00:15 - some dinky orders multiple unique
00:17 - machines tons of UI work and tons of ux
00:19 - improvements and of course I can only
00:21 - add multiplayer which was a pretty big
00:23 - task so compared to what the game was
00:24 - before this printer difference really is
00:26 - night and day so did you take your guess
00:28 - well here's the answer it is sixteen
00:31 - thousand two hundred and seventy nine
00:33 - that's a huge amount that equals about a
00:35 - thousand lines of code per day like I
00:37 - said I'm impressed that I managed to do
00:38 - so much so quickly if you want to try it
00:41 - out you can go play the free demon team
00:42 - right now to see what I've done
