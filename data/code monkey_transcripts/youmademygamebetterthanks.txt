00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - here's just a quick video just to say
00:03 - thank you all for all of your excellent
00:05 - feedback on my game demo I've read so
00:07 - many awesome comments and made so many
00:08 - great changes I've been constantly
00:10 - updating the demo thanks to all of your
00:11 - comments sometimes even pushing two
00:13 - updates per day everything from simple
00:14 - things that I forgot like adding a
00:16 - visual for the version or pausing the
00:18 - game while on the menu as well as plenty
00:20 - of excellent suggested improvements like
00:21 - putting the buildings back into capsules
00:23 - to enable moving them I added a visual
00:25 - indicator to show the contents of the
00:27 - online crate containers I made the
00:29 - Buildings autostarty Construction action
00:31 - and other repeat the research action I
00:33 - had a simple visual to easily see which
00:35 - link is there idle I made the mines jump
00:38 - off before chasing the Target in order
00:40 - to prevent them getting stuck I added
00:41 - some flashing icons to make the tutorial
00:43 - a bit more straightforward I also added
00:45 - lots of tool tips and all kinds of
00:46 - buttons to make things more clear and
00:48 - tons more improvements all of these
00:50 - awesome additions make the game much
00:51 - better and they all came from your
00:52 - feedback so thanks again I also managed
00:54 - to fix tons of bugs thanks to your
00:56 - reports there was one that completely
00:58 - broke everything if the dinky died on be
01:00 - held it never happened to me during
01:01 - development so I never noticed it this
01:04 - is a nice practical example of why
01:05 - testing with actual people is so
01:07 - important everyone plays games in
01:08 - different ways another example is all of
01:11 - the various roles for the buildings
01:12 - since I made them I know the rules
01:14 - myself but a new player won't
01:15 - necessarily know that for example the
01:17 - purple crystals those need a fracking
01:19 - machine in order to spawn the resource
01:21 - nodes together so my advice to you is
01:23 - definitely make sure you get other
01:24 - people to play your games not just
01:25 - yourself that's super important and also
01:27 - speaking to you as an instructor I would
01:29 - highly recommend you add Cloud diagnosis
01:30 - your game this is an excellent Unity
01:32 - tool that has been very useful to
01:34 - essentially prevent and fix bugs without
01:36 - even getting bug reports with this you
01:38 - can go see what went wrong and you can
01:39 - go see the stack trays for every error
01:41 - so you can either fix the bug or add
01:43 - some safety checks it's also been
01:44 - awesome to hear that people play the
01:46 - game in multiplayer with their friends
01:47 - and apparently most of it went well I
01:49 - only got one strange report of invisible
01:51 - dinkies on the client so thankfully the
01:53 - multiplayer part seems to have gone
01:54 - surprisingly smooth my to-do list is
01:57 - truly massive thanks to all of your
01:58 - feedback I'm trying to get through it
01:59 - all all in continuing to push out
02:01 - constant updates until the end of
02:02 - Festival if you play the demo right when
02:04 - it came out on Monday then go ahead and
02:06 - give it another play thanks to all this
02:08 - awesome feedback it has already been
02:09 - massively improved since then I'm really
02:11 - happy with the state of the game right
02:12 - now and I'm really excited for the
02:13 - future there's definitely a ton of work
02:15 - left to do but I think the game is
02:17 - shaping up to be really great for the
02:18 - final release I think I managed to read
02:20 - all of the feedback that I could find so
02:22 - if you post a message somewhere and I
02:24 - miss it then please let me know now I've
02:26 - got to quickly finish recording and edit
02:27 - this video so I can get back to work so
02:29 - go ahead go play the latest build and
02:31 - let me know what you think alright so
