00:00 - hello and welcome I am your code monkey
00:01 - man the series were making snake in
00:03 - unity in this video we're going to
00:04 - create the main menu let's begin
00:09 - so here is our game we have the snake
00:12 - that we can move around and eat some
00:14 - food we have the score being trapped
00:16 - every time we eat some food and if we
00:18 - hit the body of the snake we get a nice
00:21 - game over window so the core of the game
00:23 - is completely working now let's create a
00:25 - main menu from which you can start the
00:27 - game or quit at the desktop in order to
00:30 - create the main menu scene we could
00:32 - create a new scene and set up the camera
00:34 - and UI again or we can just duplicate
00:37 - our game scene and start from there
00:38 - so it's implicit in all this the main
00:40 - menu alright now in the scene oh let's
00:43 - get rid of all the things related to the
00:44 - game and leave only the main camera and
00:46 - the UI setup okay so now in our canvas
00:55 - let's make the main menu so let's begin
00:57 - by making a container object for the
01:00 - main menu and let's stretch it to occupy
01:03 - all of the space now in here we're going
01:06 - to have three buttons play how to play
01:08 - and quit so let's make a single button
01:11 - first the button container inside let's
01:15 - make another game object for the
01:16 - background which will have an image and
01:19 - another game object for our text
01:33 - all right this is our button now let's
01:35 - add the button UI component this is part
01:39 - of the code monkey utilities it's just a
01:42 - script that already contains a bunch of
01:44 - helpful code to deal with buttons so in
01:46 - here for example I can change the hover
01:48 - behavior type change to set active on
01:52 - the background so essentially the
01:53 - background won't be displayed if the
01:55 - mouse is on top of the button so let's
01:57 - test there's the button then as you can
01:59 - see when I'm passing mouse over the
02:01 - background is automatically displayed in
02:03 - order to show that the button is
02:04 - selected all right so let's create the
02:07 - other buttons
02:26 - all right so this is our basic main menu
02:28 - with our three buttons to control it so
02:30 - let's make the script to deal with the
02:32 - code so we make a new c-sharp script for
02:35 - the main menu window now in here first
02:39 - on awake let's grab our references okay
02:49 - so here I have a reference to the point
02:51 - button so let's change the click
02:54 - function which is the function that is
02:56 - triggered when we click on the button
02:57 - and when we do all we need is to load
03:00 - the game scene so we do the unloader
03:03 - that we built in the previous video and
03:05 - we load the unloader not seen for the
03:08 - game scene so essentially we're doing
03:11 - the exact same thing that we were doing
03:12 - here on the GAMEOVER window we just load
03:14 - the game scene so the play button should
03:16 - be working let's see okay let's go to
03:19 - the play button and click and yep there
03:21 - you go we are now playing our game all
03:22 - right good
03:23 - so now let's deal with the quick button
03:28 - now in order to quit the desktop all we
03:30 - need to do is call application dot quit
03:34 - now we can't actually test this right
03:36 - now since this line doesn't do anything
03:38 - in the editor but if we build our
03:40 - executable it won't quit back to the
03:42 - desktop so with these two done all
03:45 - that's left is to make the how to play
03:47 - so let's first go into the editor and
03:49 - here let's create a window to display
03:52 - how the game is played so here with the
03:56 - new game object I'm going to push it to
03:58 - the side just make it easier to see both
04:00 - things at once but through code we won't
04:02 - automatically reposition it back on zero
04:04 - so inside let's add a background and
04:07 - some text fields explaining how the game
04:09 - is played
05:01 - all right so here is our very simple how
05:04 - to play window it teaches the player how
05:06 - to move what the goal is and what to
05:08 - avoid so now let's go into the code
05:11 - first let's reposition our window so we
05:19 - set the rect transform anchored position
05:21 - back to zero okay the only reason we're
05:23 - doing this is so that here in the editor
05:25 - we can similarly position things around
05:27 - so here is the window I can shift it in
05:29 - here and then through code when we run
05:30 - the game it won't automatically be
05:32 - positioned in there okay so let's run
05:34 - the code and see and yep there's the how
05:37 - to play window showing up on top now
05:39 - obviously we don't want it to always be
05:41 - visible and for example right now it's
05:43 - hiding the other buttons so let's figure
05:45 - out a way to show this window whilst
05:47 - hiding the main buttons so in the editor
05:49 - let's make two containers this one will
05:52 - be a container for the main submenu so
05:55 - in there I'm going to drag the main
05:57 - buttons all right like that and then
06:00 - another container for the how to play
06:03 - sub menu and let's drag the how to play
06:06 - window on there okay
06:08 - so now we have two very nice containers
06:10 - that we can show and hide whenever we
06:12 - want to change what is visible so back
06:15 - in the code here let's create an enum to
06:17 - handle of our sub menus so here making a
06:20 - private enum this will be our subs for
06:24 - our sub menus and essentially we have
06:26 - the main sub menu and then we have the
06:28 - how to play submit okay now let's make a
06:32 - function to show a specific sub menu now
06:37 - the first thing we want to do is hide
06:39 - everything
06:43 - so first we hide both subs and then we'd
06:47 - both of them hidden we do a switch on
06:49 - the sub we want to show and we never on
06:57 - the sub that we want to show all right
06:59 - so this should be working now up here on
07:02 - the awake lights fix this code since
07:03 - these references are no longer correct
07:05 - so in here the play button is now inside
07:09 - the main sub and same thing for lis quit
07:13 - button instead of sending the how to
07:15 - play window directly to zero we send the
07:18 - how to play sub and same thing for the
07:20 - main sub just in case we move it and now
07:23 - in here we can finally set the code for
07:26 - the how to play button when we click
07:31 - that button we simply do show sub and we
07:35 - show the how to play so and after
07:38 - everything is initialized we simply show
07:40 - sub for our main sub alright so we
07:45 - created an animal to keep track of the
07:46 - various sub menus we have on awake we
07:49 - reposition them both to zero in case we
07:51 - modify them in the editor and we have a
07:53 - nice show sub function first of all it
07:55 - hides all of our subs then it does a
07:58 - switch on the target sub and it shows
08:00 - that one run awake with all of our setup
08:03 - and then we show our main sub so it's
08:05 - seafoam this is working okay so first of
08:08 - all the how to play sub is not visible
08:10 - which is what we want but if we click on
08:12 - how to play we should now see these
08:14 - buttons as beer and how to play window
08:16 - appear click and yep there you go
08:18 - there's the window and the main buttons
08:20 - are gone all right great now obviously
08:22 - we need a way to go back to the main sub
08:23 - so let's add a back button to this sub
08:29 - and here in the code and let's set up
08:31 - the code for that back button so
08:34 - essentially it's only how to play sub
08:37 - and when we click it we go back to the
08:40 - main cell alright let's see okay here it
08:43 - is everything works fine click on how to
08:45 - play there's know how to play window and
08:46 - now there's the back button click
08:48 - and now we're back into the main money
08:49 - all right great and again clicking on
08:52 - quit still works except we can't test it
08:54 - in the editor and click on play doesn't
08:56 - need start our game all right so
08:59 - everything is working just fine
09:00 - so now that we have the main menu fully
09:03 - working let's deal with adding a pause
09:05 - menu so we can go back to the main menu
09:06 - from the game so let's open up the game
09:09 - scene and in here on the UI where we
09:12 - made the game over window let's create a
09:14 - pause window now first let's add a
09:18 - background to darken everything and
09:23 - extend it to occupy the entire window
09:26 - again we are shifting it to the side so
09:29 - it is not occupying the rest of our UI
09:31 - and through code we will put it back on
09:33 - the center so in here we're going to do
09:35 - very much the same thing that we did
09:37 - with the main menu so let's make some
09:39 - buttons
09:59 - alright so the editor is set up we
10:02 - created some buttons exactly like we did
10:04 - for the main menu so now it's dealing
10:06 - with the code let's make a new C sharp
10:08 - script this will be the pause window and
10:12 - here the same thing let's go on to our
10:14 - awake get the reference to our buttons
10:24 - now for the main menu button it's very
10:27 - simple we just use the alert class to
10:29 - load back into our main menu so we need
10:32 - to add that in there so on the unloader
10:36 - and let's a new a new value for the main
10:38 - menu and again here in the editor we
10:41 - need to go into our build settings and
10:43 - drag our main menu onto the built list
10:45 - ok and now we need to deal with the code
10:48 - for resuming our game which also means
10:50 - that we need to deal with the code to
10:52 - pause our game so in order to do that
10:54 - let's do it on the game Handler down
10:56 - here and let's make a function so now in
11:01 - here we need a way to resume our game so
11:04 - we're going to add that function into
11:06 - the game handler game handler dot resume
11:09 - game we're going to do that function
11:12 - later now in here let's add some
11:14 - functions to show and hide this window
11:16 - just like we did in here for the game
11:18 - over window some basic show and hide
11:20 - functions and we call hide by default
11:27 - since the window isn't supposed to be
11:29 - visible all right so this should be
11:34 - working so now let's make the resume
11:36 - game function only game Hamlet when we
11:41 - resume the game let's hide the pause
11:43 - window and let's also make a function to
11:49 - pause our game
11:53 - and when we pause we tell the pause
11:56 - window to show static alright now in
12:00 - order to pass our game we're simply
12:01 - going to do time that time scale and set
12:05 - it to 0 F the time scale essentially
12:08 - applies a modifier to our time.deltatime
12:11 - so if it's zero the delta time will be
12:13 - zero since we were moving our snake
12:15 - using Delta time that means our game
12:17 - won't be stopped and obviously on resume
12:19 - we need to do the opposite which is set
12:21 - a time scale back to 1 all right so all
12:24 - of this code should be working now we
12:26 - need a way to trigger the pause game
12:28 - function so let's go here on the game
12:30 - handler make a update function and on
12:34 - the update let's capture the Escape key
12:38 - if we press escape let's pause the game
12:41 - so game handlers dock pause game all
12:44 - right so let's test and see if we can
12:46 - pause by pressing escape okay first of
12:49 - all the pause we know is not visible
12:50 - exactly as we want now let's eat
12:53 - something all right and I'm gonna press
12:55 - escape and the game didn't need pause
12:57 - but the window did not show up
12:59 - let's see why that is if we pause the
13:01 - game we can see that the window isn't it
13:03 - visible but it is shifted to the side so
13:06 - through code we need to move it back
13:07 - into the zero so let's do that here on
13:10 - the awake we simply start the transform
13:17 - alright so we set the anchored position
13:19 - any size Delta both to zero so now the
13:22 - window should be correctly shifted to
13:23 - the middle of the screen whenever we
13:25 - start a game so let's see all right so
13:28 - here we are and again everything works
13:29 - fine and now if I press escape
13:31 - yep there you go the pause window has
13:33 - indeed showed up with both of our
13:35 - buttons saying pause and as you can see
13:36 - in the background a snake has stopped
13:38 - moving so now let's see if it resumed
13:41 - when I click on resumed any of there you
13:43 - go the snake is moving again and again I
13:45 - can control it and move and eat all
13:46 - right great
13:47 - now there's one thing we can do to
13:49 - improve our code in here if I press
13:52 - escape
13:52 - it does indeed pause the game but
13:54 - pressing it again no longer does
13:56 - anything we need to now shift to the
13:58 - mouse in order to click resume so this
14:00 - is a very simple thing to improve so
14:02 - let's see on with that here on the game
14:04 - hammer let's make another function
14:06 - a public static ball is game pause and
14:12 - in here all we're going to do is return
14:13 - if the time time scale if it is 0 if
14:18 - there is 0 then the game is indeed
14:20 - passed so now we can use this function
14:22 - when we go up here when we capture for
14:24 - our escape key if the game is already
14:28 - paused then we do game Handler dot
14:30 - resume game and if not then we pause the
14:34 - game all right so let's test and see if
14:37 - our escape key now works as a pause
14:39 - toggle okay there's a snake moving press
14:42 - escape
14:42 - there's the pause screen press skip
14:44 - again and yep there you go over the game
14:45 - has resumed and I can still move and now
14:48 - eat another one pause and go back and it
14:51 - does go back now I can pause and also
14:53 - test out the main menu and if there you
14:56 - go we are back into the main menu which
14:57 - again shows the how to play go back go
14:59 - back into the play screen back into the
15:02 - pause and resume and everything works
15:04 - just fine so there you have it we have
15:06 - the main menu where we can sir a game
15:08 - quit the desktop or really how to play
15:10 - instructions we also create a pause menu
15:13 - and add the code to listen to an escape
15:15 - key press to pause and resume the game
15:17 - in the next video we're going to deal
15:18 - with sound and saving the high score as
15:21 - always you can download the project
15:22 - files in utilities from in tucumán keep
15:24 - calm if you have any questions post them
15:26 - in the comments and I'll do my best to
15:27 - answer them subscribe for more videos
15:28 - and I'll see you next time
