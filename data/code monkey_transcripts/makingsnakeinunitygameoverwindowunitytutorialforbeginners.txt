00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - man the series were making snake
00:03 - immunity in this video we're going to
00:05 - create a game over window let's begin
00:10 - okay so this is our game we currently
00:12 - have the snake moving around and if we
00:14 - eat some food you can see that the snake
00:15 - rose and if the body is big enough I can
00:19 - hit the snake body and the snake dies
00:21 - right now that just makes the game stop
00:23 - but in the previous video we have the
00:25 - unloader and we have our nice debug
00:28 - button in here so we can click it to
00:30 - test game loading so I click it and
00:31 - there you go it reloads the game scene
00:33 - and everything is back to start now all
00:36 - we need is a proper game over window
00:37 - that shows up when we die and run the
00:39 - same code that is on this button so
00:42 - let's build our window in our canvas so
00:45 - let's make a new game object this will
00:46 - be our game over window now inside let's
00:50 - make a button so an empty game object
00:52 - for the container for the button this
00:55 - won't be the retry button enzyme let's
00:58 - first make an image for the background
01:00 - and a text field
01:16 - okay so here is our very nice very
01:19 - simple retry button so in order to
01:21 - capture button clicks let's add the
01:23 - button UI component this is a class from
01:26 - the code mock utilities it has a bunch
01:28 - of features for a UI button so it's very
01:30 - useful for example let's make the button
01:33 - background change onmouseover so in here
01:35 - I can very simply do this again you
01:37 - don't have to use the utilities you can
01:39 - use the basic Unity buttons but this one
01:41 - already helps me make a very nice button
01:43 - okay so now that we have the editor all
01:45 - set up let's see on with the code so for
01:47 - that let's make new C sharp script to
01:49 - handle our window so in new let's call
01:51 - it our game over a window now here on a
01:54 - wait let's grab a reference to our
01:56 - button so we grab the button UI
02:04 - component and now in here we can set the
02:06 - click func which is the function that is
02:09 - triggered whenever we click on the
02:10 - button and now what we want to do when
02:14 - we click the button is the same thing we
02:15 - were doing on our testing button so we
02:17 - can go into the game hammer and let's go
02:19 - down here here's where we were making
02:21 - our testing button so this is all we
02:23 - need in order to load our current game
02:25 - scene all right so let's set and see if
02:27 - the button is visible and if it's
02:29 - working the same as previously okay so
02:31 - there's the button it's nice and visible
02:32 - if I pass the mouse over it changes
02:34 - Congre which is nice and now if I click
02:36 - on it if there you go with mode the
02:38 - loading scene and then immediately our
02:40 - game scene and everything resets so I
02:42 - can go down here eat that now I have 100
02:44 - and the body size of 1 now hit retry and
02:47 - there we go everything is back to normal
02:49 - ok so far so good our button is being
02:51 - visible and it is working exactly as we
02:54 - want however obviously since this is a
02:56 - game over window we want the window to
02:58 - only show when snake dies so let's make
03:00 - some show and hide functions let's start
03:02 - off by making a private void show in
03:05 - order to show let's simply do a game
03:07 - object that's set active to true when we
03:11 - disable our game object everything is
03:12 - hidden when we enable everything is
03:14 - shown so let's do the opposite for the
03:16 - private oil hi
03:19 - and now on awake let's come over height
03:23 - since by default our game over window
03:25 - should be hidden now we need some way of
03:27 - showing this window so let's use a
03:29 - static function now in order to access
03:33 - our show function we need to know the
03:35 - instance so let's store a private static
03:37 - instance and on our show static we can
03:42 - now call the instance dot show alright
03:45 - so that's it this is a very similar
03:47 - question I spawn Ecstatic function that
03:49 - we can come whenever we want to show the
03:51 - winner so now we need to figure out
03:53 - where we're going to call this so let's
03:55 - go into the game hammer in here we had
03:57 - something to get scored net score and
03:59 - let's also have a function that won't be
04:01 - called when the snake dies and then here
04:05 - all we do is go into the game over
04:06 - window and show our game over window so
04:10 - now again the same thing we need to
04:11 - trigger this function from somewhere so
04:13 - for that let's go into the snake and see
04:17 - where we have our snake being set to
04:19 - dead and there it is we got a nice
04:21 - testing pop-up we can now hide that and
04:24 - when it dies let's call the game hammer
04:26 - that snake died okay so that should be
04:30 - working so now we have our snake when
04:32 - our snake dies it changes its state so
04:33 - it stops moving and we call the game
04:35 - handler that snake died then the game
04:37 - handler deals with telling the UI to
04:40 - show our game over window and our came
04:41 - over window has a retry button so we can
04:43 - try again so let's run the game and see
04:46 - okay here we are and as you can see the
04:48 - button is not visible exactly as we want
04:51 - it to so let's grow eat a bunch of food
04:54 - so there's that one down there okay so
04:57 - our snake is big enough to die so let's
04:59 - wrap around and die and yep there you go
05:02 - the snake is that the window popped up
05:04 - and we now have our nice retry button so
05:06 - now I can click the retry button and
05:08 - there you go the loading window and now
05:10 - it's back into the main window and I can
05:12 - try again to beat my score so there you
05:14 - have it to create a proper game over
05:16 - window that pops up when the snake dies
05:18 - and contains a button so we can easily
05:20 - retry in order to try again in the next
05:23 - video we're going to create the main
05:24 - menu as always you can download the
05:26 - project files and utilities from
