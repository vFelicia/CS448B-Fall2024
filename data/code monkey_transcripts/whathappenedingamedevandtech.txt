00:00 - Unity updated their UI tools Boston
00:02 - Dynamics new robot is straight out of
00:04 - the exist someone made Joker into an
00:06 - open world game people keep asking about
00:08 - silong and more today is the 21st of
00:11 - April 2024 and you're watching The Game
00:13 - Dev
00:14 - [Music]
00:19 - report starting off with the unity AI
00:22 - update as of now all five Muse
00:24 - capabilities are now usable directly
00:25 - inside the engine you can generate
00:27 - textures and you can generate Sprites
00:29 - you now also have access ACC to the
00:30 - prival of the animate this one lets you
00:32 - generate animations from text prompts
00:34 - and behavior which lets you generate
00:35 - Behavior trees for doing things like
00:37 - enemy Ai and M chat is also now
00:39 - available directly in the editor which
00:40 - brings with it one huge bonus now it is
00:43 - Project aware I'm extremely curious to
00:44 - try out all these tools animate sounds
00:46 - very useful and Muse chat being project
00:48 - aware makes it sound like it's insanely
00:50 - useful for doing things like debugging
00:52 - or project brainstorming they also
00:53 - published a GDC talk all about doing AI
00:55 - inference directly on device that sounds
00:57 - like a really interesting topic so I'm
00:58 - definitely going to watch it he and for
01:00 - non AI news they put out a really nice
01:02 - really interesting 48 minute tutorial
01:04 - all about their game happy harvest which
01:06 - is made using urp it goes through how to
01:08 - model new crops in blender how to create
01:10 - textures and normal maps how to set up
01:11 - the lights set up the prefabs and even
01:13 - work with UI toen yet another awesome
01:15 - thing is the updated urp and hrp ebooks
01:18 - these are completely free and containing
01:19 - a mountain of information they are
01:20 - literally over 300 pages long these are
01:22 - super detailed super in depth so if you
01:24 - want to learn anything about how
01:25 - rendering works I definitely recommend
01:27 - you give this a look one developer has
01:29 - reimagined the movie Joker in Unreal
01:31 - Engine 5 as a sort of open world game
01:33 - although calling it open world game is a
01:34 - little bit of a stretch there's no real
01:36 - gameplay it's just visuals and
01:37 - animations but for that it is absolutely
01:40 - gorgeous they have perfectly recreated a
01:42 - bunch of environments directly from the
01:43 - movie these feature some insanely
01:45 - high-end textures insanely high quality
01:47 - lighting more than anything this
01:48 - actually showcased the power of today's
01:50 - tools from what I can see this was all
01:51 - done just by a single developer so
01:53 - really impressive where inspector says
01:54 - that the next logical step for immersive
01:56 - Sims is multiplayer the game director
01:58 - that worked on games like Ultima System
02:00 - Shock and D X believes that by using
02:02 - multiplayer it can lead to more player
02:04 - athor scenarios so basically the kind of
02:06 - experience that you can create with
02:07 - tabletop games his Studio other side
02:09 - Entertainment is currently working on a
02:10 - game titled thick as thieves it's a
02:12 - thief versus Thief immersive similar
02:14 - game where players have to compete with
02:15 - each other in order to steal some
02:17 - artifacts and see who makes the most out
02:18 - of this open environment it sounds
02:20 - really interesting in theory although
02:21 - making an immersive Sim in multiplayer
02:23 - sounds like quite the challenge I would
02:24 - say the main difference between making
02:25 - some like a video game versus some like
02:27 - Dungeons and Dragons the main difference
02:28 - is the lack of a game master so this is
02:31 - actually one scenario where AI might be
02:32 - really useful in games having an AI with
02:35 - context of the game itself generates
02:36 - some really interesting scenarios on the
02:37 - Fly that could be an really interesting
02:39 - experience so if you're looking for your
02:40 - next prototype to try out this weekend
02:42 - maybe give that idea a try in a bit of
02:43 - nice news the devs for play dat have
02:45 - collectively earned over $500,000 that's
02:48 - over 150,000 copies sold that's a really
02:51 - very nice amount for what is a very
02:53 - Niche device the play date is a tiny
02:55 - physical handheld device with a really
02:56 - strange crank all the games are built
02:58 - specifically for this device these types
03:00 - of Niche things can sometimes be really
03:02 - useful for Indie devs even though you
03:03 - might not sell a million copies just the
03:05 - fact that there is so much less
03:07 - competition there's only a handful of
03:08 - developers just that might help you
03:09 - stand out although of course getting on
03:11 - these devices also is one of the things
03:13 - that requires lots of networking so it
03:14 - can be trick to get in but if you do get
03:16 - in it can have some nice bonuses over on
03:18 - Reddit there's two really awesome
03:19 - postmortem one is on the game seller
03:21 - settlers which is a colony building Sim
03:24 - with a really nice really chill Vibe on
03:25 - seam it has over 200 very positive
03:28 - reviews and according to the developer
03:29 - has stld 10,000 copies and generated
03:31 - 70,000 in gross revenue they launched
03:33 - into Early Access with 36,000 wish lists
03:36 - it was made quickly in just 6 months
03:37 - with a team of about four people and on
03:39 - the other side we have minim Lane this
03:41 - is a tiny cozy Street management game
03:43 - with some very common Vibes a 3% team
03:46 - built this game over the course of 6
03:47 - months it's already got, 1500 reviews
03:50 - they have sold over 50,000 copies which
03:52 - equals over $200,000 in gross revenue
03:54 - this one launched with 50,000 wish lists
03:56 - the wish list count actually started off
03:57 - strong strong right away noways visuals
03:59 - are extr important so having a game that
04:01 - looks visually interesting and has a
04:02 - unique concept just that alone can push
04:05 - your game to the top right from the very
04:06 - beginning and then of course it
04:07 - completely blew up during steam nextfest
04:09 - these two I think are really great
04:11 - examples of how you can build something
04:12 - really awesome in just 6 months so you
04:14 - don't have to spend three to four years
04:16 - making your very first indie game my
04:17 - advice is always make smaller projects
04:19 - as opposed to really big ones okay so
04:21 - now let's move on to the tech
04:23 - News Boston Dynamics has unveiled their
04:25 - latest iteration of their Atlas robot
04:27 - they made a video showcasing all the
04:29 - iteration to get to this point it's
04:31 - really awesome it's really quite
04:32 - incredible how far robotics has come in
04:34 - just a handful of years the new Atlas
04:35 - has no Hydraulics it's only electric
04:37 - motors this is their most advanced robot
04:39 - yet one huge benefit of that is how it
04:41 - has no limitations in terms of movement
04:43 - some people think this becomes quite a
04:44 - little bit creepy quite a little bit
04:46 - like the exist but it certainly makes
04:47 - sense that robots should not inherently
04:49 - have all the regular Lim limitations
04:51 - that human beings have by having none of
04:53 - those limitations it gives it an insane
04:55 - amount of freedom in alternate universe
04:57 - if I hadn't gotten into gimd I would
04:58 - have loved to explore robotic so
04:59 - personally I find this really
05:00 - fascinating and now a quick message from
05:02 - our sponsor which is me if you want to
05:04 - learn how to make games or make websites
05:06 - if you want to learn robotics
05:07 - Electronics or just about anything if so
05:09 - then learning C is a super useful skill
05:11 - you can learn for free right now over
05:13 - here on YouTube with my C course you can
05:15 - watch the free videos or get the premium
05:17 - version which includes interactive
05:18 - exercises and a ton of other bonuses to
05:20 - help you learn by doing check it out to
05:21 - the link in the description the Met
05:23 - Quest 2 got a permanent price cut to
05:25 - $1.99 price is still one of the main
05:27 - barriers for VR adoption so I think this
05:29 - is great new at this price point
05:30 - hopefully it will increase the size of
05:32 - the audience for VR games which will
05:34 - hopefully allow developers to make
05:35 - bigger VR games with a higher budget and
05:37 - still make it work technically The Quest
05:39 - 2 has since been surpassed by the quest
05:40 - 3 but it's still a really excellent
05:42 - device it's the main one that I have and
05:44 - it still works really great in fact
05:45 - recently I've actually been using it
05:47 - quite a lot I've been working with a fun
05:48 - moap animation tool so definitely stay
05:50 - tuned for that video tomorrow on Monday
05:52 - also about meta they have recently
05:53 - released their latest AI model LMA 3 it
05:56 - has a version with 70 billion parameters
05:57 - and another version with 8 billion so so
05:59 - far the results seem pretty impressive
06:01 - it can be chat GPT on a bunch of
06:02 - scenarios they've also made a web portal
06:04 - where you can supposedly use it however
06:06 - it's apparently region lock so I don't
06:08 - have access to it over here in Portugal
06:09 - meta has been following the interesting
06:11 - approach of making their AI models open
06:13 - source meaning anyone can use it so you
06:15 - can go ahead and grab it and use it in
06:16 - your projects one topic that I would
06:18 - love to explore would be grabbing this
06:19 - model and seeing if I can somehow make
06:21 - it work using the inference engine of
06:22 - unity using Unity sentes I saw a post on
06:25 - Twitter where they had this La model
06:26 - working with a Raspberry Pi so if it
06:28 - works in there then I assume it would
06:30 - work inside some kind of unity game
06:32 - either on desktop or mobile Apple has
06:33 - started allowing emulators on their
06:35 - store and Delta has been added to it
06:37 - this apparently a really capable
06:39 - emulator so if there's any Retro Game
06:40 - you'd like to do then now is the perfect
06:42 - time to go play it the games work great
06:44 - and can be combined with a controller in
06:45 - terms of legality you really just need
06:47 - to own the ROMs of the games that you
06:49 - want to play you can play NES SES
06:51 - Nintendo 64 Nintendo DS game boy and a
06:53 - bunch more now let's move on to some
06:54 - gaming
06:57 - news a game 14 years in the making is
07:00 - now out it's called Herold halot it's a
07:02 - very interesting game with a very unique
07:04 - visual design just by looking at it for
07:06 - one second you can mly tell that this
07:08 - looks like something quite different
07:09 - nowadays if you want to send out you
07:10 - need to be visually unique and this is
07:12 - an excellent example of exactly that the
07:13 - game features a very unique stop motion
07:15 - style the gam playay itself is a story
07:17 - BR Adventure Steam Reviews are sitting
07:19 - at mostly positive with some of the
07:21 - negatives being fetch quests and it's a
07:23 - little bit too drawn out however critics
07:25 - appear to love it with lots of nines and
07:27 - tens across the board another
07:28 - interesting game that is fun finding
07:29 - quite a bit of viral success thanks to
07:31 - its interesting premise is called
07:33 - Rusty's retirement this is a game that
07:35 - you play at the very bottom of your
07:36 - desktop while you're doing other things
07:38 - this feels really like the perfect
07:39 - addition to the idle game genre instead
07:41 - of playing on a second monitor you can
07:43 - play literally at the bottom of your
07:44 - first monitor I think this idea sounds
07:46 - really genius and I'm definitely not
07:47 - alone the game currently has 6,500
07:49 - followers which likely means over 70,000
07:52 - wish list so whenever this one does come
07:53 - out it's bound to be a huge hit and for
07:55 - something a little bit less Jolly lately
07:57 - whenever there's some kind of any
07:58 - showcase like the the triaa initiative
08:00 - or the Nintendo Indie world event when
08:02 - these happen there's always tons and
08:03 - tons of comments asking nothing but
08:05 - silksong it's really awesome for devs of
08:07 - that game to know that people are
08:08 - insanely hungry to play the next title
08:10 - but at the same time it kind of sucks
08:12 - for all developers of all the games that
08:13 - are being showcased in all these
08:14 - showcases it feels like their games get
08:16 - ran out because there's a vocal minority
08:18 - of people that just want one game and
08:19 - nothing else so it's awesome to see the
08:21 - positive hyp for silk song but too much
08:23 - hyp can also be a bad thing although the
08:24 - great news is that Indie Games continue
08:26 - to be more and more awesome if there's
08:28 - anything you want to play in pretty much
08:29 - any genre you can always find something
08:30 - great and now let's go over to the quick
08:32 - F
08:34 - rounds over on Reddit there's a post
08:37 - questioning what exactly does $50,000 in
08:39 - marketing buy you one person who runs a
08:41 - marketing agency respond on what exactly
08:43 - you could do with it although if you are
08:44 - an indie Dev keep in mind that this
08:46 - strategy is very high risk IND the games
08:48 - are usually pretty cheap so getting a
08:50 - return investment in terms of
08:51 - advertising usually is quite tricky
08:52 - unless you have a super huge budget GTA
08:55 - V was apparently being filmed while in
08:56 - development with the goal of making some
08:58 - kind of documentary that that apparently
09:00 - suddenly has never come out if you're a
09:01 - fan of Game Dev documentaries I highly
09:03 - recommend the channel no clip they've
09:04 - got some really awesome ones and the
09:06 - first one that I saw that I absolutely
09:07 - adored was the documentary on the making
09:09 - of the game Broken Age it was part of
09:11 - the kickstarter I backed it just because
09:12 - of the documentary and I absolutely
09:14 - loved it then here's an interesting
09:15 - question why do most solo devs keep
09:17 - remaining as a solo Dev even after
09:19 - getting a massive head I believe the
09:20 - answer to this question is exactly the
09:22 - top comment on the post it simply says
09:23 - how managing people suckss personally I
09:25 - have no interest in managing people so
09:27 - even if one of my games became a massive
09:29 - hit I would not go out and hire 20
09:31 - people and make a massive Indie Studio
09:33 - I'm really a big fan of making small
09:34 - games either ACC by myself or in work
09:36 - with one to two other people then a very
09:38 - common post about all the issues that
09:40 - you can find with doing indie game
09:41 - marketing nowadays and how it's really
09:43 - hard to reach people although in this
09:44 - example I would say just needs a tiny
09:46 - few things in order to find success but
09:48 - maybe I'm biased because I'm already a
09:49 - fan of the genre itself I wrote a reply
09:51 - to this post with my marketing tips for
09:53 - this have and maybe some of those might
09:54 - also be helpful to you and to end on a
09:56 - positive note here's a nice fun comic
09:58 - all about life after I really do like
10:00 - hearing people say that some like oh
10:02 - year 20s are the best years of your life
10:03 - and it's all downhill from there my
10:05 - personal experience has been the exact
10:06 - opposite I'm 35 right now and my life is
10:09 - 100 times better than doing in my 20s so
10:11 - if you're also in your 20s and you're
10:12 - struggling through life just know it can
10:13 - get better nowadays your 30s for and 50s
10:16 - can definitely be the best years of your
10:17 - life all right so that's the Game Dev
10:19 - report for today all these stories are
10:21 - linked Below in the description as you
10:22 - can see this is a new format that I'm
10:23 - trying out let me know in the comments
10:25 - if you do like this if so I might make
10:26 - it a more regular thing so go ahead and
10:28 - hit the like button button to let me
10:29 - know if you like this oh and stay tuned
10:31 - for a really fun video coming out
10:32 - tomorrow I've been playing with a really
10:34 - interesting VR tool that I think can be
10:35 - very helpful to Indie devs all right so
10:38 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
10:39 - next time
