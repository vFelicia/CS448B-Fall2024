00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and unity currently has a contest
00:04 - running where you can actually win
00:05 - a real car apparently this contest has
00:08 - been running since late february but
00:09 - i've only heard about it just now
00:11 - the submission date is pretty tight it's
00:13 - already next week but still i want to
00:14 - make a quick video just in case you want
00:16 - to participate then who knows maybe win
00:18 - a car
00:19 - specifically it's a volkswagen id4 with
00:21 - a value of 40 000
00:23 - and the runner up prices are also pretty
00:24 - good there's 300
00:26 - worth of unity swag so the goal of the
00:28 - contest is to make something using unity
00:30 - forma
00:31 - this is a new tool built by unity that
00:33 - is meant to help you easily create some
00:35 - real-time 3d product configurators so
00:37 - the most obvious
00:38 - example is something like a car where
00:40 - you can inspect and interact with the 3d
00:42 - model in tons of ways so you can change
00:44 - the colors move the wheels pop the trunk
00:46 - and so on
00:47 - or maybe instead of a car you have
00:48 - something like a furniture store where
00:50 - you create something to showcase a
00:52 - custom desk and demonstrate all of its
00:53 - features
00:54 - or maybe for clothes to change the color
00:57 - the fabric and so on
00:58 - then you can make a normal build or
01:00 - publish it to the cloud and access the
01:02 - configurator through any web browser
01:04 - so it's a pretty interesting tool for
01:05 - marketing various products
01:07 - now usually this is a paid tool but
01:09 - while the contest is running you can
01:10 - test it out for free so even if you
01:12 - don't end up submitting anything to the
01:14 - contest this is a great way to test it
01:15 - out if it's something you're interested
01:17 - i did just that i downloaded it myself
01:19 - to try it out
01:20 - so here is the official demo it's a car
01:23 - configurator
01:24 - if you just want to try out this demo
01:25 - you don't need to actually download it
01:27 - you can do that through the browser on
01:28 - the website
01:29 - so it's a really cool car i'm pretty
01:31 - sure this is fictional i don't think
01:32 - this brand actually exists
01:34 - but it's a really good looking high-end
01:35 - sports car so the whole point of unt
01:37 - forma is to make it super simple to
01:39 - create a configuration like this
01:41 - so for example over here i can change
01:43 - around the color pack so make it in red
01:45 - and see how the car looks like i can try
01:47 - rotating the wheels
01:48 - just to see it i can open up the doors
01:51 - and look from any angle and so on this
01:54 - whole thing is a unity scene so i can
01:55 - also load just a different environment
01:58 - so here's on a soft flat so a really
02:00 - good looking environment
02:01 - then you can change the color of the
02:03 - calipers over here change the seat back
02:05 - color go inside the various cameras and
02:07 - there's all these
02:08 - for example going to the interior camera
02:10 - if there it is look at that the whole
02:12 - interior
02:12 - so as you can see this is a great tool
02:14 - to easily create a configurator so the
02:16 - customer can see
02:17 - their specific customized product
02:18 - exactly as they want it this is the
02:20 - built-in configurator to demonstrate
02:22 - what the tool can do
02:23 - now the goal with the contest is to
02:25 - actually build your own and for that it
02:27 - doesn't actually have to be just a car
02:29 - it can be just about anything so for
02:31 - example you can make it with some
02:33 - furniture or maybe some clothes or maybe
02:35 - a house
02:35 - you can check the official rules for
02:37 - more info and according to those rules i
02:39 - believe you can use assets from the
02:41 - asset store
02:41 - so thankfully there's actually spring
02:43 - sale running right now so that's pretty
02:45 - helpful if you want to participate you
02:46 - can get some great assets at a nice
02:47 - discount and use them in your demo
02:49 - now when you sign up you get the link to
02:51 - download unity forma which is what i
02:53 - have open here
02:54 - by the way if you find the video helpful
02:56 - please hit the like button
02:57 - it's a tiny thing but really does help
02:59 - thanks so this is a different interface
03:01 - but this is exactly still
03:02 - unity so in fact i can simply go into
03:04 - forma into switch mode
03:06 - and there you go now i'm back on the
03:07 - standard ent window so as you can see
03:09 - this is a tool that is built on top of
03:11 - unity so just go ahead switch mode and
03:13 - back into the unity form of view
03:15 - okay so let's take a look at this and
03:17 - see how this all works
03:18 - now on the right side you've got the
03:20 - product outline so this is some sort of
03:22 - hierarchy
03:22 - so it shows all the various parts of the
03:25 - product or model or anything you have
03:27 - then on the left side you have over here
03:29 - all these buttons so the first one is
03:31 - for the product
03:32 - so this is where you add all the various
03:34 - variants so for example
03:35 - up here you've got the various color
03:37 - packs so i can inspect the yellow color
03:39 - pack the red
03:40 - black and so on with the pack selected
03:43 - you can see down here all of the various
03:44 - settings
03:45 - so for example this is a pack which
03:47 - means that it will apply all of these
03:49 - individual changes
03:50 - so it won't change the car paint into
03:52 - blue it will change the leather into
03:54 - dark blue and so on
03:55 - so this is a pack of multiple changes
03:57 - and then you've got the individual
03:58 - changes so for example the body color
04:00 - just double click and there you go now
04:02 - we've got an ember body and then here
04:03 - you can see what this variant actually
04:05 - does
04:06 - so if you scroll down you see the
04:07 - various assignments so these are the
04:09 - various object parts that get modified
04:11 - and they get set with this particular
04:13 - material
04:14 - and with this color so for example you
04:15 - can see this one will change the
04:17 - material
04:17 - up here for the front splitter so change
04:20 - into ember then changing to aqua
04:22 - so all it's doing is selecting a bunch
04:25 - of object parts and then setting their
04:26 - material in their color
04:28 - now how you work with this tool is very
04:30 - simple so up here just click on add
04:32 - let's create a new material variant set
04:34 - and for this one let's
04:35 - say i want to change the color over here
04:37 - on the front bumper
04:39 - so i can just rename this so this is the
04:41 - front bumper
04:43 - and then let's say rename this one and
04:45 - this one will be in white
04:46 - so to select what objects i want to be
04:48 - modified when i select this option
04:50 - i can just select the object on the
04:52 - scene so i want to select the front
04:53 - bumper
04:54 - then you go here and let's select the
04:55 - home front bumper and down here it says
04:58 - the material that this object is using
04:59 - so i can right click
05:00 - and add assignment to the selected
05:02 - variant and there you go down here now
05:04 - i've got the various assignments so the
05:05 - various objects that won't be changed
05:06 - when i select this option
05:08 - so for this one let's change the
05:09 - material into a white color
05:11 - and there you go now i've made a variant
05:13 - to change the bumper color into white
05:15 - and if i want i can create a new
05:17 - material variant and for this one
05:18 - let's make it a black and let's reset it
05:21 - back into the black material
05:22 - okay so here i've added two variants for
05:24 - the front bumper set it in black satin
05:26 - white and so on
05:27 - so that's how you play around and add
05:29 - the various configurator options
05:31 - then next thing you have is the
05:32 - environments so this essentially loads a
05:35 - different unity scene
05:36 - so for example let's go into the luxury
05:38 - showroom and yup so that essentially
05:40 - loads a different ent scene that is used
05:42 - for the background
05:43 - then we've also got the various cameras
05:46 - so these are the multiple preset
05:47 - viewpoints that you can create
05:49 - so you can click on any of them there's
05:51 - already a bunch of preset ones
05:53 - and if you select down here and over
05:54 - here you can see the various options
05:56 - and if you're familiar with hdrp cameras
05:58 - and all this won't be familiar
06:00 - so you've got the basic you can change
06:01 - the field of view change the behavior
06:04 - type so free analog orbit and so on
06:06 - then on the advanced you can set it to
06:07 - follow or look at a certain object
06:09 - so if you want to make an automatic
06:11 - camera that moves around then of course
06:13 - you've got the scene machine
06:14 - so this works with cine machine then
06:16 - you've got some blending then for the
06:18 - animation this one is using the timeline
06:20 - so if you're familiar with that you can
06:21 - easily use this
06:22 - and over here on the appearance you can
06:24 - also create a custom volume profile
06:26 - so you can add it and for example add
06:27 - tons of post-rusting effects
06:29 - so for example on this one let's
06:31 - massively increase the saturation there
06:32 - you go
06:33 - so you can make each camera look exactly
06:35 - as you want it
06:36 - and then finally you've got some rules
06:38 - so this is pretty interesting
06:39 - this one lets you tell that if you
06:41 - select a certain thing then a certain
06:43 - other thing is no longer available
06:45 - for example add new rule let's say
06:48 - if the red color pack is selected then
06:51 - i'm going to say
06:52 - that the material variant set of the one
06:54 - that we made so the front bumper
06:56 - so if you select the red pack you cannot
06:58 - select a white bumper
06:59 - so this is how you configure the various
07:01 - options and combinations
07:03 - and then finally over here you've got
07:04 - the new build so this is how you select
07:06 - the profile and make an actual proper
07:08 - build
07:09 - so here you select the profile so hdrp
07:11 - is meant to look really good
07:13 - then you've got the products so would
07:15 - select your own custom product if you
07:16 - want to submit
07:18 - and then just go ahead and click on
07:19 - build so if you want to submit your own
07:21 - entry to the contest
07:22 - first of all just go ahead and grab
07:24 - whatever asset you want to showcase
07:26 - then go up here into the gear icon and
07:28 - open up the profile settings then up
07:30 - here click on add to add a new product
07:32 - in this case i'm going to add from the
07:33 - unt project and i'm going to select just
07:36 - a car that i grab from the asset store
07:38 - and up here is my car so again i can go
07:40 - ahead create all kinds of variants in
07:42 - order to modify the color and so on to
07:44 - make my custom configurator
07:45 - alright so that's unt forma it's a
07:47 - really interesting tool that showcases
07:49 - how unity is a great real-time 3d engine
07:51 - that goes beyond just game development
07:53 - now the price for this contest is really
07:55 - awesome it's an actual real car
07:57 - specifically it's a volkswagen id4 worth
07:59 - 40 thousand dollars
08:00 - and renter prices are also really good i
