00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your a code monkey
00:02 - and this is a quick video announcing the
00:03 - code monkey steam app this is something
00:06 - I've been thinking about doing for a
00:07 - long time and I think it's a really
00:09 - exciting idea the store page is live so
00:11 - check the link in the description to add
00:12 - it to your wish list and phone doing so
00:15 - really helps out in getting some
00:16 - visibility on Steam and when it comes
00:18 - out you won't be notified and the app
00:19 - will also be free so the goal with this
00:22 - is to have a nice simple app containing
00:24 - all the completed games I've made for
00:26 - this channel so for example the build of
00:28 - doom that I made recently the wash your
00:30 - hands video game the top-down shooter
00:32 - flappy bird snake and minesweeper all of
00:35 - those won't easily be playable through
00:36 - the app it will also have a bunch of
00:39 - interactive tutorials for learning game
00:41 - design and programming I'm still a
00:43 - terrain on how to present those but they
00:45 - should be very interesting and provide a
00:47 - different new way of learning and it
00:49 - will also obviously contain a nice list
00:51 - of all the videos and update as new
00:53 - videos get added so I plan to keep
00:55 - adding more and more things to this app
00:57 - as time goes on so it's meant to be a
00:59 - continuously updated app as I continue
01:01 - making videos and more interesting
01:03 - projects having a steam app also opens
01:05 - up a lot of possibilities with regards
01:07 - to what kind of cool projects I can make
01:09 - in the future so for example I could
01:11 - make some multiplayer tutorials and
01:13 - update the steam build so all you have
01:14 - to do is get it and we can all play
01:16 - around with some interesting cool
01:17 - minigames or I can also make it usable
01:20 - as an interface for some livestream
01:21 - games or simply have an easy way to keep
01:24 - adding all the completely and projects I
01:26 - make in one easy place so this opens up
01:29 - a lot of really cool possibilities for
01:31 - some interesting projects and
01:32 - interacting more with avi so again like
01:34 - I mentioned in the videos where I give
01:36 - advice to in developers wish lists are
01:38 - extremely important so please go to the
01:40 - link in description add it to your
01:41 - wishlist and phone doing so really helps
01:43 - in getting some visibility on Steam and
01:45 - when it comes out you won't be notified
01:47 - then the app won't be free alright so
01:49 - thanks again for watching all the videos

01:53 - hope this exciting project won't be very
01:55 - successful alright I'll see you next
