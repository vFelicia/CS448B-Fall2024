00:00 - uh right so please zone get rid of it
00:03 - and nope
00:05 - why did i what did i forget
00:09 - wait
00:11 - oh come on this is that issue
00:14 - oh i remember i remember having this
00:16 - issue
00:18 - quite a couple of years ago and drove me
00:19 - crazy right the issue is that unity
00:22 - doesn't actually refresh the
00:23 - parent-child relationship it doesn't
00:26 - refresh it right away so over here i'm
00:27 - calling destroy but when this ends this
00:30 - guy is still going to be a child of this
00:31 - one
00:32 - i'm pretty sure this is the issue
00:34 - because i'm pretty sure i went crazy
00:35 - with this issue at one point in the past
00:38 - so if i unparent it and then destroy it
00:41 - now the parent list should be correct i
00:43 - hope
00:44 - let me just delete that one there you go
00:46 - down there you go now it does work
00:48 - so that's the issue it's the issue
00:50 - that's drove me crazy so long
00:53 - but yep great there you go another
00:55 - perfect example of the power of
00:57 - experience that's the power of
00:59 - experience because i had
01:00 - that issue where if you destroy it it
01:03 - still counts as being a child so that is
01:04 - why i was doing a refresh then going
01:07 - through all the children and so on and
01:08 - was adding them again because this guy
01:10 - apparently still exists
01:12 - oh boy yeah that's annoying but
01:14 - thankfully yeah so if you ever try to
01:17 - destroy things always know that they're
01:19 - not actually destroyed at least when it
01:21 - comes to parent children relationships
01:24 - so what happened here is if you have a
01:26 - child object and you call destroy it's
01:28 - not really destroyed instantly it still
01:30 - exists and if you check the channel
01:32 - count or cycle through the children it's
01:33 - still there so if your logic is based on
01:36 - the assumption that the channel list is
01:37 - updated instantly just like i was doing
01:39 - here then everything breaks one solution
01:42 - is to manually unparent the object and
01:44 - then let unity destroy that object
01:45 - sometime in the future remember that so
01:47 - you don't go insane just like i did many
01:49 - years ago wondering why a supposedly
01:51 - destroyed object was still alive as a
01:53 - child
