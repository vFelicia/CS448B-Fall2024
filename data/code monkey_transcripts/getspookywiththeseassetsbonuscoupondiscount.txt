01:38 - next up if you're working in 2d here's
01:39 - some great isometric sprites i really
01:42 - like the art style on this one very
01:44 - clean drawings with some really nice
01:45 - outlines so maybe you could use this as
01:48 - a starting point in order to make
01:49 - something like a spooky stardew valley
01:51 - or maybe graveyard keeper if you're
01:53 - looking for something spooky but
01:55 - cartoony here's some nice skeletons
01:57 - they've got big heads and big eyes so
01:59 - they're both very spooky and very cute
02:02 - could be a great starting point for
02:03 - something like a halloween rts game then
02:06 - here's a pretty specific one a bunch of
02:08 - horror busts great models all very high
02:10 - res you could place the busts on top of
02:12 - pillars or hang them on the side kind of
02:14 - like gargoyles so these would be great
02:16 - for adding more variety to some spooky
02:18 - levels with a realistic art sound and if
02:20 - you want a complete environment here's
02:22 - one it's a scene with a graveyard and
02:24 - some nature looks like something that
02:26 - you could find in some ruins in a game
02:28 - like skyrim then if you want to expand
02:31 - upon that environment here's a bunch of
02:32 - dried trees they are very spooky and
02:35 - looking lots of variations you could
02:37 - build an entire forest just with this
02:38 - pack just add some basic fog and it
02:41 - already looks quite creepy and combined
02:43 - with the previous one here's a bunch of
02:44 - fences and gates
02:45 - lots of spikes and stone just these are
02:48 - enough to create a spooky ambience
02:50 - and then on top of that here's a bunch
02:52 - of flutter props these would be great
02:53 - for decoration or maybe some potion
02:55 - simulator game then of course we
02:57 - couldn't have a halloween sale without a
02:58 - bunch of zombies so here's a nice pack

03:02 - variations it's got pbr materials with
03:05 - some high-res textures
03:06 - and all the models are also set up with
03:08 - separate body parts in order to enable
03:10 - easily cutting limbs for something more
03:12 - fantastical here's a dragon skeleton
03:15 - just like the skeleton asset that i
03:16 - showed a while ago this one also has
03:18 - morphing so you can get tons of
03:20 - variations it looks really nice and also
03:22 - includes tons of animations then for a
03:24 - complete environment here is a nice
03:26 - cartoony village it's a pretty good art
03:28 - sound could be a village on a top-down
03:30 - action game or maybe just use the
03:32 - buildings and make something like a city
03:34 - builder or an rts the buildings also
03:36 - have some nice variation including with
03:38 - some snow then if you want something
