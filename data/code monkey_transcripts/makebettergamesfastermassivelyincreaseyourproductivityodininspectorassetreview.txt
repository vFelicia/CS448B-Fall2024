00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and this is the odin inspector
00:04 - it's one of the very best tools you can
00:05 - get to enhance your workflow in unity
00:07 - and help you make better games even
00:09 - faster
00:10 - this video is played in two parts first
00:12 - let's look at some of the demos to see
00:13 - what the asset can do and how they work
00:15 - and then after that i'll do a
00:16 - step-by-step guide on how to start using
00:18 - it and add it to your own games
00:20 - check out the entire playlist where i
00:21 - highlight great assets to help you make
00:23 - your games awesome
00:24 - and as always there's a link to the
00:25 - asset in the description and as a bonus
00:27 - you can use the coupon code monkey10 to
00:28 - get 10 off your
00:30 - order so odin inspector it's one of the
00:32 - highest rated assets on the assets or
00:34 - and for a very good reason
00:35 - this is one of those tools that if you
00:37 - use it right it can have a drastic
00:39 - improvement in your productivity
00:40 - and of course the more productive you
00:42 - are the less time it takes you to make
00:44 - your game which lowers your cost which
00:45 - in turn makes it easier to achieve
00:47 - profitability
00:48 - so definitely don't underestimate the
00:50 - power of good tools to help you work
00:51 - better
00:52 - unity is an extremely powerful engine
00:53 - not just for making games but also for
00:55 - building tools for making those games
00:57 - the unity editor is extremely
00:59 - customizable
01:00 - i've already covered how you can create
01:02 - custom editor windows with fancy buttons
01:04 - and so on
01:05 - if you put in the time you can
01:06 - definitely do some amazing things
01:07 - however the issue is that whole process
01:10 - is extremely laborious with tons of
01:12 - boilerplate code that you need to write
01:13 - in order to get just a single custom
01:15 - thing showing
01:16 - for me the most complex custom editor i
01:18 - made was probably the one for the
01:20 - crafting system
01:20 - just some buttons and object references
01:22 - positioned in a specific way and even
01:24 - though it's simple it still took a lot
01:26 - of work to make
01:27 - so writing custom unity editors is
01:28 - extremely powerful but not easy to use
01:30 - at all
01:31 - that's where odin inspector comes in it
01:33 - makes that process extremely painless
01:35 - and super easy to use
01:36 - being able to easily build tools is one
01:38 - of those things that can make or break
01:39 - your productivity which in turn can be
01:41 - the deciding factor between making
01:43 - profitable or
01:44 - unprofitable games one huge difference
01:46 - is how when making custom editors you
01:48 - need to create a separate script
01:50 - put it on an editor folder and write
01:52 - tons of code with odin however
01:54 - you'll literally just add an attribute
01:55 - directly above the field that's it
01:57 - as you may know the more files you have
01:59 - in your codebase the harder it is to
02:00 - maintain
02:01 - so just that change going from two
02:03 - separate files with tons of boilerplate
02:05 - code going to a single file with a
02:07 - single attribute
02:08 - that change alone makes this asset more
02:10 - than worth it by the way if you find the
02:12 - video helpful
02:13 - please hit the like button it's a tiny
02:14 - thing but really does help
02:16 - thanks so over here i've got my unity
02:18 - project and i've imported the package
02:20 - since this asset is all about making
02:22 - really nice editors naturally they have
02:24 - a really good getting started window
02:26 - just go up here into tools odin
02:28 - inspector getting started
02:30 - and here you see this real nice window
02:32 - and you can access all of the
02:33 - information that you need as you can see
02:35 - it's very very
02:36 - detailed every one of these buttons
02:38 - opens more windows with even more data
02:40 - so you can really learn how it works and
02:41 - to see it in action down here they have
02:43 - a really awesome rpg sample project
02:46 - just click on the open window and out
02:48 - pops out the window
02:49 - so this is a window that was created
02:51 - with odin inspector and it's fully
02:52 - functional so you can move it you can
02:54 - dock it you can resize it
02:55 - and as name implies this is a sample for
02:58 - an rpg game
02:59 - so by selecting any of these objects you
03:01 - can see all the things that you can
03:02 - easily create with odin
03:04 - so for example here you've got a simple
03:06 - image with an object selector
03:08 - you've got text boxes so you can input
03:09 - the name you've got a bunch of sliders
03:11 - over here a bunch of things that you can
03:13 - select then you've got a matrix where
03:15 - you can click and drag various objects
03:18 - you've got the objects themselves
03:19 - showing an icon as well as an amount
03:21 - then you've also got these really nice
03:23 - tabs so it constantly switches between
03:25 - what you want to see
03:26 - over here on the stats you also see a
03:28 - bunch of sliders so this is the
03:30 - display for the characters then down
03:32 - here this way for the armors
03:34 - so again shows a really nice image some
03:36 - text block a drop down menu for the type
03:38 - then some text areas so you can input
03:40 - multiple lines
03:42 - and over here a simple list so you can
03:44 - add various things
03:45 - and of course up here you've got buttons
03:46 - to create a new item or anything
03:48 - all the data behind this is stored in
03:50 - scriptable objects
03:52 - i've covered them in detail in another
03:53 - video and if you've worked with
03:55 - scriptable objects then you know they
03:56 - are excellent for storing data
03:58 - but by default they show their data in
04:00 - the inspector using normal fields
04:02 - so none of these fancy sliders and
04:03 - images and all of this is included in
04:06 - the project files
04:07 - so in this case over here under demos
04:09 - under the rpg editor you can see that
04:11 - so for example here is a character and i
04:13 - can double click
04:14 - and up here is the script and how it all
04:16 - works so you can inspect all these
04:18 - attributes to see how everything is made
04:20 - i'm going to cover how these attributes
04:22 - work in a bit now to see the massive
04:24 - difference that this makes
04:25 - i can for example take this inspector
04:27 - which is showing it a weapon
04:28 - then just swap it out for a debug
04:30 - inspector which makes it look pretty
04:32 - close to the default inspector so here
04:33 - you can see the huge difference
04:35 - so this is just a bunch of fields a
04:37 - bunch of tabs a bunch of things
04:38 - whereas over here we've got some really
04:40 - nice really nicely organized so all the
04:42 - stats modifiers the icon and so on
04:44 - so both of them are displaying the same
04:46 - underlying data but obviously one is
04:48 - much more easy to work with
04:49 - so this demo that they show here is
04:51 - really awesome this really showcases the
04:53 - power of this tool
04:54 - you can imagine if you were working on
04:56 - an rpg just how much more productive you
04:58 - would be setting all the data of your
05:00 - game
05:00 - in this custom window as opposed to
05:02 - setting it in the default inspector
05:04 - as i said the main point of this asset
05:05 - is making all this super easy
05:07 - new building this from scratch using a
05:09 - custom editor would likely take weeks
05:11 - but with odin inspector you might build
05:13 - this in just one or two days
05:15 - the way it works is all based on
05:16 - attributes and thankfully over here on
05:18 - the getting start window you can open
05:20 - the attributes overview
05:21 - and over here you can see all of the
05:23 - attributes used along with the code and
05:25 - what they look like
05:27 - so for example over here on the preview
05:28 - you see acetone you see this nice title
05:30 - so how do you make that it's just very
05:32 - simple it's right down here
05:33 - you just use the title attribute and
05:35 - that's it looks like that so you can
05:36 - browse around all of these to see all
05:38 - these attributes
05:39 - as you can see you've got custom value
05:41 - drawers you got some delayed properties
05:43 - you got an info box you've got tons of
05:45 - colors
05:46 - you can make something searchable you
05:48 - can make all kinds of buttons
05:50 - you can display various dictionaries
05:52 - various lists various things
05:54 - you even have some really awesome ifs so
05:57 - if something then show a different thing
05:59 - so this is very useful then you got all
06:01 - kinds of groups so you can really
06:03 - organize it exactly as you want it
06:05 - then a bunch of numbers a bunch of bars
06:06 - and so on and again the whole point of
06:08 - this is that it's all super simple
06:10 - most of these you just add a single
06:12 - attribute and it's done so for example
06:14 - over here on the button
06:15 - you can see how do you make a button
06:16 - well that's it you just use the
06:18 - attribute button and that's it you've
06:19 - got a button that it fully works
06:21 - and as i said you can inspect these
06:22 - scripts used to make the rpg demo
06:25 - so you can inspect all of this and see
06:26 - how they all work so for example on the
06:28 - items how did they show an item they use
06:30 - the preview field they have the level
06:32 - and so on
06:32 - so back in the getting started window
06:34 - here we see a bunch of examples for
06:36 - editor windows
06:37 - so you can inherit from odin editor
06:39 - window instead of the
06:40 - basic unity editor window so this
06:42 - enables you to use the same attributes
06:44 - without having to write custom editor
06:45 - code
06:46 - then here is a great demo on how to
06:48 - inspect objects so for example you can
06:50 - make a button so that you can click on
06:51 - it and it shows up some more detailed
06:53 - information on a specific object
06:55 - again you can inspect the code to see
06:56 - how all of this works then you can
06:58 - create your own custom menus
07:00 - so this is exactly the same thing that
07:02 - you saw on the rpg demo so you've got
07:04 - all these tabs on the left side and all
07:05 - the data on the right side
07:06 - then over here you've got some more
07:08 - examples on custom drawers
07:10 - so this is an example scene where you
07:11 - got all these objects on them with
07:13 - various scripts
07:13 - so for example just a basic health bar
07:15 - with a visual display
07:17 - then over here a custom drawer
07:18 - showcasing a custom struct
07:20 - then you can also add some options for
07:22 - right clicking so here just set a
07:23 - certain color
07:24 - you can create custom drawers for
07:26 - generic classes very useful
07:28 - you can add some validation to make sure
07:29 - that your films have the correct values
07:31 - and then over here it's showcasing how
07:34 - you can even have
07:35 - a fully working mindsweeper game so here
07:37 - this is all running the inspector and
07:39 - works
07:39 - exactly right so you've got the game of
07:42 - minesweeper
07:47 - so yeah there you go as you can see it
07:48 - fully works and then you've got a final
07:51 - advanced demo
07:52 - so these are more advanced use cases for
07:55 - example one of the things you can do is
07:56 - build custom editors
07:58 - on top of things where you don't have
07:59 - direct access to the code
08:01 - like here for example is a custom editor
08:03 - built to showcase the matrix 4x4
08:05 - type and finally of course down here
08:07 - you've got all kinds of links so the
08:09 - manual the documentation roadmap
08:11 - issues support as well as the discord
08:13 - channel alright so hopefully by now you
08:15 - already have some ideas for how you
08:17 - could use this to make some awesome
08:18 - tools to massively increase your
08:20 - productivity
08:21 - if you want to learn even more on how to
08:23 - use odin you can check out their
08:24 - official youtube channel
08:26 - they've got tons of tutorial videos that
08:27 - will help you get the most out of this
08:29 - tool
08:29 - so now let's see a practical example of
08:31 - how to use it
08:32 - now a while ago i made my factory
08:35 - automation minigame
08:36 - and in making that game one of the data
08:38 - objects that i had to create were some
08:40 - items so i made them a scriptable object
08:42 - and here is all of my various items
08:44 - so here they are without any custom
08:46 - inspectors so this is the default way
08:48 - that it shows up
08:49 - definitely not very usable so let's
08:51 - spend just a few minutes making this
08:53 - inspector infinitely better
08:55 - all i have to do is just open up my
08:56 - scriptable object so here is the script
08:59 - very simple just a bunch of fields and
09:00 - create acid menu pretty much all basic
09:03 - so first we need to add the using
09:05 - statement so using
09:06 - sirenix sirenix.odinspector and once you
09:09 - do now we have access to the various
09:11 - attributes
09:12 - so let's begin by making the sprite have
09:14 - a proper preview so we can see it
09:16 - so over here just before the sprite film
09:18 - we're going to add the attribute
09:20 - preview field and then inside we can add
09:22 - the height
09:24 - so let's put a height of 16 and yep
09:26 - there it is much better
09:28 - so it's a sprite over here i can even
09:30 - click to select it
09:31 - so i can select and select the different
09:33 - sprites and there you go it selects
09:35 - now we don't really need the label so
09:37 - just having the preview is more than
09:38 - enough
09:39 - and here you can add multiple attributes
09:41 - by simply adding a comma so in this case
09:43 - let's hide the label so just put
09:45 - hide and label and if there it is just a
09:47 - nice preview no label everything looks
09:48 - great okay so now it wouldn't look
09:51 - better if we position the item
09:53 - icon on the left side and all these
09:55 - films on the right side
09:56 - so for that let's create a horizontal
09:58 - group with the same size as the preview
10:01 - so use the attribute horizontal group
10:04 - let's give it a name let's call it
10:05 - split just to split between the left and
10:07 - right side and for the size let's put a
10:09 - size of 6 in
10:11 - okay so that one is now on the left side
10:13 - now we want to place the other ones on
10:15 - the right side
10:16 - and we're going to want those to be
10:18 - grouped vertically
10:19 - so for that let's go down into the next
10:21 - field and in here we're going to add a
10:23 - vertical group
10:24 - but we do want these to be inside the
10:26 - horizontal group
10:28 - so the way we do that is over here in
10:30 - the name we give it the same name so
10:32 - we are also on the split then use a
10:34 - forward slash kind of like a folder name
10:37 - and then let's say just right and if
10:39 - there it is now the item name shows up
10:41 - on the right side to the right of the
10:42 - actual sprite
10:43 - okay now the label is a bit too big so
10:46 - there's a lot of wasted space here so we
10:47 - can also set the size for that one
10:49 - so for example put the label on width
10:53 - and let's put it say 120 and yep now
10:55 - that's a much better size
10:56 - and now for the others let's just put
10:58 - them on the same vertical group as the
11:00 - item name so they show up beneath it
11:02 - so in here let's just copy paste this
11:04 - one onto this one and this one
11:06 - and yep there it is now here we can also
11:08 - still use just the basic default unity
11:11 - custom editor code
11:12 - so for example over here for the mining
11:14 - timer let's add a range
11:16 - let's put a minimum of 0 and a maximum
11:19 - of let's say 10.
11:20 - and yeah there you go now the mining
11:22 - timer does have a sliding variable
11:24 - then for example here i added some
11:26 - buttons to set the stack amount to
11:27 - certain values
11:28 - so i can still use the checkbox in order
11:30 - to set to a fixed value
11:32 - or use these buttons to easily set it so
11:34 - for these ones i wanted to put them
11:35 - organized horizontally so for that i
11:38 - create another horizontal group to
11:39 - hold the stack amount and then just put
11:42 - the buttons on the same horizontal group
11:44 - so they show up
11:44 - left right here and then for the buttons
11:46 - it's very simple just use the button
11:48 - give it some text if you want
11:49 - and then underneath it put the actual
11:51 - function that you want to call so in
11:53 - this case then the function simply just
11:54 - changes the field
11:55 - so here are some buttons a slider a
11:58 - checkbox and some really nice icon
12:00 - selector
12:01 - alright so with this very simple example
12:03 - you can already see just how far you can
12:04 - push this
12:05 - if you're going to work on a project for
12:07 - a decent amount of time then it
12:08 - definitely makes sense to spend
12:10 - some time just making some good tools so
12:12 - you can greatly increase your
12:14 - productivity
12:14 - so that's the odin inspector an
12:16 - extremely powerful tool that has the
12:18 - ability to greatly increase your
12:19 - productivity to make
12:20 - better games faster it's one of the top
12:23 - assets on the asset store and for a very
12:24 - good reason
12:25 - as always there's a link to the asset in
12:27 - the description and as a bonus you can
