00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here's a super quick video of a
00:04 - feature that won't pretty much always
00:05 - improve the look of your game
00:07 - this feature used to exist but then was
00:09 - removed and finally was added back in
00:11 - with unity 2020 which is the version
00:13 - that just recently went into lts you set
00:16 - it in a weird place so some of you might
00:17 - not even know that this was added
00:19 - so for example here is a scene this is
00:21 - from the polygon city asset pack
00:24 - it looks pretty good all the models look
00:25 - pretty great everything looks great
00:27 - so this is how it looks by default and
00:30 - as soon as i enable it
00:32 - if there you go it looks quite a bit
00:33 - better so here is on
00:35 - off and on so what i'm talking about
00:38 - here is called ambient occlusion
00:40 - specifically screen space i mean
00:42 - occlusion
00:42 - what it does is it gives a bit of shadow
00:44 - where there's some geometry
00:46 - so for example on all of these corners
00:48 - in the city you can see as i toggle it
00:50 - yep there you go you get a bit of shadow
00:52 - so the whole thing seems to have
00:54 - a bit more depth same thing over here on
00:56 - the cars without even the collision
00:58 - you can't even tell the car interior but
01:01 - if i enable it if there you go all like
01:02 - that
01:03 - so again what it does is gives a bit of
01:05 - shadow where there's some geometry
01:07 - so it makes it look especially great
01:08 - where the scene is already in the shadow
01:11 - so if i disable it all of these objects
01:13 - that are currently within the sun shadow
01:15 - none of them get any extra shadows so
01:17 - the whole thing seems very flat
01:19 - and with it enabled yep it looks so much
01:22 - better
01:22 - so it makes the whole scene feel much
01:24 - more grounded and i think it makes
01:26 - pretty much every scene look better
01:27 - unless you're going for a very specific
01:29 - channelless look
01:30 - now previously this was available in the
01:33 - old post-processing stack
01:34 - so in the package post-processing v2 it
01:37 - exists as an effect
01:38 - but when unity changed to the universal
01:40 - rendered pipeline it came with a new
01:42 - post crossing stack and ambient
01:44 - occlusion was not included as one effect
01:46 - but as i said now with urp version 10 it
01:49 - does have immune occlusion
01:51 - however again if you go into post
01:52 - processing and over here i've got my
01:54 - volume script so this is where you add
01:56 - all the normal effects so i've got a
01:57 - color adjustment and something yet
01:59 - so some very basic post processing
02:01 - however if i go into add another
02:03 - override go inside
02:04 - and nope over here i do not see anything
02:07 - related to
02:08 - eminent occlusion so it has been added
02:10 - but now it's in a different place
02:12 - now the first thing you need is make
02:13 - sure you are using the universal render
02:15 - pipeline version 10 or above
02:17 - if you're using unity 2020 then that's
02:19 - the version it should install
02:21 - then with erp as you know you've got the
02:23 - universal render pipeline asset here it
02:25 - is with all these settings
02:26 - and then you need to select the actual
02:28 - render object and then over here you see
02:30 - the renderer feature so it's in here you
02:32 - click on add a new one and over here you
02:34 - see right away the screen space and mint
02:36 - occlusion
02:36 - so here it is and you can play around
02:38 - all these parameters so increase the
02:40 - radius like that that's way too intense
02:42 - so you can play around with all these
02:43 - values this is a real-time effect so
02:45 - it's really simple to see
02:47 - the changes happen in real time so there
02:49 - it is looking great
02:51 - also since it's a renderer feature it
02:53 - means that it works separate from the
02:54 - volume system
02:55 - so that means that it doesn't work with
02:57 - any of the volume bounds or weight or
02:59 - any of that
03:00 - so i can completely disable post
03:02 - pressing and yep i still got ambient
03:03 - occlusion
03:04 - so that's a good thing because for this
03:06 - effect you really wouldn't want a
03:07 - different intensity in different places
03:09 - and now just in case some of you are
03:11 - wondering there is another type of
03:12 - ambient occlusion
03:13 - this one as it says here it is a screen
03:15 - space image occlusion
03:17 - so it works based on what the camera
03:19 - sees and nothing else so
03:20 - objects outside of the camera are not
03:22 - considered when rendering this effect
03:24 - but the other type of image occlusion
03:26 - that you might be familiar with is the
03:27 - one with baked lighting so if you go
03:29 - into window
03:30 - go into rendering and lighting in here
03:33 - on the light mapper settings you can go
03:35 - down here
03:36 - and see indeed ambient occlusion so you
03:38 - can enable this and there you go set on
03:39 - settings
03:40 - so this setting has always been here but
03:42 - making the lights only works for static
03:44 - objects
03:45 - so you first scene has tons of static
03:46 - objects like for example these buildings
03:48 - then this type of image occlusion does
03:50 - work great but if all these cars were
03:52 - moving then you couldn't use back
03:53 - lighting for them so that's where the
03:55 - standard screen space
03:56 - aiming occlusion comes in so it works on
03:58 - everything like your player
04:00 - moving cars moving objects moving
04:02 - anything it makes all the objects feel
04:03 - much more grounded
04:05 - and in terms of performance over here
04:07 - you can simply down sample
04:09 - so just take this and it will run much
04:11 - better or over here on the source
04:13 - instead of that normal is just going to
04:14 - depth then you define the normal
04:16 - quantity you want so you can go down to
04:18 - low and for the sample count you can
04:19 - also bring it all the way down
04:21 - so even if you're targeting some low end
04:23 - mobile devices you can also include this
04:25 - as a nice setting
04:26 - so i said this was now added back in unt
04:28 - 2020 so now that 2020 is in lts this is
04:31 - the version that i will be using going
04:33 - forward
04:33 - so it's awesome to finally be able to
04:35 - use this effect once again
04:37 - i really think this makes pretty much
04:38 - every scene look better here is the demo
04:41 - again with off
04:42 - on off on so it looks great definitely
04:45 - look forward to some more bet on looking
04:46 - videos in the future
04:47 - all right i hope you found this quick
04:49 - video useful thanks to these awesome
04:51 - patreon supporters for making these
04:53 - videos possible
04:54 - thank you for watching and i'll see you
04:55 - next time
