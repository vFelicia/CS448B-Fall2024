00:02 - hi there this is a quick tip for how to
00:04 - free your code from magic numbers now
00:07 - one very important concept in writing
00:08 - clean code is never using magic numbers
00:11 - magic numbers are numbers which are used
00:13 - without being clear about what they're
00:15 - doing so I have some code in here a
00:17 - simple unit class it has a basic update
00:20 - and running this code now in here I'm
00:22 - increasing the position by this vector
00:25 - multiplied by this amount and then I'm
00:27 - doing a distance check and seeing if
00:29 - it's under 5f this is some simple code
00:32 - so you might be able to figure out what
00:34 - it means but still it should be clear
00:36 - what the code is doing so the
00:37 - subtraction here is getting the
00:39 - direction vector towards our target
00:41 - position the 20 here signifies our
00:44 - movement speed and the 5 F is the attack
00:46 - distance so essentially he's moving this
00:48 - unit towards this target at 20 units per
00:51 - second and if he gets within 5 units he
00:54 - won't execute an attack so we can make
00:56 - this code much more readable by simply
00:58 - defining variables for each of these
01:00 - numbers so in here the first thing we
01:02 - get a vector 3 for the move direction
01:04 - and move Direction is this in here so we
01:07 - replace this with moved ear
01:09 - ok then the 20 F represents our movement
01:13 - speed so we replace that and finally our
01:19 - 5 F in here represents our attack
01:21 - distance so the final code for the
01:23 - attack distance and use that instead so
01:27 - the code now has more lines but it is
01:28 - much more readable we can clearly see
01:31 - that we are increasing the position by
01:32 - the direction multiplied by a movement
01:34 - speed and here testing for the distance
01:36 - if it is within our attack distance and
01:38 - if these numbers were being used
01:40 - elsewhere then we would also have
01:42 - various instances of 20 F and 5 F
01:45 - without being connected to one another
01:46 - so in that case we should define these
01:48 - as member variables so everyone uses the
01:51 - same variable so always remember to keep
01:53 - your code clean by defining clear
01:54 - variables instead of using magic numbers
01:56 - and that's it hope you found this tip
01:59 - useful alright see you next time
