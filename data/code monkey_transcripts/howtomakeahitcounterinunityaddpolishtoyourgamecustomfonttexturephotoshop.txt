00:00 - in this video we're going to create a
00:01 - nice hit counter to show the number of
00:03 - successful hits it will increase in
00:05 - intensity with the more hits we have and
00:07 - reset when the player gets hit let's
00:09 - begin hello and welcome I'm your code
00:19 - monkey and this channel is all about
00:20 - helping you will learn how to make your
00:22 - own games with and after torrents made
00:24 - by a professional indie game developer
00:25 - so if you find the video helpful
00:26 - consider subscribing okay so this is
00:29 - what we want to create I have my player
00:31 - character here that I can move around
00:32 - and attack and when I hit an enemy there
00:35 - we go as you can see there's a little
00:36 - counter showing the number of hits that
00:38 - I have successfully don't the counter
00:41 - goes up it changes color and it shakes
00:43 - with some very nice intensity now if I
00:46 - do get hit there you go the counter
00:48 - resets back to zero and we have to keep
00:50 - hitting enemies in order to make it
00:52 - increase this is a really cool element
00:55 - and very much like the hit counter that
00:57 - I used in hyper nights so you can check
00:59 - that game out to see the final effect in
01:01 - action
01:01 - it's a very simple element but also
01:03 - externally satisfying we're going to
01:06 - start off by making just the text
01:08 - element and the script to handle it then
01:10 - when we have the illogic fully working
01:12 - we're going to polish up the effect by
01:13 - adding shake size increase and a color
01:16 - change so watch the whole video to see
01:18 - the full creation of the final effect
01:20 - alright let's get to it so here we are
01:24 - in our starting scene I have a character
01:26 - that I can move around and there are
01:27 - enemies being spawn I can hit and kill
01:30 - them and there you go after three hits
01:32 - they die and they are constantly being
01:34 - spawned and attacking me so right now
01:38 - you can already see the massive
01:39 - difference that not having the effect
01:41 - mix the game looks much less impactful
01:43 - so let's get to work on making the head
01:46 - counter here in the editor and let's
01:48 - first go into the player object and
01:50 - inside we're going to place the head
01:52 - counter text so we go in here and we
01:55 - create a new text mesh object let's name
01:59 - this the hit counter text mesh Pro and
02:02 - while it's located above the player
02:11 - okay let's test to see if it's in the
02:13 - correct position with the correct size
02:15 - and if it sounds just about right it's
02:18 - there on the up and to the right okay
02:20 - good now that we have the text mesh
02:22 - correctly located let's make it look
02:25 - good by using a nice custom font so over
02:28 - here I have this custom font I then
02:31 - convert it into a front asset to be used
02:33 - by the text mesh Pro then I extracted
02:36 - this texture and modified it to have
02:38 - some nice effects as you can see it has
02:40 - a nice gradient and an outline to learn
02:42 - how to use custom font textures check
02:44 - out the link in the description for the
02:46 - video where I cover how to use custom
02:47 - fonts in text mesh Pro in that video I
02:50 - also cover how to extract the font
02:52 - texture Atlas so you can modify it in
02:54 - any image program to add effects like
02:56 - for example the gradient and outline in
02:58 - this one so let's use this font here on
03:01 - the text message pro and we simply drag
03:03 - our font asset into down and there you
03:05 - go that's what the font plots like so
03:07 - let's try again and if there's our head
03:10 - counter with a very nice custom font now
03:13 - as we hit the enemies we want the Texas
03:16 - play the current hit count and as the
03:18 - hit count goes up we also want to change
03:20 - the color size and polish our text all
03:22 - right so let's see how we're going to
03:24 - write the code for that first thing we
03:26 - need is obviously a script to handle it
03:28 - so let's go here make a new C sharp
03:30 - script this will be our hit counter and
03:32 - let's drag it onto the our text mesh Pro
03:35 - here's our object and just drag the
03:38 - script onto it okay now in here the
03:41 - first thing we need is to wear reference
03:43 - to our text mesh and ponen so we make a
03:45 - private text Metro which is inside the
03:48 - using TM Pro and we grab it on our
03:54 - private void away
03:58 - okay we have the reference to our
04:00 - component now we need a function to set
04:03 - our current counter so let's make a
04:05 - front void set hit counter and we
04:08 - receive an int for the hit count inside
04:12 - all we do is set the text so we go into
04:14 - the text mesh Pro and set our text to be
04:18 - our head count dot two string okay
04:22 - that's it these are our basics now let's
04:25 - make a simple test
04:27 - let's try showing the counter constantly
04:29 - increasing so over here on the awake
04:31 - let's create a function periodic this is
04:35 - part of the code mock utilities that you
04:37 - can grab for free from unity code monkey
04:38 - calm this class lets me trigger an
04:42 - action every certain amount of time so
04:44 - it's perfect for this testing so in here
04:47 - every certain amount of time we're going
04:48 - to trigger this action let's say every
04:51 - half a second so now inside this action
04:53 - let's define a hit count start off at
04:56 - zero and every half a second we're going
04:58 - to execute this code so we increase the
05:01 - head count and then we do set head
05:03 - counter to our head count okay so every
05:06 - half a second we're going to increase it
05:08 - and update our text so let's see here we
05:12 - are and the up as you can see the
05:13 - counter is indeed going up over time
05:15 - okay great so we have a simple visual
05:18 - hit counter that we can update to
05:20 - display any number now let's see how
05:22 - we're going to apply it to our player
05:24 - over here is the player class now the
05:27 - way it works isn't relevant to creating
05:30 - the hit counter all we know is when the
05:32 - player hidden in me and when he got hit
05:34 - and for that appear we have these nice
05:37 - events which provide everything that we
05:39 - need again always remember to keep your
05:41 - code as cleanly separated as possible we
05:44 - want the hit counter element to be
05:46 - completely decoupled from whatever
05:47 - implementation of the player that we
05:49 - have that way as we build our head
05:51 - counter we can use it with any sort of
05:53 - system and use it in various games all
05:56 - the hit counter needs to know are these
05:57 - events and the player doesn't need to
05:59 - know anything about the hit counter so
06:02 - we can go into the hit counter script
06:04 - and here first we need a reference to
06:06 - the player so let's go up here make a
06:08 - serialize field for the private player
06:13 - here in the editor we just drag our
06:15 - player reference okay now that we have
06:18 - the reference let's go up here into a
06:20 - private voice start and we're going to
06:23 - subscribe to our players events in this
06:26 - case just to keep things simple let's
06:27 - subscribe to the on attacked event this
06:30 - one is fired whenever the player does an
06:32 - attack regardless of whether he hits an
06:33 - enemy or not so it's perfect for our
06:36 - testing so when this event is triggered
06:39 - we want to increase the head counter so
06:41 - let's go up here to define a private end
06:44 - for the hit count and we can remove our
06:48 - temporary testing code okay and now in
06:52 - here when the player fires this event we
06:53 - just increase our hit count and we set
06:56 - the hit counter to this hit count and
07:00 - that's pretty much it so we are
07:02 - subscribing to the event we don't care
07:05 - how to play fires ever event all we need
07:07 - is that he does indeed fire it and when
07:09 - he does we increase the headcount and we
07:11 - update the text so let's test so here we
07:15 - are and you can already see a slight
07:17 - issue the hit counter is still saying
07:19 - the default text so we need to sort that
07:21 - out but first let's test out the hits if
07:24 - I attack even without hitting any of
07:25 - them if there you go one two three four
07:28 - five and so on so as you can see the hit
07:30 - counter is correctly and listening to
07:32 - those events and increasing the hit
07:34 - counter whenever they do regardless of
07:36 - whether I hit an enemy or not and as you
07:38 - know it keeps going up up up and you
07:40 - know exactly okay great so far so good
07:43 - now let's go back into the code first
07:46 - let's fix our default text issue so in
07:50 - here we make a function a private void
07:52 - hide hit counter and on we're going to
07:57 - do is disable the mesh renderer which is
07:59 - what the text my shoes is to display it
08:00 - so let's go up here to grab our
08:03 - reference to the mesh renderer
08:08 - and here we just said it to enable as
08:11 - false and when we set the head counter
08:15 - we set it back to true ok and now up
08:18 - here on our way
08:20 - what we need is stall hide our hit
08:22 - counter ok that's it let's test and yep
08:27 - the counter is sitting by the phone this
08:28 - one is I attack it becomes visible ok
08:31 - great now let's listen to the on damage
08:33 - event so we can reset the hit counter
08:35 - whenever the player takes damage so here
08:37 - only need to do subscribe to the on
08:39 - damaged event and when the player takes
08:43 - damage when it takes damage we set the
08:48 - hit count back to zero and we hide our
08:51 - head count ok that's pretty much it for
08:53 - our reset again we don't care how the
08:56 - player implements this event
08:57 - all we care is that he fires it so let's
08:59 - test so here we are let's do some hits
09:01 - yep there you go I got a hit counter of
09:03 - 5 and now if I get hit if there your
09:07 - reset and now I'm back to 1
09:09 - so get hit goes there and going up get
09:13 - hit resets and when I get hit it always
09:16 - reset ok awesome so we can now increase
09:19 - our head count and also reset it when we
09:22 - do take a hit now let's finalize the
09:24 - logic to make the hit counter properly
09:26 - work on our attacks so for the events as
09:30 - you can see we have on enemy hit and on
09:32 - enemy killed we're going to use both of
09:35 - them in order to give a bonus when the
09:37 - enemy gets killed so before we do that
09:39 - let's clean our code by making a
09:41 - function to increase our head counter so
09:43 - a convoy increase hit count and in here
09:48 - we just do what we were doing in here
09:50 - and on this one we can still call it
09:54 - even though we're not going to subscribe
09:55 - to the on attacked is only for testing
09:58 - so we can comment that out and now in
10:00 - here
10:01 - let's subscribe to the player dot on
10:03 - enemy hit so this one gets triggered
10:07 - when the player hits an enemy
10:10 - when he does hit an enemy we increase
10:12 - the headcount then we have the player on
10:16 - enemy kill so here the player killed an
10:22 - enemy and here we increase the hit count
10:26 - as well so essentially on the killing
10:29 - blow we had two hits instead of just one
10:31 - so we got a nice small bonus for killing
10:33 - an enemy so let's test and see if the
10:36 - logic is all completely working here we
10:38 - are with zero now if I attack nothing
10:40 - yep nothing happens now if I hit this
10:42 - enemy one yep there you go two three any
10:45 - of there you go he hit four because he
10:47 - had a bonus on the killing hit one two
10:48 - three four
10:49 - yep exactly okay awesome so all of our
10:52 - logic is working we are increasing by
10:54 - one per attack getting a bonus for a
10:56 - killing blow and we still reset if we
10:59 - get hit okay awesome
11:00 - so our logic is fully working exactly as
11:03 - intended now it's time to punish
11:05 - yourself to make it look really cool so
11:07 - the first thing we're going to do is a
11:09 - common change we want to convert to
11:11 - change based on certain thresholds so as
11:14 - the hit counter increases it looks more
11:16 - and more special let's see so we go down
11:19 - into the set hit counter function and
11:21 - here we just do some very simple ifs
11:31 - okay so here we have a bunch of simple
11:34 - lives just testing if the hit count is
11:35 - above certain thresholds and applying a
11:38 - certain color I'm using this function
11:41 - from the utilities which allows me to
11:42 - convert a hexadecimal code into a color
11:44 - so this is much simpler to understand so
11:47 - after we define our text color all we
11:49 - need is to apply it to our text so our
11:52 - text mesh set the color to this text
11:56 - color okay let's see ok here we are with
12:01 - no hits now let's hit okay with four we
12:04 - still got just our basic white text and
12:06 - yep now it turned blue after 10 now
12:09 - let's see after 20 there you go a nice
12:11 - green now let's see after 30 yep we got
12:14 - a nice yellow
12:15 - where's more enemies and hit him and 40
12:18 - we got an orange
12:20 - and after 50 if there you go we had a
12:23 - nice thing and everything looks very
12:25 - nice very special and if we take damage
12:27 - there go back to zero back to white back
12:30 - to increasing okay awesome
12:32 - so we have successfully added different
12:34 - colors dependent on the number of hits
12:36 - all right now for another effect let's
12:39 - increase the size as the hit counter
12:40 - goes up so to increase the size we have
12:43 - two options we can do simple ifs like we
12:45 - did in here in order to make specific
12:47 - thresholds or we can increase the phone
12:49 - by a tiny bit per every single hit so
12:52 - let's try the second approach and here
12:55 - we find a color for the font size and by
12:59 - default we're starting off at 7f and now
13:02 - we need to design how much the font will
13:03 - increase per hit so in here a note for
13:07 - the pircuit font size and let's put it
13:10 - that point zero seven f so the font size
13:13 - won't double after a hundred hits then
13:16 - all we do is set the font size on the
13:18 - text match pro okay let you do it let's
13:24 - see so here we are let's see the font
13:27 - size on the first hit and there we go we
13:29 - still got the normal size and let's see
13:30 - if it increases as the hits get higher
13:34 - and we'd sixteen you come on rate see
13:35 - that it's quite a bit bigger and quite a
13:38 - bit bigger and once it reaches 50 it
13:40 - should be quite large and keep
13:42 - increasing 30-40 and as you can see it's
13:45 - definitely bigger and 48 and 50 and yep
13:48 - it's quite big okay so this looks good
13:51 - we should probably add a sort of upper
13:54 - limit but the illogic looks good now for
13:57 - a final effect let's also make the hit
13:59 - counter shake whenever we hit an enemy
14:01 - and then slowdown back to zero okay
14:03 - let's see
14:09 - so here is our limit we're just doing a
14:12 - simple clamp we take what we're going to
14:14 - only put a minimum on the starting and a
14:16 - maximum on the double
14:17 - okay now for the shake we want to be
14:21 - just a simple shake so that means we're
14:23 - just going to move the position around a
14:25 - bit so let's make a update to do our
14:27 - animation then here a press Boyd update
14:30 - now in here we want to modify the little
14:33 - composition so first let's go up here
14:36 - and make the private vector3 we're going
14:38 - to store our base local position and we
14:42 - grab it on our awake okay so we have our
14:47 - base law composition now here on our
14:50 - update we set our current transformed
14:53 - optimal composition we set it to be
14:56 - based on our baisemeaux composition and
14:58 - then we add a random direction so in
15:01 - here making a vector3
15:02 - for the random direction so we have a
15:09 - random direction and we add it by that
15:12 - now we don't want to add just a static
15:15 - magnitude we want to have a varying
15:17 - intensity so let's go up here make a
15:19 - private fold for our shake intensity and
15:24 - that's what we'll multiply on our
15:26 - direction
15:28 - so just for testing let's go here on our
15:32 - awake and let's set it to a testing
15:33 - value of let's say 5 up so let's see if
15:37 - the hit counter is indeed shaking okay
15:40 - here we are
15:40 - where's the enemy there he is and I hit
15:42 - him and yep there we go it is indeed
15:44 - shaking but obviously way too much so
15:46 - let's set a more accurate value okay so
15:52 - like this it's a bit better it's a bit
15:54 - too intense but this is the effect that
15:56 - we want let's see so we want on the
15:58 - absolute maximum to be with an intensity
16:00 - of 1 ok so that's the value we want
16:03 - however we also want the intensity to
16:06 - drop down over time so here on our
16:08 - update first we're only going to shake
16:11 - it the shake intensity if it is above 0
16:15 - if it is above 0 then let's decrease the
16:18 - intensity by a certain amount so we
16:20 - float for the in
16:21 - three drop amount and here we define how
16:27 - fast we want to drop so let's start off
16:29 - testing with 0.5 F and we reduce our
16:33 - intensity by the intensity drop amount
16:38 - multiplied by time downtime okay that's
16:44 - pretty much it so we have a nice flow
16:46 - that we set to a certain value and on
16:48 - every update it's gonna drop by a
16:50 - certain amount and if it is under zero
16:52 - then we simply stop shaking so my t if
16:55 - he stops the shaking okay here he is and
16:58 - yep there you go the shake stopped and
17:00 - went down and now it's completely
17:01 - stopped okay awesome so that's exactly
17:03 - the effect that we want now obviously we
17:06 - don't want to add the shake intensity in
17:08 - here so we go down here when we hit an
17:10 - enemy and it's in here that we need to
17:13 - set our intensity however we also want
17:15 - it to be per hit so what's the final
17:18 - float for the base intensity then a
17:24 - float for the / head intensity and we
17:30 - set our shake intensity to be the base
17:32 - was the per hit x the hip count okay so
17:38 - whenever we hit an enemy we should be
17:40 - able to see the hit counter shake and
17:42 - more enemies we hit the more it shakes
17:44 - we can play around these values to make
17:47 - it shake more or less depending on the
17:48 - number of hits so let's test okay here
17:51 - we are let's see the first hit and there
17:53 - you go just a very very slight shake and
17:55 - a couple more and yet there you go as
17:57 - you can see it increases its shaking
18:00 - more and more and as goes up the color
18:02 - is still changing and there you go the
18:04 - shake now becomes more intense and after
18:05 - a while we still have the hit counter
18:07 - but no more shake so now go away and we
18:09 - got hit so now let's build it up to the
18:12 - maximum and see shake it's in blue 2024
18:16 - shake some more and set 30 we are near
18:19 - our maximum and here we go hit 40 and
18:24 - getting close to 50 and as you can see
18:25 - that is a very very intense shake so we
18:29 - probably need to do the same thing with
18:30 - it for the text size in order to add
18:32 - women otherwise it's gonna continue
18:34 - shaking to the point where it we can no
18:36 - longer actually see the velum okay so we
18:39 - need to add a maximum but that's exactly
18:40 - what we want when we hit it goes up when
18:43 - we stop hitting it slows down and stops
18:46 - the shake okay
18:48 - awesome so here on the shake intensity
18:50 - we do the same thing we do a clamp and
18:57 - final let's also add an effect that it's
18:59 - not really related to the hit counter
19:00 - but it looks good which is just a simple
19:02 - screen shake so in here when we hit our
19:05 - enemy let's go to the utils glass shake
19:08 - camera let's shake by small amount and
19:12 - when we kill an enemy let's shake a bit
19:15 - more okay so let's see the final effect
19:20 - here we are with our final effect my
19:22 - character moving around when I hit an
19:24 - enemy yup there you go and there's the
19:26 - screen shake and there's the shake of
19:28 - the head counter and the hit company
19:29 - goes up as it goes up it changes the
19:31 - color it starts shaking more and more
19:34 - intensely in order to really show that
19:36 - we're getting more and more hits and
19:38 - keeps going up and the color changes and
19:40 - goes up to 50 but the counter keeps
19:44 - going up everything looks great and if
19:46 - we do get hit yep there you go we got a
19:48 - nice reset and we're back on one so here
19:51 - we go keep throwing keep shaking and
19:53 - looks quite awesome so this is a really
19:55 - great effect and really makes things
19:57 - look a lot more impactful as always you
