00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's learn how to make a
00:03 - character with a weapon aimed perfectly
00:05 - at a target this is essential to make
00:07 - your characters aim correct otherwise
00:09 - they will only be aiming straight
00:10 - forward and not up or down which makes
00:12 - it look quite bad
00:14 - so we want to have our target position
00:16 - in the world anywhere in the world and
00:18 - we want to visually see the character
00:19 - correctly rotate and aim towards that
00:21 - target perfectly this is obviously
00:23 - perfect for a character but the same
00:25 - method also works for something like a
00:27 - tower defense game where you want to aim
00:28 - a cannon or of course just make a
00:30 - character simply and look at a target by
00:32 - rotating the head if you prefer a more
00:34 - guided path with step-by-step lectures
00:36 - then check out my complete courses learn
00:38 - how to make a builder defender game
00:40 - using c sharp just like i make my own
00:42 - steam games or learn how to make games
00:44 - internally using visual scripting or
00:46 - learn all about unity with the ultimate
00:48 - overview course which contains over 13
00:50 - lectures each covering a different tool
00:52 - or feature of the engine to help you
00:54 - make better games faster i'm always
00:56 - available in the courses q a section
00:57 - answering your questions every single
00:59 - day so check out all the courses with
01:01 - the link in the description so a while
01:02 - ago i made a third person shooter video
01:05 - in there i covered everything from start
01:07 - to finish how to handle the character
01:08 - movement find the target position in the
01:10 - world and so on the only thing that i
01:12 - didn't cover in that video was how to
01:14 - make the final animation aim perfectly
01:16 - towards the exact target position now i
01:18 - didn't cover it in that video just
01:20 - because i first needed to cover the
01:22 - animation rigging package which is
01:23 - necessary for making this work and a
01:26 - while ago i made a full video on that
01:27 - package so go watch it if you haven't
01:29 - seen it in there i actually mentioned
01:31 - this specific use case but i figured i'd
01:34 - make a dedicated video just to help the
01:35 - people searching for this exact topic
01:37 - that might not even know about that
01:39 - package so over here let's build it from
01:41 - scratch
01:42 - over here is my starting scene so i just
01:44 - have my character i can move around look
01:46 - anywhere and then when i press the right
01:48 - mouse button the character aims with the
01:50 - weapon straightforward however now i can
01:53 - look up or down but the character's aim
01:56 - does not change it's all fixed so as you
01:58 - can see it's constantly pointing at that
01:59 - height
02:00 - so if i aim to the ground it's
02:02 - definitely not aiming to the ground if i
02:03 - am to the sky definitely not aiming to
02:05 - the sky so this is exactly the point
02:07 - where i'm left on the third person
02:08 - shooter video so go watch that one to
02:11 - see how i got here this one obviously
02:13 - does not look good so let's make it aim
02:15 - correctly towards the actual target like
02:17 - i said this whole thing is based on the
02:18 - animation braking package so you install
02:20 - it through the package manager
02:22 - you can go watch that other video if you
02:24 - want to learn more about it in more
02:25 - detail and see all the possible use
02:27 - cases that this package enables
02:29 - so here let's start using it over here
02:31 - is my character now the first thing we
02:33 - want is to set up a rig so again just
02:36 - going into the animation breaking menu
02:38 - and going to rig setup
02:39 - now let's also add a bone renderer so we
02:42 - can see all the visual bones there they
02:44 - are
02:45 - now let's set up our aim constraint so
02:48 - we go inside let's go inside our rig
02:50 - inside let's make an empty game object
02:52 - call it game
02:54 - then let's go into add component
02:55 - animation rigging and let's choose a
02:58 - multi-aim constraint okay so this one is
03:00 - how we're going to make the weapon aim
03:02 - perfectly at the target now for the
03:04 - weapon how i have it set up here it's
03:06 - actually child of the hand so here's the
03:09 - route the entire skeleton all the bones
03:11 - inside i've got the hand right and
03:13 - inside i've got the rifle so really what
03:15 - we want is to aim with the hand bone and
03:16 - then the rifle will follow so over here
03:19 - on the aim constraint for the constraint
03:21 - object let's drag the hand reference
03:23 - then let's make sure the aim and the up
03:25 - axis are correctly set up so let's
03:27 - select the hand game object and here
03:29 - make sure you know about this button to
03:31 - go between local and global space in
03:33 - this case to make sure the x's are
03:35 - correct we need to check them in local
03:37 - space so in local we can see the fourth
03:39 - vector is over here the red one and the
03:40 - red one is the x
03:42 - so on the aim for the aim axis let's put
03:44 - it on the x and then for the f vector
03:46 - we've got the blue one that's the z but
03:48 - that one is pointing down we want up so
03:50 - let's put it on minus z so here for the
03:52 - up axis it's a minus z
03:54 - okay so then we just need to assign the
03:56 - target so the source object and for the
03:59 - target we're going to use the mouse
04:00 - position but let's just first make a
04:02 - simple target just for testing
04:04 - all right so here i've got just a simple
04:06 - sphere
04:07 - let's make this the target so over here
04:08 - on the source object just attach this
04:10 - one okay so that's it no need to play
04:12 - around with any more settings so let's
04:14 - test just like this and yep just with
04:16 - this you can see it's already working so
04:18 - i've got the target i can place it
04:20 - anywhere and as you can see over there
04:21 - the hand is aiming perfectly at the
04:23 - target
04:24 - so i can go left right up down and it
04:26 - always aims perfectly all right so far
04:28 - so good you can even verify that it's
04:31 - actually working so over here as a child
04:33 - of the hand let's just add a simple cube
04:38 - and you can just stretch it out and here
04:40 - no matter where i place it if you can
04:42 - see it is aiming perfectly all right so
04:45 - far so good
04:46 - so this is already working but just like
04:48 - this it looks a bit odd so pretty much
04:51 - the only thing that is turning is just
04:52 - the hand the rest of the body everything
04:54 - else is still static
04:56 - so in reality you don't really aim just
04:58 - with your hand you move the entire body
05:00 - so let's solve that let's make another
05:02 - constraint so over here let's create
05:04 - another empty game object
05:06 - call it the body aim
05:08 - then let's add a component animation
05:09 - rigging once again a multi-game
05:11 - constraint then for the constraint
05:13 - object let's apply it to the spine so
05:15 - this bone so over here just drag the
05:17 - spine bone all right
05:19 - then once again we need to set up the
05:20 - axes so let's select the spine and let's
05:22 - see the forward axis
05:24 - okay so make sure you're in local and
05:26 - over here so the forward one is the
05:28 - green so that's the y but it's reverse
05:30 - so the
05:31 - aim won't be minus y so over here for
05:34 - the aim minus y then for the up vector
05:36 - we've got the red so that's the x but
05:38 - it's pointing down so minus x and then
05:41 - for the source object let's use the
05:42 - exact same one okay so let's test and
05:45 - now as i move the target yep it does
05:47 - work so the hips are rotating left and
05:49 - right in order to look at the object
05:51 - alright that's great and now this is
05:53 - also the perfect time to look at a
05:55 - specific thing for how this system works
05:57 - you can see the hips are indeed working
05:59 - perfectly but over there the hand is no
06:02 - longer aiming perfectly so the hand is
06:04 - clearly not aiming towards the target
06:05 - like that nope now what is happening
06:08 - here is that the hands are indeed
06:10 - rotating to face the target perfectly
06:12 - just like before the issue is that after
06:14 - the hand is rotated then we're rotating
06:16 - the body so in the end after the body
06:18 - rotates the hand is no longer facing
06:20 - perfectly the issue here is that we're
06:22 - rotating the hand first and then the
06:24 - body second which in turn rotates the
06:26 - hand so really what we want is to do the
06:28 - reverse we want to first rotate the body
06:31 - and then rotate the hand by the way if
06:33 - you find the video helpful please hit
06:34 - the like button it's a tiny thing but it
06:36 - really does help thanks now that is
06:38 - super simple solved the way that this
06:40 - system works is based on the order in
06:42 - the hierarchy so if we just take the
06:44 - body aim and drag it above the aim on
06:46 - the hierarchy and now if we test and yep
06:49 - now it is indeed working correctly so
06:51 - the body rotates and the hand is still
06:53 - aiming perfectly no matter where i place
06:55 - it all right great
06:57 - so everything is working but here just
06:59 - one tiny thing is this is kind of
07:02 - personal preference but maybe the body
07:03 - is rotating way too much
07:05 - so the body is rotating perfectly just
07:07 - like the hand in order to make it a bit
07:09 - more natural you can actually lower the
07:11 - weight of the body so you can go over
07:13 - here onto the body aim constraint and
07:15 - over here you see a weight slider so if
07:18 - you want you can lower this to something
07:19 - like 0.7 and now essentially the body
07:22 - still rotates but it doesn't rotate
07:23 - exactly as much so this makes it look a
07:25 - bit more natural okay so everything is
07:27 - looking good now there's just one final
07:29 - thing that we need
07:30 - right now the chest and the hand are
07:32 - rotating that's great but in this case
07:34 - when working with the rifle the
07:36 - character is also supposed to hold the
07:37 - front of the rifle with the other hand
07:40 - right now the other hand is just staying
07:41 - up there not actually placed anywhere so
07:43 - once again we can make another
07:45 - constraint to solve this let's make
07:47 - another game object call this one the
07:49 - second hand grab weapon
07:52 - and let's go into add component
07:54 - animation rigging and now the constraint
07:56 - that we want for this one this one is
07:57 - going to be a two bone ik constraint if
08:00 - you don't know about this constraint
08:01 - again you can go watch the dedicated
08:03 - animation breaking video essentially
08:05 - this is the kind of thing that you use
08:06 - for arm placement or leg placement so it
08:08 - takes two bones like the upper arm and
08:10 - the lower arm and then takes a target
08:12 - for the tip so that's the hand and
08:14 - places the hand and rotates the arm in
08:16 - the upper arm to where it makes sense so
08:17 - we're here with this
08:19 - all we need to do is assign the tip
08:21 - so in this case we want for the left
08:23 - hand
08:24 - so let's go make sure we find the left
08:26 - hand there it is so for the second hand
08:29 - let's go and drag the hand reference so
08:30 - that's the tip and once again we can use
08:33 - the super awesome auto setup from deep
08:35 - transform and there you go it
08:36 - automatically selects the elbow in the
08:38 - shoulder okay
08:39 - and then for the source object when you
08:41 - use that menu to auto set from the tip
08:43 - it automatically creates these two
08:44 - objects however these objects we want
08:46 - their position to be relative to the
08:48 - hand so instead of being a child of this
08:51 - object let's go and make them a child of
08:53 - the right hand okay so let's test just
08:55 - like this
08:56 - and yep just like this it is indeed
08:58 - working so the target is currently
09:00 - placed on the hand positions and as you
09:02 - can see the upper arm and the lower arm
09:04 - are correctly bending in order to reach
09:06 - that target so we need to do is just
09:08 - take this game object and place it
09:09 - correctly so over here let's grab the
09:12 - second hand grab weapon target and we're
09:14 - going to want to grab
09:16 - over there up on the front and let's
09:18 - just position this correctly
09:29 - okay so like this that's a pretty good
09:31 - position and here's a quick empty tip so
09:34 - we move this object but we're in play
09:36 - mode so when we only play mode we're
09:37 - going to lose this position since then
09:39 - let's go into transform and go up here
09:41 - and copy the component now we stop
09:43 - playing
09:44 - and now the transform is back on the
09:46 - incorrect place so now right click and
09:48 - paste component values alright so now if
09:50 - we hit on play
09:51 - and yep over there we do see that the
09:53 - second hand is placed correctly so now
09:55 - just a hint right now it looks like the
09:57 - character has a broken arm so the elbow
09:59 - is meant to rotate to the other side so
10:01 - let's put it just over here and once
10:04 - again let's copy the component and paste
10:06 - component values and yep there it is now
10:08 - we've got our aim perfect and we can
10:10 - take it to target object place it
10:12 - anywhere and always aims perfectly and
10:14 - aims correctly so there you go just like
10:16 - that i can put it anywhere
10:18 - and everything looks much better much
10:20 - more natural okay great so the last
10:22 - thing that we need is just to connect
10:24 - this to the rest of the logic and set
10:26 - the target
10:27 - for the target that's actually very
10:28 - simple
10:29 - over here i already have some code in
10:32 - order to get the correct mouse position
10:34 - i actually cover this in detail in
10:35 - another video
10:36 - so i've got an object being moved and
10:38 - placed onto where i'm aiming the mouse
10:40 - really all i need is to use this object
10:42 - as the target so let's go into all of
10:44 - our constraints and just swap it out so
10:46 - use this one
10:47 - and use this one and on this one also
10:49 - drag the reference
10:51 - so here it is and yep it's already
10:52 - working perfectly so i can rotate i can
10:55 - look anywhere and it looks much more
10:57 - natural than the first version all right
10:59 - so far so good
11:00 - so the last thing that we need is just
11:02 - the aim in order to start and stop
11:04 - aiming right now if i stop aiming the
11:06 - character is still aiming so look at
11:08 - that this is not intentional so let's
11:10 - fix that over here is the script that i
11:12 - made in the third person shooter video
11:14 - so we're going to want to play around
11:16 - with the rig weight dynamically so the
11:18 - first thing that we need is an actual
11:20 - field to get the rig reference
11:22 - however if we just use serialized film
11:25 - of rig then nope this type is not
11:28 - identified
11:30 - so we need to add the namespace in this
11:32 - case it's inside
11:33 - unityengine.animations.rigging
11:37 - okay so now we've got our aim rig
11:38 - reference let's rename this the aim rig
11:41 - and then over here are my events for
11:43 - when the aim started and when the aim
11:44 - stopped
11:46 - so over here i could just add set the
11:48 - aim rig set the weight into one and then
11:51 - back to zero so that would make it
11:53 - instant or we can make it nice and
11:55 - smooth and use some simple interpolation
11:58 - so here let's just add a simple private
12:00 - float let's call it the aim rig weight
12:04 - and then with this let's go down into
12:07 - the events so when we start let's set
12:09 - the game rate weight to one when we stop
12:11 - let's set it back into zero and then on
12:14 - update we really just set it
12:20 - all right so that's pretty much it just
12:21 - using a simple
12:23 - in order to constantly alert the weight
12:25 - onto the target weight okay so let's see
12:27 - if it's working so starting off on idle
12:29 - so the ik isn't running so i can look
12:31 - around my character and yep everything
12:33 - works correct i can walk and so on all
12:35 - right so far so good and now as i press
12:37 - the right mouse button if there we go we
12:39 - go into a mode and the system kicks in
12:42 - and the animation rig is currently
12:44 - active so i can now point my weapon
12:46 - anywhere and as you can see it always
12:48 - aims perfectly so i can point to the
12:49 - ground and yep the character aims
12:51 - correctly at the ground i can point the
12:52 - sky and it aims at the sky
12:54 - so i can walk around i can aim i can
12:56 - shoot and yep everything is aiming
12:59 - perfectly alright awesome and again with
13:02 - all this remember the the animation
13:03 - itself is just a simple static animation
13:05 - just pointing straight ahead so it's the
13:08 - animation rating system that is
13:09 - overriding that basic animation in order
13:11 - to make all of these bones aim perfectly
13:13 - at the target
13:14 - and with this you already have a really
13:16 - nice controller for a third person
13:17 - shooter great alright hope that's useful
13:20 - check out these videos to learn some
13:22 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
13:24 - supporters for making these videos
