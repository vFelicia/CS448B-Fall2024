00:00 - in this video we're going to review all
00:01 - the videos published in April 2019
00:04 - Captain America damage pop-ups level
00:06 - system and more let's begin
00:11 - [Music]
00:15 - so April had a lot of awesome videos and
00:18 - interesting systems starting with one of
00:20 - the coolest elements which was making
00:22 - some damage pop-ups so we have a player
00:24 - character shooting out some zombies when
00:26 - they get hit
00:27 - we have damage being calculated and
00:29 - shown as a nice pop up the puppet moves
00:31 - up and away and vanishes after some time
00:34 - it is a nicely polished effect with
00:36 - changing scale movement alpha and
00:38 - special changes for critical hits the
00:41 - effect code is nicely set up to make it
00:43 - easy to plug into any game and easily
00:45 - use then one of the last videos of the
00:48 - month which was making Captain America
00:50 - and his shield this is a really cool
00:52 - character video where we have Captain
00:54 - America moving and roaming around and
00:56 - obviously throwing his shield the shield
00:58 - has logic and physics allowing it to
01:01 - bounce off walls and target multiple
01:02 - enemies then the captain can also press
01:06 - the same button to both throw and recall
01:08 - the shield it is a great video to
01:10 - understand the logic behind making a
01:12 - brand new mechanic and how to correctly
01:14 - added to pre-existing code another great
01:17 - and in that video was the one covering a
01:19 - level system this is the most
01:21 - comprehensive video I've done on a
01:23 - single topic so if you're making any
01:25 - sort of game that needs some levels give
01:27 - it a watch it covers the creation of a
01:29 - complete level system with different
01:31 - amounts of experience for a level event
01:33 - some level up and easy tests for
01:35 - equipment level gating it also covers
01:37 - how to separate logic from visuals in
01:39 - order to have a nice animated moving
01:41 - experience bar the funnel system has
01:44 - buttons to test adding experience in
01:46 - seeing the player level up so we can
01:47 - equip better helmets then a video
01:50 - covering the release of unity 20 19.1
01:53 - and the features that come with it the
01:55 - pace at which unity keeps adding and
01:57 - improving features is quite great and
01:59 - it's always nice to see new features
02:01 - coming out of preview unlike for example
02:02 - on the shader graph updates like these
02:05 - definitely make me happy to keep working
02:07 - on unity for a long time to come related
02:10 - to that there was a video explaining
02:11 - unity dots what it is how it works and
02:14 - what are the benefits dots is composed
02:17 - of the entity component system job
02:19 - system and burst compound
02:21 - it will be the main way to work in unity
02:23 - in the future so it's very important to
02:25 - fully understand it I'm currently doing
02:27 - research so I can do some simple ECS
02:29 - tutorials so stay tuned next month then
02:32 - a nice beginner tutorial covering how to
02:34 - do a simple jump this is great if you're
02:37 - just getting started or if you've never
02:39 - done a platformer before it involves
02:41 - working with unity physics in order to
02:43 - do the jump and also test for the ground
02:46 - then we covered making a scene manager
02:48 - this is a great simple clean class that
02:51 - helps you with level loading it's very
02:53 - simple to use and has a proper loading
02:55 - screen instead of having a static image
02:58 - there was a video on one of the classes
03:00 - from the utilities the function timer
03:02 - essentially shows you how to trigger an
03:04 - action after some time this is
03:06 - incredibly useful for quickly testing
03:08 - things the whole video goes through the
03:10 - creation of the class and in the end we
03:11 - end up with something extremely similar
03:13 - to the actual class from the utilities
03:16 - also video showing how to use custom
03:19 - font with text mesh pro so if you have a
03:21 - game with unique characters and would
03:23 - like to use a special font with some
03:25 - nice effects this is how you do it
03:27 - you create a font acid then extract the
03:29 - Atlas so you can modify it in any image
03:32 - program then you can use it for writing
03:34 - texts just like any normal font so this
03:37 - is great for special names or something
03:39 - like special numbers there were four
03:42 - quick tips videos first how to use game
03:45 - object icons this is very useful
03:47 - especially if you use lots of empty game
03:49 - objects for designing your own levels
03:50 - you can view icons in the editor and
03:52 - also in game when you enable gizmos then
03:56 - the ability to add two inspectors at
03:58 - once this is quite useful when you want
04:00 - to see the inner workings of multiple
04:02 - objects at once
04:03 - you can also set one inspector to normal
04:05 - and want to debug view in order to view
04:08 - both States at the same time now the
04:10 - quick tip on how to copy/paste component
04:13 - values so you can test out your game and
04:15 - while in the middle of the game you can
04:17 - modify all the values until you find the
04:19 - right ones then instead of having to
04:21 - memorize them or take a screenshot you
04:23 - can just copy and paste the component
04:25 - values and finally a tip regarding the
04:28 - issues with the Viney to intz
04:31 - this is one of those simple but
04:32 - essential things to know about data
04:33 - times if you divide 3 by 10 you don't
04:36 - get 0.3 as you would expect or rather
04:38 - just zero you need to be aware of the
04:41 - data types you're using and the
04:42 - limitations they have and lastly there
04:45 - was a similar video just letting you
04:46 - know that if you enjoyed these videos
04:48 - you can support the channel and also
04:50 - play great games by getting the game
04:52 - bundle from the website turnaround
04:54 - takuan is also available on Steam and if
04:56 - you first grab the game mode from the
04:58 - website you can get an extra discount on
05:00 - it the games are only unique and offers
05:02 - something different so check out that
05:04 - video to see what interesting systems
05:06 - each of them contains I've also covered
05:09 - a bunch of those systems on the channel
05:10 - so you can play the game to see the
05:12 - final effect in action and then watch
05:13 - the videos to see how they work so that
05:16 - was it for the month of April 2019 I
05:19 - hope you found the videos helpful and
05:20 - learned something along the way
05:21 - post any questions you have in the
05:23 - comments and I'll do my best answer them
05:25 - alright see you next time
