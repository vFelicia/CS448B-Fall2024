00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the asosaurus full of awesome tones and
00:04 - assets help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - August 22. this one is the list of paid
00:11 - systems and tools in the last video I
00:13 - already covered all the best free new
00:14 - assets so go watch that if you haven't
00:16 - seen it and next video I will be
00:18 - covering the Tapas and effects let me
00:20 - know in the comments if you pick up any
00:21 - of these and what you intend to do with
00:22 - them as always there's links to the US
00:24 - in the description and as bonus you can
00:25 - use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10
00:27 - off your order also right now Unity is
00:29 - having a sale with tons of the best
00:31 - assets discounted and if you're a fan of
00:33 - realistic fantasy then check out the
00:35 - latest Humble Bundle features quite a
00:37 - lot of assets from Infinity PBR it's got
00:39 - some gorgeous dragons creatures and
00:41 - dungeons there's lots of realistic
00:43 - weapons and armor all in a high poly
00:45 - realistic Style with tons of variations
00:47 - the bundle also includes some courses by
00:49 - Jason Wyman as usual it's a super deep
00:52 - discount over 90 off so if you like this
00:54 - style go ahead and pick it up with the
00:55 - link in the description alright so
00:57 - starting off with some fun soft body
00:59 - physics this this is how you can have
01:01 - some soft squishy objects interacting
01:03 - with physics it works on any mesh so you
01:05 - can make some really nice squishy jelly
01:07 - or you can even apply it to a player
01:09 - character so this would be great for a
01:11 - kind of boxing game to add some nice
01:12 - deformation when taking a punch and you
01:15 - could also use the included soft body
01:16 - controller to make a game where the
01:18 - player plays as some kind of slime so
01:20 - this one is really interesting really
01:21 - nice effect and yes it is pretty cheap
01:23 - next up if you're unlike me and math is
01:25 - not your strong point then this acid
01:27 - looks perfect rather than trying to come
01:28 - up with math to calculate projectile
01:30 - trajectories you basically just give it
01:32 - a force and in launch position to see
01:34 - where it lands or you can give it a
01:36 - Target and currently the velocity needed
01:38 - to get there within a certain amount of
01:39 - time so if your game uses rigid body
01:41 - physics for the projectiles then this
01:43 - can be quite useful up next another
01:45 - really interesting one here is yolua I
01:48 - must say that Lua is one of those things
01:49 - that I've heard tons of great things
01:50 - about but never actually use it myself
01:52 - if you don't know Lua is a scripting
01:55 - language it's widely used in modifying
01:57 - games lots of games enable custom
01:59 - modding logic and you write that custom
02:01 - logic in Lua so this hasn't as a
02:03 - framework to help you write little code
02:05 - that easily interacts with unity game
02:06 - objects so if you're curious to
02:08 - experiment with adding modding to your
02:10 - game definitely go ahead and research
02:11 - lower then if your game has some
02:13 - procedural placement of some objects
02:15 - look at this you'll if you try placing
02:18 - objects similarly randomly it can
02:19 - produce quite strange results with some
02:21 - objects too close together
02:23 - so this tool lets you place them all in
02:25 - a much more natural way it works in both
02:27 - 2D and 3D and also has a snap to terrain
02:29 - feature so you just select your prefabs
02:31 - click a button and that's it next up if
02:33 - you have some complex meshes and you
02:35 - need some extremely accurate colliders
02:37 - look at this one if you've ever tried
02:39 - using the Bounty mesh colliders you will
02:42 - see that the shape is primarily focused
02:43 - on a lower number of polygons and not
02:45 - necessarily on accuracy so you end up
02:47 - with tons of edges that have no visual
02:49 - but they do have a collider this tool
02:51 - gives you a lot more control over
02:53 - exactly where the con leather shape is
02:54 - so you can make it perfectly match the
02:56 - visuals it's super easy to use they
02:58 - include editor and lets you paint on
03:00 - your objects to Define all of the con
03:01 - leather Parts this one is version 2 so
03:04 - it's an extremely well built well
03:05 - Polished in battle tested tool then if
03:07 - you want a quick way to handle lots of
03:09 - weapons look at this one it's a weapon
03:11 - projectile system it works in both 2D
03:14 - and 3D you can easily spawn tons of
03:16 - projectiles or do some raycast shooting
03:18 - it helps you handle collisions firing
03:20 - and secondary modes you can change
03:22 - firing speed clip sizes reload and tons
03:25 - more also supports burst fire with
03:27 - multi-shot and the whole thing works
03:29 - with object pulling so it's also
03:30 - extremely performed definitely an
03:32 - interesting asset if you want to quickly
03:33 - jump start your projectile creation then
03:36 - here's a fun one a runtime level term so
03:39 - it's a fully for legend level editor
03:41 - that runs while the game is playing it
03:43 - works on a voxel Channel system so you
03:45 - can Define whatever voxels you want and
03:47 - place them anywhere you can modify the
03:49 - Skybox modify colors fog and so on again
03:52 - all of it while running in runtime
03:54 - it even lets you bake occlusion calling
03:56 - so the level ends up being super
03:58 - performant and also supports nav mesh
04:00 - baking the levels are stored in a Json
04:02 - format making it super easy to upload to
04:05 - a server and share files between your
04:06 - players next if you want to make a card
04:09 - game and you need a controller here's a
04:11 - fun one it's very easy to use you can
04:13 - get it up and running in a few minutes
04:14 - if you've never tried making a card game
04:16 - then believe me this is extremely useful
04:18 - building all the driving physics for
04:20 - yourself is a ton of work there's tons
04:23 - of fields and curves you can play around
04:24 - with to get the exact physics Behavior
04:26 - you want for the car and there's also a
04:28 - demo you can try out for free then
04:31 - here's a really awesome one that I'm
04:32 - thinking of getting myself it's called
04:34 - asset inventory if you're like me and
04:36 - you buy tons of assets it can be tricky
04:38 - to know what you have in all of those
04:40 - packs so this one is a really awesome
04:42 - way to search through all of those packs
04:44 - to find exactly what you're looking for
04:45 - it features super fast searching lots of
04:48 - previews so you can see exactly what
04:49 - you're looking for and the main thing is
04:51 - you don't have to import them into your
04:53 - project so you don't end up with tons of
04:55 - clutter in your project just to try to
04:56 - find a specific asset you can even add
04:59 - custom sources so that's also super
05:01 - useful for me since I own lots of facts
05:03 - from Humble bundles at the centy store
05:04 - so it's really awesome and it's pretty
05:06 - cheap so I'll definitely pick this up
05:07 - for myself up next if your game has skin
05:10 - mesh renderers and you want some
05:11 - extremely accurate breakouts look at
05:13 - this one usually you use a simplified
05:15 - capsule highlighter when trying to
05:17 - handle collisions with characters that
05:19 - works for most cases but if your game
05:21 - requires some extreme Precision then a
05:22 - simple and capsicle Ladder will not work
05:24 - so that's where this asset comes in
05:26 - this one is a compute Shader so it's
05:28 - extremely efficient this would be
05:30 - perfect for some super accurate bullets
05:32 - or maybe some punches or just find the
05:34 - exact edge of the character to place
05:36 - some armor or some object alright so
05:38 - those are my top 10 new tones and
05:40 - systems on the MTS store for August 22.
05:42 - there's links to all the description and
05:44 - this bonus you can use the coupon code
05:45 - monkey 10 to get 10 off your order and
05:48 - if you're a fan of realistic fantasy
05:49 - then check out the latest Humble Bundle
05:51 - also check out my own free Internet on
05:53 - store alright hope that's useful check
05:55 - out these videos to learn some more
