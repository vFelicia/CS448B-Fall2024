00:00 - in this video we're going to make a
00:01 - sprite outline shader using shadow graph
00:03 - we're going to have an outline apply to
00:05 - any sprite and be able to customize the
00:07 - thickness and color what's beginning
00:12 - [Music]
00:16 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:19 - and this channel is all about helping
00:20 - you learn how to make your own games
00:22 - with nf2 torrents made by a professional
00:24 - indie game developer so if you find the
00:26 - video helpful consider subscribing okay
00:28 - so this is what we're trying to make
00:29 - over here is my character and as you can
00:31 - see there's a nice outline around all of
00:33 - the body parts I can increase or
00:36 - decrease the thickness of the outline I
00:38 - can also modify the car and using plume
00:41 - and and HDR color I can make it have a
00:43 - very nice glow so just like that the
00:46 - whole effect is made in a pre simple
00:48 - shader and at the end we're going to
00:49 - take the base effect and expand upon it
00:51 - and we're going to make a nice outline
00:53 - and animate it through our shader
00:55 - alright so this circle let's get to it
00:57 - okay so here I am in my starting scene
01:00 - let's begin by making our shader so in
01:03 - the project files right click a new
01:05 - shader to the renderer with a sprite on
01:08 - the graph let's call this our outline
01:10 - and open it up okay here we are inside
01:14 - of shader graph without a very nice
01:16 - master node now the first thing we need
01:18 - is a texture so up here create a new
01:21 - texture 2d call this the main text and
01:24 - set the reference to underscore main
01:26 - text this name has to be exact this is
01:29 - the default name for the main texture
01:30 - which the sprite renderer uses to apply
01:32 - to the sprite so here on let's unlike
01:34 - the default and drag it onto the board
01:36 - now in here we cannot use the texture
01:38 - directly so first we're going to add a
01:41 - sample texture node here's our texture
01:43 - and then we can say well pass the rgba
01:45 - onto there and there it is and just make
01:47 - this a quad and there you go there's our
01:49 - nice preview ok so let's go up here to
01:51 - save our asset and now here let's test
01:54 - it out so over here I have a material so
01:57 - let's just go up here and change the
01:59 - shader into your shader graphs and our
02:00 - outline shader and there it is a field
02:02 - for our main text
02:03 - let's test and if there's our character
02:05 - currently visible just sending around
02:07 - okay so far so good now back in the
02:09 - shader graph what we're trying to do
02:11 - here is build an outline so that means
02:13 - we want to essentially expand the
02:15 - spreadsheet body parts now your first
02:17 - approach might be to simply scale the
02:19 - texture so we could do that by creating
02:21 - a tiling and offset node the tiling is
02:24 - how many times the texture repeats so
02:26 - for example with the town of two on the
02:28 - X it would
02:29 - the texture twice horizontally let's
02:31 - apply to our UV so there it is you can
02:34 - see the texture repeats twice so we
02:36 - could use this to scale our texture by
02:37 - putting a tiling under one
02:39 - so in this instead of putting two or one
02:41 - let's foot 2.9 and just like this you
02:44 - can see that the texture is indeed
02:45 - bigger so put this one at point 8 this
02:47 - one at point 8 and there you go as you
02:48 - can see the texture is indeed scaling
02:50 - however the texture is scaling from the
02:52 - lower left corner what we want and said
02:54 - is for each body part to scale up from
02:56 - its center and not from a corner of the
02:59 - entire texture so this approach is not
03:01 - good for what we're trying to make
03:02 - instead how we're going to achieve our
03:04 - up line is by shifting it texture left
03:06 - right up and down so instead of
03:08 - modifying the telling field we're going
03:10 - to play around with the offset field so
03:12 - set these to 1 okay and here when I
03:15 - modify the offset you can see what I'm
03:17 - into the texture it gets shifted to one
03:19 - side however we also do not want to
03:21 - modify our original texture so let's
03:23 - leave this one as normal get rid of this
03:25 - connection there it is and down here
03:27 - let's make another texture sampling
03:28 - using the exact same texture ok so up
03:32 - here we have our original and now in
03:34 - here let's have one shifted slightly to
03:36 - the side so here if we make the offset a
03:38 - bit big you can see the exact difference
03:40 - between this one and this one so we want
03:42 - the second one to be the up line and
03:44 - then to be added on top of the original
03:46 - ok so let's grab the alpha from this one
03:48 - and place a subtract node and we're
03:51 - going to subtract this alpha from this
03:54 - alpha and just like that you can see our
03:56 - up line so now with this let's define a
03:58 - property for our outline cone so let's
04:01 - go up here make a new color call this
04:03 - the outline color and let's set it to a
04:08 - gr so we can have a nice glow and let's
04:10 - put it on green ok so now we can take
04:12 - our caller drag it in here make a
04:14 - multiply node and we're going to
04:16 - multiply our color by this alpha and
04:18 - there it is there's our outline and I
04:21 - finally only need this to apply it this
04:22 - one on top of our texture so push the
04:25 - master here and we do a add node and we
04:28 - add this one on top of that one and put
04:30 - the output in there and just like that
04:32 - on the preview you can see our nice
04:34 - outline on the left side let's test this
04:36 - and if there's our character with an
04:39 - outline on the on left side all right so
04:41 - now all we need to do is apply
04:42 - this exact same thing to all the other
04:44 - sides so let's do that
04:46 - now over here we are shifting positively
04:48 - on the X to get an outline on the on
04:51 - that time however here we are also
04:53 - setting the thickness directly on to
04:55 - this value so let's make it a property
04:57 - instead of a hard-coded value so up here
04:59 - making you vector one call this the
05:01 - outline thickness so we have this nice
05:05 - vector one so we can drag it in here
05:07 - however in here it expects a offset a
05:10 - vector two so it simply do a combine
05:12 - node and we set this onto the r and we
05:16 - output the RG so in here it looks a bit
05:18 - confusing because it's using the in
05:20 - labels for colors but this works the
05:22 - same for a simple vector two or vector
05:24 - four so in here the R represents the X
05:26 - and the G represents a one so we are
05:28 - setting the outline thickness on the X
05:30 - and outputting this one in there and the
05:31 - output is the same as previously so if I
05:34 - increase the thickness there you go you
05:36 - can see how it shifts more so this is
05:38 - working however it's working with very
05:40 - tiny values so point zero one so we can
05:42 - add a nice quality of life improvement
05:44 - in here let's make a static vector one
05:47 - and put it at point zero one and now
05:50 - before we do our math let's first
05:52 - multiply this so you multiply our
05:56 - thickness by this small value and then
05:57 - we get this output now we can appear
05:59 - into our property and set it from
06:01 - default into a slider and we're going to
06:03 - make a slider that goes might say from
06:04 - zero to three so just like that we have
06:07 - 110 set it to 2 can set it to 3 and so
06:10 - on this is not an essential step it just
06:12 - makes a shader easier to use so we can
06:14 - save the asset and see what this looks
06:16 - like so here's the game running and we
06:18 - have our shader properties and here on
06:21 - the thickness you can see our nice
06:22 - slider so we can move it up and down and
06:24 - there you go you can see the sprite
06:26 - moving to the side just like that ok so
06:29 - let's go back to making the other sides
06:31 - so in here we have our texture being
06:34 - shifted to the left side now let's shift
06:36 - it down so we need to essentially
06:38 - duplicate all this except now instead of
06:42 - combining on the R which is the X we're
06:44 - going to put on the G which is the one
06:45 - and just like that you can see that this
06:47 - one is being shifted to the left and
06:48 - this one is being shifted down and this
06:50 - is the original so there it is so
06:52 - afterwards and let's play around with
06:54 - the Alpha for both of these so these
06:56 - we make a nice add node and we had this
06:58 - alpha onto this alpha and you can see in
07:01 - there both the alphas one to the left
07:02 - and one down so now we use this one on
07:04 - the subtract except in here you can
07:06 - already see an issue and the issue is
07:08 - that we are adding values past one so we
07:10 - need to make sure that we clamp them so
07:12 - let's shift all this to the side make a
07:13 - clamp node we're going to clamp this
07:16 - output between 0 and 1 and then we use
07:18 - this one in there and there you go now
07:20 - we have our nice outline going to the
07:22 - left and down and over here on the
07:24 - preview you can already see our result
07:25 - ok let's test this and if there it is we
07:28 - have our character with an outline to
07:29 - the left and going down and again we can
07:31 - play around over here with the slider
07:33 - and you can see the outline increasing
07:35 - and decreasing and the collar the same
07:37 - thing we can also modify it if we want
07:39 - there you go a nice blue alright so far
07:41 - so good now let's set the other sides ok
07:44 - here I am so essentially we're going to
07:45 - duplicate all of this so you first shift
07:47 - it then we sample it and then we add
07:49 - both of them and now here for the offset
07:51 - we essentially want the opposite from
07:53 - this one so we can add a nice negate
07:55 - node so I'm going to grab this one which
07:57 - was the X negated and then push it in
08:00 - here and there you go so this one is
08:02 - shifted to the left and this one to the
08:03 - right and add another node in here and
08:05 - negate the Y and pass it in there and
08:09 - there you go so now this one is going
08:11 - down this one is going out so over here
08:12 - we have the unless noun over here the
08:14 - right and now so now we simply make
08:16 - another add and add this one onto this
08:19 - one so over here you can see we have our
08:23 - four sides then we pass this on to the
08:25 - clamp and there you go and everything
08:27 - else is the same and yep just like that
08:29 - you can see our very nice up line it's
08:31 - going a left-right up-down and there you
08:33 - go with what's very nice let's see it
08:35 - running and if there's our nice outline
08:37 - effect and over here in the inspector we
08:39 - can simply modify the thickness they're
08:42 - given looks very nice and we can also
08:44 - easily modify the color so just like
08:46 - this we have our nice complete outline
08:48 - no here in sheet graph you can see that
08:50 - we did it by shifting the left right up
08:53 - and down so for more scenarios this
08:55 - works perfect but in here if we play
08:58 - around with a massive thickness so as we
08:59 - increase and there you go and we'll get
09:01 - the sword in there so when it's way too
09:03 - big you can see the effect kind of break
09:05 - down so if you need to have very big
09:07 - outlines then one thing you
09:09 - do would be to add four more outlines
09:11 - for each of the diagonal positions so
09:13 - one up right up left down left and down
09:15 - right doing that will help this effect
09:17 - look great even on very large outlines
09:19 - but for most cases again this works
09:21 - perfect here it is with the character
09:23 - having a very nice outline and it's all
09:25 - nicely animated and with a nice flow
09:28 - effect and a gr color we have this very
09:31 - nice outline now finally just for fun we
09:33 - can still add some more stuff onto this
09:34 - effect
10:07 - okay so here I added a new section you
10:10 - can see the final effect with two colors
10:12 - constantly moving and it works is
10:15 - basically by using this noise and the
10:17 - noise is being shifted on the Italian
10:19 - offset and it's being shifted based on a
10:21 - time node so there is a time multiplied
10:23 - by a certain factor then we apply it
10:25 - onto the G which applies on TDY on the
10:27 - offset and makes the grating noise move
10:29 - up so then we take one of those and
10:31 - multiply it by the normal outline color
10:33 - and then we take another one we invert
10:35 - that and we multiply by a secondary
10:37 - color then we add both of them so here
10:39 - we have green and blue and then finally
10:41 - we take all of this we multiply by our
10:43 - original outline and we apply to our
10:46 - sprite so I see the effect if there's
10:49 - our nice outline effect with two colors
10:50 - and constantly moving up so we have a
10:52 - very nice gradient effect so you can see
10:54 - how you can take the baseline of a
10:56 - simple outline and apply it onto various
10:58 - effects as always you can download the
11:00 - project files I need some of these from
