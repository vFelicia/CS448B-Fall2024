00:56 - idea just text based which lets me do it
00:58 - much more regularly than these big
01:00 - videos so check out both links in the
01:01 - description all right so starting off
01:03 - with some gorgeous looking visual
01:04 - effects these are perfect indicators for
01:07 - things like move here or attack here so
01:09 - great for some kind of RTS or action RPG
01:11 - or maybe you can use them as visual
01:13 - Buffs like healing and defense this one
01:15 - is actually a bundle it includes three
01:16 - packs with 40 effects then if you want a
01:19 - gorgeous environment look at this one
01:20 - right away this reminds me of the game
01:22 - or and the blind Forest that was a
01:24 - gorgeous looking game and this
01:25 - environment would be perfect for exactly
01:27 - that but at the same time this is a full
01:28 - 3d scene so you could use it for a side
01:31 - platformer like that game or just a
01:32 - normal 3D game next here's a fun one all
01:35 - about Kawai animations definitely a very
01:37 - unique animation pack very Niche this
01:39 - would be perfect for some kind of anime
01:41 - game it includes all kinds of animations
01:43 - in a kawaii style but then also for some
01:45 - reason also has some attack animations
01:47 - so definitely strange pack in total
01:49 - there's over 200 animations so it's
01:50 - actually pretty big next if you need
01:52 - some tune V effects look at this one all
01:54 - of these effects look really gorgeous
01:56 - they all look really satisfying there's
01:58 - tons of variation that you could use in
01:59 - many ways I could see this being used in
02:01 - a diblik game or maybe even something
02:03 - like Devil MC rry then if you need low
02:05 - poly weapons here's a nice huge pack
02:07 - it's got quite an impressive amount and
02:09 - it's actually quite cheap you've got
02:11 - everything you could possibly want so
02:12 - you've got rifles you've got shotguns
02:14 - pistols SMGs there's some heavy machine
02:16 - guns snipers launchers even grenades and
02:19 - flashbangs so if you don't have any pack
02:21 - with tons and tons of weapons then this
02:22 - would be a great one or maybe you're
02:24 - making a game inspired by Horizon zero
02:26 - Dawn if so check out this huge Pack full
02:28 - of sci-fi dinos the model are all really
02:30 - awesome very unique some very inventive
02:32 - character designs in total this features
02:34 - seven models each with three skin
02:36 - variations and lots and lots of
02:38 - animations included then here's a fun
02:39 - one 3D emojis these actually come in
02:42 - modular parts so you can mix and match
02:44 - to get tons of variation it comes with
02:46 - custom editor scripts to make it really
02:48 - easy to customize so this is the kind of
02:50 - thing that would be really excellent for
02:51 - giving a game a little bit of extra
02:53 - depth maybe you could spawn these 3D
02:54 - emojis on top of your character when
02:56 - they do something or when they say some
02:58 - kind of message then if you need tons of
03:00 - super high quality VFX check out this
03:01 - one you've got lots of great looking
03:03 - effects all in a realistic fantasy style
03:05 - these were also made in VFX gra and Shad
03:08 - graph so you can also inspect all these
03:09 - effects to see exactly how exactly do
03:11 - they work or maybe you're building some
03:13 - kind of farm or zoo tycoon game if so
03:15 - look at this one it's a pack with a ton
03:17 - of farm animals so you've got cows balls
03:20 - horses pigs all of them in a really nice
03:22 - cartoony style the proportions are very
03:24 - stylized and each of them also comes
03:26 - with a nice set of animations next
03:27 - here's a fun one some nice quar
03:30 - transitions these are perfect for
03:31 - polishing your loading screens or really
03:33 - any scene transition you can tint it in
03:35 - any color so even though it looks like
03:37 - liquid this could be something like
03:39 - water slime or lava then if you need
03:41 - some nice animated icons look at these
03:43 - ones making your icons animated is a
03:45 - really nice and easy way to add a tiny
03:47 - bit of pish your game you can make them
03:49 - static once on idle and then animate
03:51 - them on mouseover you've got loading
03:53 - icons Wi-Fi icons there's some bar
03:55 - charts you've got some texts messages
03:57 - gears notes and tons more or perhaps
03:59 - you're game is pixel art if so look at
04:01 - this nice monster pack they are pretty
04:03 - tiny they're 128x 128 in total you've
04:06 - got 100 Sprites with multiple animations
04:08 - so this could be really great in some
04:10 - kind of pixel art RTS or maybe some kind
04:12 - of God game or Village Fantasy game then
04:15 - if you're a fan of the Matrix and you
04:16 - want the Shader effect that looks just
04:18 - like that if so then look at this one it
04:20 - is exactly what you expect you've got
04:22 - lots of green characters moving around
04:24 - so very simple and if this is the style
04:25 - you're going for then this makes it look
04:27 - really great then for an animation Punk
04:29 - here here is some survival Locomotion
04:31 - survival means you have the usual normal
04:33 - walking idle crouching animations and so
04:35 - on but then you also have animations for
04:37 - applying a medkit there's one for eating
04:40 - taking some pills grabbing some items
04:41 - setting up a campfire you can also do
04:43 - some punches and some simple parkour so
04:45 - if you combine this with nice character
04:47 - and nice Force environment you have a
04:49 - pretty decent Survival game next if you
04:51 - need something more Jolly here's a cute
04:53 - Town asset pack it's very nice got some
04:55 - very vibrant colors everything is really
04:58 - nice in cuboid the demo scene also looks
05:00 - like it could be a great starting point
05:01 - for some kind of City Adventure game or
05:03 - maybe a cute tiny GTA game just had a
05:05 - car controller to control these cars and
05:07 - walk around and do quest for some kind
05:09 - of cute characters on the other hand if
05:11 - you want something really creepy and
05:12 - look at this fantasy monster it's a very
05:14 - weird creature with multiple faces and a
05:16 - strange skin this one actually comes
05:18 - with detailed facial expressions to make
05:20 - it even more creepy so if you'd like to
05:21 - make a horror game usually those are
05:23 - really just based on having a single
05:25 - really interesting enemy and if so then
05:27 - this one would fit great next if you're
05:28 - making some kind of band simulat game
05:30 - look at these characters they are really
05:32 - nice and Anime likee this pack includes
05:34 - the characters plus the instruments and
05:35 - the animations finding an animation pack
05:37 - for playing some music is actually quite
05:39 - difficult so if you'd like to make a
05:40 - game like this then this looks like the
05:42 - perfect pack then for some fun props
05:43 - here are some stylized barrels it's a
05:45 - very simple pack you've got an empty
05:47 - Barrel there's one with some water and
05:49 - one with some really nice cartoony
05:50 - Dynamite then if your game is cartoony
05:52 - and you need some characters look at
05:53 - these two it has two great characters I
05:55 - love the style very unique it seems like
05:57 - this is actually a new publisher so I
05:59 - hope they make more characters in this
06:00 - same style or if your dream is to make a
06:02 - game like Tony hwk then here's a great
06:04 - starting point it's a pack with a bunch
06:06 - of skateboards and longboards features
06:08 - lots of interesting designs I think
06:09 - they'll look really great all right so
06:11 - those are my top 20 new visual assets on
06:12 - the unity asseta for May 24 there's
