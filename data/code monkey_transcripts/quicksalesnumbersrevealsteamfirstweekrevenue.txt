00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your K Mony so
00:02 - quick update my game has now been out
00:04 - for a week and here are the first week's
00:06 - numbers I will do a full video later on
00:08 - with my full thoughts but I want to make
00:09 - a quick first week update since the
00:11 - first week usually matters quite a lot
00:13 - if you haven't picked it up yet check it
00:15 - out on Steam and if you do have it
00:16 - please write review it is currently at
00:18 - just under 50 reviews I'd love to hit 50
00:21 - which would put the game in another seam
00:22 - review bucket which can usually help
00:23 - with visibility by the way if you're
00:25 - wondering why does my voice sound so
00:27 - weird that's because I just ran my first
00:29 - marathon yesterday I was completely
00:31 - broken and barely met it across the
00:32 - finish line and today my body is still
00:35 - very much recovering anyway so the
00:36 - numbers are pretty good especially
00:38 - considering how it's just the first week
00:40 - it is guiding towards selling over a
00:41 - th000 copies within the first month so
00:44 - it looks like it w hit my first month
00:45 - goals and of course this is also really
00:47 - good considering how I made such an
00:49 - insanely complex game in just 6 months
00:51 - I'm definitely very happy with myself in
00:53 - terms of productivity and my skills as a
00:55 - Game Dev and programmer the amount of
00:56 - code that I wrote in such a short amount
00:58 - of time is really quite surprising even
01:00 - to myself and it's all really high
01:02 - quality code there's only a handful of
01:03 - places where I made something quick and
01:04 - dirty but for the vast majority like 95%
01:07 - of the code it's all really well
01:08 - structured so I'm definitely very happy
01:10 - with how much I've grown as a programmer
01:12 - since my last game this is why I'm
01:14 - constantly talking about the importance
01:15 - of experience it's because I can see the
01:17 - tremendous value it has in my own skills
01:19 - and in terms of the game itself honestly
01:21 - I'm really happy with it one fun thing
01:23 - that happened to me was on release day
01:24 - I've been working non-stop this past
01:26 - month and especially for the past two
01:27 - weeks in all that time I've played the
01:29 - game a lot but mostly just for testing
01:31 - not really to have fun and then on
01:33 - release day I finally published the game
01:35 - at 9:00 p.m. and I wanted to stay up for
01:36 - a while longer just make sure there
01:38 - weren't any major game breaking bugs
01:39 - that I missed so since I had to wait for
01:41 - about an hour for people to start
01:43 - playing the game and get some feedback
01:44 - in that time I just lied down on my
01:46 - couch I picked up my steam deck and I
01:47 - started playing normally and honestly I
01:49 - really enjoyed it I thought I would just
01:51 - play for 20 minutes but end up playing
01:53 - for almost 1 hour non-stop this one this
01:55 - is my ninth steam game but this is the
01:57 - very first time that I've made a game
01:58 - that I've played on a console and I have
02:00 - to say that felt pretty magical holding
02:02 - a portable gaming device just like a
02:04 - Game Boy that I had when I was a kid
02:06 - doing that and playing my own game that
02:08 - really felt really awesome that was
02:09 - definitely a great experience and the
02:11 - game itself in terms of design is also
02:13 - something that I'm really proud of and
02:14 - like I said the code is all really high
02:16 - quality which means it is really easy to
02:18 - expand modify which also means that my
02:20 - mind is already filled with so many
02:22 - ideas of where I can go next but right
02:24 - now I'm really fighting the urge to
02:26 - think about any future big expansions
02:28 - right now I'm really focused on adding
02:29 - something things that I just didn't have
02:30 - time before release I've been putting
02:32 - out updates every single day sometimes
02:34 - two updates per day and reading tons and
02:36 - tons of feedback so thank you all so
02:38 - much for all of your feedback there were
02:40 - a bunch of very strange very rare bugs
02:42 - that I only managed to fix thanks to all
02:44 - of your help beyond that I also wanted
02:45 - to make this quick video before I
02:47 - started publishing normal videos I asked
02:48 - you for what systems you'd like to see
02:50 - tutorials for and I've been adding those
02:52 - to my list hopefully I should be able to
02:54 - start working on those this week now
02:55 - that the game is pretty stable one of
02:57 - the ones that I really want to do and
02:58 - that a lot of people have mentioned is
03:00 - character customization the other day I
03:02 - checked out the N accur which is
03:03 - currently having a sale and the asset
03:05 - that I used for my own characters this
03:08 - pack with tons of characters tons of
03:09 - body parts this one is currently
03:10 - discounted it would be great timing if I
03:13 - had that tutorial done already but I
03:14 - still need to actually make that video
03:16 - from scratch so I can only put that one
03:18 - out later this month but if you're
03:19 - interested in character customization
03:21 - maybe pick up this pack while it's on
03:22 - discount and stay tuned for tutorial
03:24 - there's a link in the description and
03:25 - another great asset that I also use in
03:27 - my game that is also part of this sale
03:28 - is over here the text animator this is a
03:30 - really excellent asset it's really EAS
03:32 - to use personally I use it to polish up
03:34 - the tax in my game just making it
03:36 - automatically right in a super simple
03:38 - way it's a tiny thing but it really
03:39 - helps the game feel much more polished
03:41 - so this is another simple tool that I
03:43 - highly recommend and speaking of just
03:45 - Tools in general this topic is actually
03:47 - one that I want to cover in a future
03:48 - video basically what assets help make my
03:50 - game a reality both in terms of paid
03:52 - assets and also which ones of my own
03:54 - systems that I've made in previous
03:55 - videos which ones of those did I reuse
03:57 - in making this game the answer is quite
03:59 - a lot lot so I'm planning to make a
04:01 - video of all the systems and assets that
04:03 - I use and reuse and if you're a fan of
04:05 - the low po sound there's also a c hum
04:07 - bundle if you like their style then
04:08 - these humble mods are always excellent
04:10 - deals as you wait for me to make all the
04:12 - tutorials related for the game a lot of
04:14 - the Core Concepts behind it like the
04:15 - interaction System state machines CLE
04:17 - code separation and so on a lot of that
04:19 - are things that I've already covered in
04:21 - my two free courses actually the whole
04:23 - idea for this game started after I
04:24 - finished my multiplayer course and I
04:25 - wanted to make some multiplayer game in
04:28 - fact if you look at the lobby logic in
04:29 - the final game you'll see how it's
04:31 - pretty much exactly the same as what was
04:32 - originally built in that course so
04:34 - anyways yep these are the numbers for
04:36 - the first week stay tuned for the full
04:37 - video with my full thoughts sometime
04:39 - near the end of this month if you don't
04:41 - yet own the game go ahead and get it and
04:43 - if you do have it I hope you're enjoying
04:44 - it and please ride review it really does
04:46 - help all right so stay tuned for the
04:48 - return of regular videos coming soon
04:50 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
04:51 - next time
