01:30 - Flash deal is on the shops back this one
01:31 - is really awesome if you want to make
01:33 - some kind of M tycoon game there are
01:34 - also two great humble bundles there's
01:37 - one with tons of Blended courses and
01:38 - materials I followed this one myself
01:41 - quite a while ago and I really enjoyed
01:42 - it I really learned a lot and there's
01:44 - also a bundle with a massive amount of
01:45 - Tod Sprites lots of characters cars
01:48 - environments space pack UI pack and tons
01:50 - more those are all Linked In the
01:51 - description which is usual those are all
01:53 - affiliate links so if you buy anything
01:54 - through those links it's the same price
01:56 - to you and I get a nice commission all
01:57 - right so starting off with a system that
01:59 - does EX only what it says it's a parkour
02:01 - and climbing system if you've been
02:03 - playing the recent Assassin's Creed and
02:05 - you'd like to build something like that
02:06 - then this could be a great starting
02:07 - point the animations are a little bit
02:09 - stted but it works exactly as you expect
02:11 - it features some regular box climbing
02:13 - you can jump on some edges you can swing
02:15 - from bars jump from edge to edge you can
02:17 - Vault balance and tons more to create a
02:20 - climb point you just select an object in
02:21 - the level and use the included tool to
02:23 - mark it as climbable swingable mountable
02:25 - and so on then the character is smart
02:27 - enough to identify the nearby climb
02:28 - point and select the an a mission now I
02:30 - must say this is one system that I've
02:32 - always wanted to research for myself
02:33 - when I played the recent Assassin's
02:35 - Creed it made me want to research that
02:36 - even more so hopefully in the future
02:38 - I'll have some more time to research
02:39 - this topic but if you just want a tool
02:41 - that just works then check this one out
02:43 - next is something that a lot of games
02:44 - have like for example Assassin's Creed
02:46 - which is a navigation system this one is
02:48 - actually not just one element but rather
02:51 - a ton of tracking and navigation
02:52 - elements all in one single pack you've
02:54 - got a radar kind of like a minimap then
02:56 - you've got a flat Compass like in
02:58 - something like Skyrim you've got some
02:59 - onscreen indicators some Edge arrows and
03:01 - tons more it's made by Infinity PVR so
03:04 - all the scripts are really very nicely
03:06 - detailed and very well put together and
03:08 - it also comes with some video tutorials
03:09 - to help you get started so if you need
03:11 - to guide your players in some way then a
03:12 - tool like this one can save you a ton of
03:14 - time then here's one that I hope doesn't
03:16 - get this video demonetized it's called
03:17 - Gore simulator like name implies it lets
03:19 - you create different body parts of a
03:21 - mesh and then slice them during gameplay
03:23 - it doesn't have to be horror game Gore
03:25 - doesn't have to be something super
03:26 - intense it can just be something like
03:28 - Doom where you have enemies and you just
03:30 - want them to blow up into various pieces
03:32 - or simply maybe some skeletons kind of
03:34 - like Skyrim where you really just want
03:36 - them to break into bones it includes a
03:38 - custom Editor to make it super easy to
03:40 - use you just assign a skin mesh render
03:42 - pick a button and it automatically
03:43 - creates all the colliders and all the
03:45 - various separated body parts if you have
03:47 - some kind of action game then this is
03:49 - one of those things that can easily be
03:50 - added with a tone like this one and it
03:52 - can really help take your game to the
03:53 - next level next here's a super simple
03:55 - one emojis for textmesh pro this one
03:58 - adds actual emojis to text smh Pro so
04:00 - this is not just a Sprite pack with this
04:02 - you can copy paste actual emojis like
04:04 - text emojis you can copy paste them into
04:06 - regular text objects and they won't be
04:08 - rendered perfectly it comes with a
04:09 - pre-built Sprite asset with the most
04:11 - popular emojis but also allows you to
04:13 - create custom Sprite asset if you want
04:14 - to use some different icons basically
04:16 - it's a simple tool that does exactly
04:17 - what it says if you have some kind of
04:19 - chat system in your game then this could
04:20 - be a nice way to make it a little bit
04:22 - more special then here we have one to
04:24 - help you polish up your world it's some
04:25 - Cloud Shadows this lets you create
04:27 - clouds of various shapes and then you
04:29 - can watch your shadows that those clouds
04:31 - cast directly on the floor this is one
04:33 - of those really subtle things that you
04:34 - never really notice but as soon as you
04:36 - add it you do see a massive difference
04:38 - you can modify a ton of properties on
04:39 - the clouds you can make them thicker or
04:41 - thinner move fast or slow you can change
04:43 - the color the randomness the animation
04:45 - and tons of more parameters really this
04:46 - is a great way to make your world feel
04:48 - much more alive up next here's a great
04:50 - one for helping you keep track of your
04:51 - time now for me a long time ago I did
04:53 - use to track my time I had a program
04:55 - that would track every single second
04:57 - although nowadays since I'm pretty much
04:58 - working all the time I don't really use
05:00 - it anymore but a tool like this one can
05:01 - be quite useful especially if you're
05:03 - making games on the side and you really
05:04 - want to keep track of how much time it
05:06 - takes you to build something this one is
05:07 - a simple tool that tracks time both
05:09 - active and idle it tracks the start and
05:11 - end times and then shows it all in some
05:13 - nice graphs and pie charts then for
05:15 - another relatively simple one here is a
05:17 - Color Picker UI it does exactly what you
05:19 - want lets you pick some colors it
05:20 - includes a bunch of templates so you can
05:22 - pick the one that you want this one is a
05:24 - great tool to include alongside some
05:26 - kind of modding tools in your game you
05:28 - can use it to let the player custom
05:29 - their player character player color logo
05:31 - color or really anything then here's a
05:33 - tool designed to help solve something
05:35 - that every game has to deal with which
05:37 - is bootstrapping just with a few clicks
05:39 - you can define a bootstrap scene and
05:41 - execute essential code before starting
05:43 - the regular gameplay so things like for
05:45 - example a sound manager or a music
05:46 - manager object or maybe in multiplayer
05:48 - game something like a network manager
05:49 - you really need those objects to be
05:51 - initialized before going into regular
05:52 - gameplay with tool like this one you can
05:54 - easily automate that process by simply
05:56 - implementing an interface and then it
05:58 - will automatically make sure those
05:59 - objects are initialized before the game
06:00 - play so this looks like a nice and
06:02 - simple tool to solve a really common
06:04 - problem next every game has tutorials
06:06 - which you need to build in some way so
06:07 - here's a tool to help that you define
06:09 - each tutorial stage you run some custom
06:11 - code on stage start or end then Define
06:13 - all the conditions to complete that
06:15 - stage you can easily make it based on
06:17 - some distance between two objects make
06:19 - it based on time clicks or really
06:20 - trigger it manually with the events for
06:22 - the stage start and end you can easily
06:24 - set up some visuals to guide the player
06:25 - throughout the tutorial there's a bunch
06:27 - of tools like this one and this one
06:28 - seems to be one of the better with a
06:29 - really nice watch then if you normally
06:31 - work on multiple objects this tool
06:33 - sounds really great it helps you link
06:35 - multiple projects together and then you
06:36 - can share assets between them so
06:38 - basically you share a folder and in that
06:39 - folder you place whatever assets you
06:41 - want and all the projects that are
06:42 - linking to that folder all of them can
06:44 - use the same assets this can be super
06:46 - useful to save space if you use the same
06:48 - assets all over the place in several
06:49 - projects so this one looks like a pretty
06:51 - simple to use but also very capable all
06:53 - right so that's the top 10 new systems
06:55 - and tools now on to the top 20 new
06:57 - visuals list all right so so starting
06:59 - off with a really nice looking pack for
07:01 - making an RTS or a tower defense game
07:03 - every time I see one of these packs it
07:05 - makes me want to make an RTS but then I
07:07 - remember that genre takes a massive
07:09 - amount of work and I'm already so busy
07:10 - so I can't really do it but if you do
07:12 - have the time and you want to make an
07:13 - RTS then a pack like this is perfect
07:15 - you've got tons of units all with some
07:17 - really nice animations there's eight
07:19 - Towers each with three levels of
07:20 - upgrades there's various buildings
07:22 - vehicles and planes all with some really
07:23 - nice colors which you can obviously
07:25 - recolor for multiple players or maybe
07:27 - you need a really high quality really
07:29 - unique Mech T-Rex look at this one I
07:31 - love the model it's an excellent look
07:33 - excellent style and it also comes with
07:34 - some great looking animations this dev
07:37 - has tons more mechanical dinosaurs so
07:39 - with a bunch of these maybe you can
07:40 - build something like Horizon zero Dawn
07:43 - then if you have some voxon prototype
07:45 - that you'd like to build check out this
07:46 - one it features a ton of cube like
07:48 - objects that you can use to build entire
07:50 - worlds you could either use this to make
07:52 - some pre-made Maps or you can give them
07:54 - to the player alongside some kind of
07:56 - building system to build something like
07:57 - Minecraft features a little bit of of
07:59 - everything with some very unique biomes
08:01 - next if you need a great modern UI pack

08:28 - an entire town with enem objects and
08:30 - fully interal buildings so this is one
08:32 - of those packs where if you just enjoy
08:33 - building things and you can just have
08:35 - fun with this pack without even having
08:36 - to make an entire game next if you need

08:58 - Japan I'd love to go someday but based
09:00 - on all the anime that I've seen this

09:26 - of medical apps with unity this is all
09:28 - super realistic and I assume it's all
09:30 - medically accurate at least based on
09:32 - what I know from working out all the
09:33 - muscles seem to be correct it's
09:35 - interesting how the fat distribution for
09:36 - the model seems to have something like
09:38 - 8% body fat in the ABS but then 15% legs
09:41 - so pretty much just like a fitness
09:42 - influencer you've got more shapes to
09:44 - modify the size for all kinds of organs
