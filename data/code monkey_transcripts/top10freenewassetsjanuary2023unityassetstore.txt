00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the asosaurus full of awesome tones and
00:04 - asks to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - January 23. in this first video I'll be
00:11 - covering a list of free assets and next
00:13 - ones I'll be covering paid ads and tools
00:15 - let me know in the comments if you pick
00:16 - up any of these and what you intend to
00:17 - do with them by the way quick update I'm
00:20 - still hard to work on my upcoming free
00:21 - course this will end up a lot more
00:23 - detail than I anticipated the core
00:25 - script is a massive 7000 lines long and
00:27 - I still have a few lectures left to
00:29 - right the recording and editing should
00:30 - hopefully go quickly so I'm hoping to
00:32 - have it out by mid to late January
00:33 - alright so on to the top 10 list
00:35 - starting off with a nice pack with a
00:37 - whole bunch of status effects these are
00:39 - always useful for just about any game
00:41 - this pack features three Buffs one
00:43 - debuff and one status element it's up to
00:45 - you to Define what they all mean and you
00:47 - could also recolor them to get some more
00:49 - variation then if you're making a 2d
00:51 - game and you want some Undead Survivor
00:53 - assets look at this one it's got some
00:55 - really nice pixel art great if you'd
00:57 - like to make a quick Survival on
00:59 - Prototype I either top down or side
01:01 - scroller it's actually a pre-complete
01:03 - pack you have some four tiles some items
01:05 - three tools three weapons some humans
01:07 - and some Undead really nice if instead
01:10 - you want something much more high-end
01:11 - then look at this part this nav has tons
01:14 - of assets all of them insanely high
01:16 - quality they are super detailed models
01:18 - with 8K textures this character has a
01:20 - humanoid rig it has a bunch of modular
01:22 - pieces and even has some cloth physics
01:25 - this one is a really nice sample so if
01:27 - you don't like this sound definitely
01:28 - check out this entire Publishers page
01:30 - next for an interesting tool here is
01:32 - smart console one asset that I've
01:35 - recommended so many times is quantum
01:36 - console this one seems to be trying to
01:39 - do the same thing but as a free package
01:40 - it looks very capable you just add the
01:43 - command attribute and you can easily
01:44 - trigger a function from an in-game
01:46 - console very useful then if you'd like
01:48 - to build an entire medieval town here is
01:50 - a nice modular pack it's in low poly
01:52 - cartoon fantasy it's a pretty nice pack
01:55 - with quite a lot of variety you could
01:57 - definitely build a huge sprawling City
01:58 - by mixing and matching all these pieces
02:00 - if you like this then this step also has
02:02 - tons more great low poly acids next if
02:05 - you need to take lots of screenshots
02:07 - with all kinds of sizes then this one
02:09 - looks very useful it features an easy to
02:11 - use menu where you can fill in all of
02:13 - the resolutions you need along with the
02:14 - name and with a button press you can
02:16 - automatically take on screenshots and
02:18 - save them so if you're publishing a game
02:20 - on lots of devices or platforms then
02:22 - this can definitely help then for
02:24 - another tool here we have lazy Builder
02:26 - this one is extremely interesting
02:28 - basically it's a library funnel of cc0
02:30 - assets meaning assets that you are free
02:32 - to use in free or commercial games
02:34 - although even though it has that many
02:36 - assets it's also very lightweight the
02:38 - assets aren't actually included in the
02:40 - package they're only downloaded when you
02:42 - actually need them so the tone itself is
02:44 - only 5 megabytes it comes with 500 sh
02:46 - but you can easily add more by creating
02:48 - your own Library all in all a very
02:50 - interesting tool if you want to make VR
02:52 - games then look at this one to help you
02:54 - handle interactions it features lots of
02:57 - interesting interactions you can
02:58 - obviously pick up and drop objects you
03:00 - can phone levers and so on but also some
03:02 - interesting ones like handling a screw
03:04 - it's made by a very well established
03:06 - studio with years of experience this one
03:08 - is a free version but in terms of
03:09 - features it seems pretty complete the
03:12 - main limitation is no commercial use so
03:14 - you can try this out for free and if it
03:16 - helps you make your own game then you
03:17 - can pick up the phone version then for
03:19 - another very simple tool here is a
03:21 - c-sharp generator basically you can just
03:23 - Define some settings for creating a new
03:24 - c-sharp file like pre-adding some
03:26 - musings or defining a namespace then
03:28 - with one click you can easily create all
03:30 - of those templates for me I'm a pretty
03:32 - fast typer and my brain subconsciously
03:34 - edits the default template immediately
03:35 - but if you'd like to save a few seconds
03:37 - then this could be useful next up for an
03:39 - interesting side scroller 2D pack here
03:41 - is neighborhood it has quite a lot of
03:43 - pieces you have a background and a whole
03:46 - ton of foreground elements everything
03:47 - for a house with a whole bunch of
03:49 - Interiors so I'm looking at all of this
03:51 - really makes me want to build a quick
03:53 - prototype of something like the Sims
03:54 - from a side-srolling perspective I think
03:56 - that would look really nice alright so
03:58 - those are my top 10 free new assets on
04:00 - the NTS store for January 23 there's
04:02 - links on the description also check out
04:04 - my own free and paint S1 store alright
