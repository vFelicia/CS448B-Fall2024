00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're continuing to
00:03 - make the demo man from Team Fortress 2
00:05 - in unity we're going to recreate the
00:07 - sticky grenade launcher it will fire
00:09 - sticky grenades that we can then
00:10 - manually trigger to explode let's get
00:13 - started
00:17 - so I have the scene here from the
00:19 - previous video with my given man walking
00:21 - around and firing bouncing grenades they
00:24 - bounce off walls and they explode when
00:26 - they hit enemies we're going to replace
00:28 - that with sticky grenades that we can
00:30 - explode on command okay so let's start
00:35 - off by creating a new prefab and name it
00:38 - PF sticky grenade we're going to add
00:43 - first a sprite renderer and drag the
00:46 - sticky grenade sprite then we're going
00:48 - to add a rigidbody to Dean
00:51 - leave it with no physics material set
00:54 - the mast to one when you're dragged to
00:56 - three angular to gravity to zero since
01:00 - this is in top-down perspective add a
01:03 - circle Collider 2d set the radius to
01:07 - about one point three yeah about that a
01:10 - little but smaller than the actual
01:12 - sprite and let's make it a trigger so it
01:15 - doesn't constantly fire events okay so
01:17 - we have our basic prefab want to make
01:20 - the script new c-sharp script name it
01:22 - sticky renamed now in here our code is
01:26 - going to be very similar to our bouncy
01:28 - grenades so we're going to start off
01:29 - with a static creator and we can
01:31 - actually just copy it from here copy it
01:36 - instead of getting a prefab for Consular
01:38 - now and let's say it's the prefab for
01:40 - sticking her name we're also going to
01:42 - receive a spawn position a target
01:44 - position and using system an action that
01:48 - won't take the factor 3 that won't be
01:50 - triggered on explode
01:52 - this won't be a sticky grenade and
01:55 - rename all this too sticky or night ok
02:00 - great now let's create our setup
02:02 - function so going here where I have all
02:05 - this
02:08 - let's make our member variables so an
02:11 - action which won't take a vector3 called
02:13 - on explode action okay so in here we
02:18 - have our target position the action that
02:20 - will trigger an explode we have the move
02:24 - direction point it towards the target
02:27 - position based on our transform position
02:28 - and we got our move speedin we are
02:31 - setting the velocity now for our bombs
02:34 - grenades we were just setting a basic mu
02:36 - speed but for our sticky grenades we
02:38 - want to have a bit more control over
02:40 - where they're going so we're going to
02:42 - set the move speed dependent on the
02:44 - distance to our target so let's
02:46 - calculate hello
02:47 - distance will be vector 3 dot distance
02:50 - between our transform dot position and
02:53 - the target position and for our move
02:57 - spin we're going to make it based on the
02:59 - distance and let's say multiply it by 4
03:02 - that makes it a very nice number now we
03:05 - want this to have a minimum and a
03:07 - maximum Cemetery math F dot clamp and
03:11 - we're going to clamp this value between
03:13 - let's say a minimum of 50 and a maximum
03:16 - of 250 okay so this way if we click
03:21 - close to the character it's only going
03:23 - to fire for a short distance if we click
03:26 - very far away to into fire with a high
03:28 - speed and let's also add some angular
03:31 - velocity so game object I'll get
03:33 - component a type rigidbody and let's set
03:37 - the angular velocity - let's say - 1000
03:41 - F so it's going to go in clockwise
03:45 - motion since this is a sticky grenade we
03:47 - wanted to stop moving when it actually
03:49 - hits something we set up our circle
03:51 - Collider
03:52 - as a trigger so we're going to go into
03:54 - private void on trigger enter 2 D now
03:58 - when we actually hit something we want
04:00 - to stop moving so let's make a private
04:04 - void stop moving and in here in order to
04:08 - stop moving we're simply going to
04:10 - destroy our physics object
04:15 - destroy the rigidbody2d and also the
04:19 - circle Collider 2d so this way when the
04:23 - trigger is called it won't destroy the
04:25 - physics objects and don't just stop in
04:28 - place and there's an effect let's also
04:30 - add the simulated vertical movement from
04:33 - our bouncy grenades so we can grab
04:35 - exactly the same code go in here and so
04:41 - just set the private ins bomb state set
04:49 - the bomb state to zero
04:50 - and there you go okay so this won't just
04:52 - simulate vertical movement so let's go
04:55 - into our Kim Hanul script and spawn a
04:58 - sticky renamed I have here the same
05:01 - thing from the last video and in here on
05:04 - shoot instead of spawning a bouncy
05:06 - grenade I want to spawn eight stick you
05:08 - learn it it takes in the same parameters
05:11 - but let's switch out the prefab so the
05:13 - prefab for the sticky or name and go up
05:17 - here now the pre-con for the sticky for
05:20 - a name go back into our scene at the
05:23 - reference to our sticky grenade prefab
05:25 - and on the prefab let's add our sticky
05:28 - grenade script okay good let's test it
05:33 - out and see if the green is being
05:34 - spawned okay so as you can see the C
05:39 - grenades are being correctly spawned
05:41 - when they hit an enemy they stop in
05:43 - their current position if they had a
05:45 - wall they do the same thing and we have
05:48 - the vertical simulated movement we've
05:50 - got some angular rotation and works
05:55 - great and as you can see if I can look
05:57 - very far away it gets fired quite far
06:00 - but if I click close to my character it
06:01 - only fires a little bit okay now we
06:05 - actually want it to explode so let's do
06:07 - that
06:08 - back into our code here we're going to
06:11 - trigger the explosion on a right mouse
06:13 - button click so in here let's set up a
06:16 - private void update and if input dot get
06:21 - mouse button down
06:23 - of mouse button one which is the right
06:25 - mouse button when you hit that in here
06:28 - we want to explode so in order to
06:30 - explode all our grenades we're going to
06:32 - leave that responsibility to this sticky
06:34 - grenade class so we're going to go into
06:37 - the see grenade and create a new
06:39 - function that won't trigger the
06:41 - explosion on every single grenade so
06:43 - we're going to call it something like
06:45 - explode all grenades okay so let's go
06:49 - and make that back in here we're going
06:52 - to make a poly static void explode all
06:57 - our names
06:59 - so in order to explode we near the
07:01 - reference for all of our grenade so
07:03 - let's make a profit static list of
07:06 - sticky grenade and call it sticky
07:10 - grenade lists and in here when we create
07:14 - our grenade we're going to first of all
07:16 - initialize the list if it is no equals
07:22 - in you list and we're going to add our
07:25 - new sticky grenade now in our explode we
07:30 - are simply going to do a for each for
07:33 - each sticking our name and our sticking
07:38 - with name list you're going to have a
07:41 - function called explode grenade and then
07:46 - we're going to clear our list okay let's
07:50 - make our a close we renamed go down here
07:53 - private void exploit grenade and here we
07:58 - want to destroy our game object and we
08:01 - want to trigger our function on explode
08:04 - action with our transform.position okay
08:09 - so when we call this function it's going
08:12 - to trigger exfoli grenade on every
08:14 - single grenade and then reset the list
08:16 - and every time it's created it gets
08:18 - added to the list and own least itself
08:20 - gets instantiated if it doesn't exist
08:22 - yet okay great
08:24 - everything is looking good so let's go
08:26 - and test it out back into our scene and
08:29 - see if it's working exactly as intended
08:31 - I have my wall there I can fire the wall
08:34 - and boom
08:35 - my exponents in fire the enemy boom
08:37 - there he goes okay as you can see we can
08:40 - now spawn and trigger boom and they all
08:43 - explode okay so there you have it we
08:49 - have created our sticky grenade based on
08:52 - our previous bouncy grenade
08:53 - we made it stopped moving when it hit
08:55 - something set to move this and stays on
08:57 - where we click and make home grenades
08:59 - explode on command on the next video
09:02 - we're going to cover weapon reloading
09:03 - and limited ammo as always you can
09:06 - download the project files and utilities
09:07 - from Unity code monkey comm if you have
09:10 - any questions post them in the comments
09:12 - and I'll do my best answer okay see you
09:13 - next
