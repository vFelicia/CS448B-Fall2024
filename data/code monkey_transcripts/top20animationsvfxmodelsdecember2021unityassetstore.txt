01:19 - description all right so starting off
01:21 - with the latest cinti pack sci-fi worlds

01:25 - poly style this one is a massive pack
01:28 - there's over 1200 prefabs everything you
01:31 - can imagine in a sci-fi setting
01:33 - you've got tons of characters vehicles
01:35 - buildings lots of weapons and vfx
01:38 - of it in three different unique factions
01:40 - and several unique environments then if
01:42 - you need a giant pack with some awesome
01:45 - reverse doom plate and missions then
01:47 - look at this one
01:48 - dual wielding is always fun and even
01:50 - more fun when it's a reverse grip
01:52 - features all kind of animations so the
01:54 - usual attack combo hit jump move and
01:56 - equip and as usual these are all
01:58 - humanoid animations so they work with
02:00 - any humanoid characters this developer
02:02 - has tons of really awesome animations so
02:04 - if you like this style check it out
02:06 - then if you're making some kind of
02:08 - office management game or something like
02:09 - the sims then look at these stylized
02:12 - businessmen
02:13 - they are low poly but not too low poly
02:15 - it's a pretty nice cartoony style
02:17 - features five unique models each of them
02:19 - with three hairstyles and tons of outfit
02:21 - variations or maybe you're making a game
02:23 - where you need some sort of detective or
02:25 - eagle vision then check out this one
02:28 - it throws out a pulse and then
02:29 - highlights all the enemies or objects
02:31 - and you can see them even through walls
02:33 - so this is just like the detective mode
02:35 - in the arkham games or even econ vision
02:38 - in assassin's creed it's a pretty nice
02:40 - effect and i'm guessing you can even
02:42 - modify the shaders to make it fit
02:43 - whatever game style you have up next
02:45 - here's a pack with a bunch of really
02:47 - nice monsters in total 20 characters
02:50 - a bunch of dragons stone monsters dryads
02:52 - and bears it's a really nice style very
02:55 - fantastical this one is the fourth
02:57 - volume so if you like this style check
02:59 - out the others or maybe you need a
03:01 - massive amount of rpg weapons then look
03:03 - at this pack of them in a low poly style
03:06 - everything from swords to bows maces
03:09 - shields and saps and each of them also
03:11 - has 64 color variations so the actual
03:14 - total for this is a massive 25 000
03:16 - unique combinations up next some more
03:19 - really cool animations this one is all
03:21 - about pistols
03:22 - but it's much more than just normal

03:58 - cool animation pack is this one it's an
04:00 - office pack which looks pretty funny
04:02 - given how the characters they use is a

04:31 - borders and tons of horse so i could see
04:34 - this one as a great starting point for

05:55 - to life if you need tons of icons and
05:57 - here's a great one they're all in a flat
