00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your cut monkey
00:01 - and earlier this week I made a video
00:04 - doing a quick recap on the unity GDC
00:06 - roadmap Tonk which covered what is
00:08 - coming with the engine in the near
00:09 - future however one very important thing
00:11 - that was mysteriously absent from the
00:12 - road map but was announced on that very
00:14 - same night was Yin Tai it was somewhat
00:17 - quietly announced just on Twitter the
00:19 - YouTube video is still enlisted which
00:20 - means it's not public now I say
00:22 - announcement but it really is just a
00:23 - teaser really nothing in terms of
00:25 - concrete details and because that the
00:27 - response was pretty negative a handful
00:29 - of people are excited most are skeptical
00:31 - or really just very negative and that's
00:33 - not really without reason AI is a very
00:36 - sensitive topic that can be done either
00:37 - in a positive or negative way and in
00:40 - this case we just how limited this
00:41 - teaser is and how it doesn't really have
00:43 - any details on anything I don't blame
00:45 - people for having a negative reaction
00:47 - however like I mentioned in the GDC
00:49 - video Unity invited me over there and I
00:51 - attended a private tunnel where I got
00:52 - the chance to take a look at behind the
00:54 - scenes and I saw the current state of a
00:56 - bunch of AI tools they are working on
00:57 - that talk was very much behind and then
00:59 - EA so I'm not allowed to talk about
01:01 - specifics but still I can talk about
01:03 - some things you can also sign up to
01:05 - their AI beta if you want to learn more
01:06 - I've signed up myself so here I'm going
01:08 - to cover three common questions that I
01:10 - saw as a response to the announcement
01:11 - and just AI in general so first is Unity
01:14 - announcing something quickly just to
01:16 - please investors which will then be
01:17 - dropped secondly are they doing AI
01:19 - ethically or carelessly and thirdly is
01:21 - Unity considering consent and legal
01:23 - issues in the data sets they are using
01:25 - those are very very important questions
01:27 - and the unity team had answers to all of
01:29 - them but before those I actually had a
01:30 - question of my own I asked them why
01:32 - announces quietly overnight instead of
01:34 - doing the roadmap talk it seems like
01:36 - this should really be present on the
01:37 - roadmap and the answer that I got has to
01:39 - do with how they are researching tons of
01:41 - things and they already have quite a lot
01:42 - working but there's a huge difference
01:44 - between making a quick working prototype
01:46 - and building a proper production ready
01:48 - tune so they have essentially learned
01:50 - the lesson from dots where they showcase
01:52 - it right away in the very very early
01:53 - stages and then a bunch of people were
01:55 - regularly upset when many years came and
01:57 - went and dots was constantly stuck in
01:59 - development so they learned from that
02:01 - and now they want to make sure they only
02:03 - show something concrete when they are
02:04 - very confident they have an actual
02:06 - reusable product and not really just a
02:08 - proof of concept that is why they did
02:10 - not make a Big Splash in the roadmap and
02:11 - also why the teaser announcement is
02:13 - extremely vague without any clear
02:14 - details they don't want to over promise
02:16 - until they know for certainly exactly
02:18 - what they can deliver although actually
02:19 - they have already shown one AI tool in
02:22 - the last unite they showed a tool that
02:24 - uses Ai and machine learning to easily
02:26 - position and animate some characters as
02:28 - you move a hand the tool uses AI to
02:30 - figure out where the rest of the body
02:31 - should be this really speeds up the
02:33 - opposing process so you don't have to
02:35 - move each bone individually then that
02:37 - same tune can be used for animations so
02:39 - as you add some keyframes it uses AI to
02:41 - figure out the position of every limb at
02:43 - every frame in a natural way and it can
02:45 - also do some post matching where you
02:47 - give it a picture and then it positions
02:48 - the character in that exact same pose
02:50 - this is one of the several demos that we
02:52 - saw in that privatonk with this you can
02:53 - also see how they are researching tons
02:55 - of areas so they're not just making a
02:57 - quick Chachi PT clone or a clone of
02:59 - stable diffusion and it's actually kind
03:01 - of funny to see the difference in the
03:02 - reactions that talk which showcase an
03:04 - actual tool in action is from a very
03:06 - very positive comments whereas the
03:08 - general AI announcement that has no
03:10 - details that one is almost entirely
03:11 - negative honestly I see this as a
03:13 - positive because it tells you that
03:14 - people are upset when there are no
03:15 - details but become much more positive
03:17 - when they actually see how AI might help
03:19 - them for me as someone with no animation
03:21 - skills I can definitely see this tune
03:22 - being very useful also lots of people
03:24 - were either very excited or very angry
03:26 - when kjiro posted about his AI command
03:29 - tool this actually demonstrates the
03:30 - exact same thing that the AI team was
03:32 - talking about like cager himself
03:33 - mentioned in the FAQ this is just a
03:35 - proof of concept This is Not Practical
03:37 - there is a huge difference between a
03:39 - research proof of concept and a proper
03:41 - usable production ready tool so those
03:43 - are the reasons why they quietly made
03:44 - this announcement instead of making a
03:46 - Big Splash in the official roadmap okay
03:48 - so now let's see those three common
03:49 - questions that I saw for example the
03:51 - first question several people posted a
03:53 - comment saying something like oh they're
03:54 - just announcing this because AI is the
03:56 - big hype right now so they're announcing
03:58 - it just for the investors and they're
04:00 - going going to drop it soon that is a
04:02 - very valid concern and it's actually the
04:03 - very first thing that I asked the AI
04:05 - team the answer is no this is not a
04:06 - knee-jerk reaction to Chachi PT or
04:09 - mid-journey or anything like that they
04:10 - pointed out how Unity has been working
04:12 - with AI for many years now their ml
04:15 - agents package has been around for
04:16 - several years and I've even used it
04:18 - myself to build some interesting things
04:19 - alongside the mligence packages project
04:22 - Barracuda this is their lightweight
04:24 - cross-platform inference engine which is
04:26 - what actually runs in neural networks
04:28 - this is extremely important to make sure
04:29 - you can run machine learning on all the
04:31 - platforms that Unity supports again this
04:33 - package has been in custom development
04:35 - since 2018 and beyond that they made a
04:37 - blog post in 2018 covering their guiding
04:39 - principles which I'm going to cover in a
04:40 - bit so with regards to this question is
04:42 - this just the next shiny thing that UNT
04:44 - is chasing just to jump on the AI hype
04:47 - bandwagon in order to police investors
04:48 - the answer to that is no clearly this
04:51 - area of AI and machine learning this is
04:53 - something they have been researching for
04:54 - a long time which showcase just how
04:55 - serious they are about it another
04:57 - question and the issue people have with
04:58 - AI is with regards to app ethics and
05:01 - again for this they already publicly
05:02 - posted their guiding principles all the
05:04 - way back in 2018 their guiding
05:06 - principles are be unbiased be
05:08 - accountable be fair be responsible be
05:12 - honest and be trustworthy these are
05:14 - their guiding principles as established
05:16 - back in 2018 in that private talks the
05:18 - team told me their principles nowadays
05:20 - are still the same as they were before
05:21 - meaning they're focused on making AI the
05:23 - right way they're not trying to
05:25 - eliminate developers or jobs they're not
05:27 - trying to screw anyone by scripping
05:29 - their dad without consent instead
05:30 - they're trying to do it the right way by
05:32 - giving you tools to help you make your
05:33 - games better and faster since AI is
05:36 - moving really quickly they're also
05:37 - paying close attention to the rules and
05:38 - regulations as this space changes
05:40 - another extremely important question is
05:42 - with regards to data sets plenty of
05:44 - people don't like how all of these AI
05:46 - tools just scrape the entire internet
05:47 - without consent chances are if you've
05:49 - ever drawn an image and published it on
05:51 - the internet that it was used to train
05:52 - stable diffusion or perhaps if you've
05:54 - ever posted something on stack Overflow
05:56 - chances are Chachi PT read about it and
05:58 - learned from it this is a a very tricky
06:00 - subject should the AI tools be allowed
06:03 - to learn from any public Source or
06:04 - should they require consent first that's
06:06 - not just a moral issue but in legal one
06:08 - as well is it legal to train a model on
06:11 - copyrighted materials there are already
06:13 - several lawsuits currently ongoing and
06:15 - right now no one knows which way the
06:17 - chords are on the side right now it's
06:18 - certainly complete unknown and if game
06:20 - development is your job you definitely
06:22 - don't want to be dependent on data known
06:24 - and potentially become exposed to legal
06:26 - problems in the future there are already
06:27 - some reports that various Studios have
06:29 - forbidden the use of AI tools simply
06:31 - because it is not clear how it works
06:33 - legally those Studios absolutely do want
06:35 - to use AI to improve their productivity
06:37 - but not at the cost of exposing them to
06:39 - legal action The Entity team said that
06:41 - this is something they take very
06:42 - seriously Unity does not want people
06:45 - that use the engine to be exposed to any
06:47 - kind of legal liability because of
06:48 - copyright questions related to the
06:50 - original data set so that means in order
06:52 - to do it right they need to gather the
06:53 - data sets properly and with consent this
06:55 - is another part of the reason why they
06:57 - didn't announce anything specific
06:58 - because these two homes are built on
07:00 - data massive amounts of data and if
07:02 - you're doing things the right way either
07:03 - you need to get consent or you need to
07:05 - build all that data yourself as you can
07:07 - imagine for something like an AI mocap
07:09 - tool it takes quite a bit of time and
07:10 - money to generate all of the thousands
07:12 - of hours of mocap data that you need in
07:14 - order to make the tune work for me this
07:15 - showcase is just how committed they are
07:17 - to doing Aid right way with consent and
07:19 - without exposing you the developer to
07:21 - any legal liability since Unity is
07:23 - working on building an entire data set
07:24 - that they themselves own they can then
07:26 - build tools and know for certain there
07:28 - are no legal issues as for what are the
07:30 - tones themselves like I said what I saw
07:32 - is under NDA so I can't reveal any
07:34 - specifics on what I saw but they've
07:35 - already probably shown that talk in
07:37 - unite where they showcase AI driven
07:39 - posing AI animation and post-matching
07:41 - from an image another AI tool they've
07:43 - shown many times is called kinematica
07:45 - which is an AI driven animation system
07:47 - now they actually pause development on
07:49 - this dual until that animation is fully
07:51 - stable which might happen sometime later
07:53 - this year so perhaps kinematica won't be
07:55 - back next year beyond that you can look
07:57 - at the General State of AI and assume
07:59 - Unity is researching of those areas like
08:01 - for example kijirusum where a chatbot
08:03 - can interact directly with unity of
08:05 - course using AI to generate all kinds of
08:07 - textures this is something that already
08:09 - exist you don't think stopping them from
08:11 - releasing something like this right now
08:12 - is simply the need for building their
08:13 - own data set from scratch Nvidia has
08:15 - already announced a text to 3D tool that
08:18 - one would definitely be extremely useful
08:19 - to game devs there are already some
08:21 - tunes on the accessor they use AI for
08:23 - terrain generation and placing objects
08:25 - with regards to code Microsoft recently
08:27 - announced GitHub co-pilot X which seems
08:29 - really impressive it allows you to
08:31 - generate documentation ask questions
08:33 - based on your code base write code with
08:34 - voice and so on so you can probably
08:36 - assume Unity is researching all kinds of
08:38 - use case related to AI but at the same
08:40 - time like I mentioned in the beginning
08:41 - there's a huge difference between a
08:43 - proof of concept and a proper usable
08:44 - production ready tool so it remains to
08:46 - be seen how many of these possible use
08:48 - cases they can turn into proper tools oh
08:50 - no I can definitely understand the
08:51 - skepticism and negativity that people
08:53 - had in reaction to this extremely bare
08:55 - bone Caesar I get that but what I saw
08:57 - behind closed doors really puts my mind
08:59 - at these that they are doing this the
09:01 - right way and actively trying to avoid
09:03 - all of the negative pitfalls of AI
09:04 - hopefully in the coming months as the
09:06 - Apparently announced more and more on
09:07 - this topic people will see how AI might
09:09 - help them make better games faster which
09:11 - will then generate a more positive
09:12 - sentiment if you want to learn more you
09:14 - can sign up to their AI beta I've signed
09:17 - up myself and I'm very much looking
09:18 - forward to seeing what the future brings
09:19 - alright hope that's useful check out
09:22 - these videos to learn some more thanks
09:24 - to these awesome patreon supporters for
09:25 - making these videos possible thank you
09:27 - for watching and I'll see you next time
