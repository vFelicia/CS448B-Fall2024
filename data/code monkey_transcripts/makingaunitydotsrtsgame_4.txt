00:02 - [Music]
01:04 - [Music]
01:35 - all right hey everyone how's it going
01:38 - hope you're having a great week so far
01:40 - thanks for joining me on this live
01:41 - stream hey hey thanks so much you in a
01:46 - crossa yeah that that would go very well
01:48 - right now I definitely wish I had had a
01:50 - nice crossa around here would be very
01:52 - nice very welcoming so yeah thanks so
01:54 - much uh all
01:58 - right I think levels are
02:01 - good I don't know let me just TR to
02:03 - increase
02:04 - this the max okay I think it's already
02:08 - near the max hopefully that's okay all
02:15 - right what is the people walking on the
02:17 - bottom yep that is actually a it's a
02:20 - Unity window it's a transparent Unity
02:23 - window uh just just set things up a
02:27 - little bit uh
02:30 - on
02:34 - the oh let me
02:37 - just uh where's my controller like that
02:40 - there you
02:41 - go uh my windows here so if you want to
02:44 - know how this all thing down here works
02:48 - it's it's a transparent TT windows so
02:50 - you can go on this page and I've got
02:51 - tutorials down here basically for how I
02:53 - built all this so the whole thing is a
02:55 - transparent TNT window for the
02:56 - characters the way they are animated
02:58 - those are mesh based animations and how
03:00 - it's interacting with YouTube API
03:01 - through an HTTP request from inside
03:03 - unity and these characters the way they
03:05 - are random is how I implemented them the
03:07 - guest spreadsheets in my game battle
03:08 - round Tycoon so if you're curious as to
03:10 - the technical part of all this uh
03:13 - where's the chat where's the chat
03:14 - there's the chat can watch that watch
03:17 - these tutorials and you'll be able to
03:18 - build something just like
03:21 - that song is a little bit loud is it let
03:23 - me just put it down a little bit because
03:26 - it's a bit uh I think the main thing is
03:28 - my microphone is probably a bit too low
03:30 - cuz I'm the goal here is to do a little
03:33 - bit of programming I can't have the
03:35 - microphone too close to here so it has
03:37 - to be a bit further away so I think that
03:39 - is why
03:40 - the that is why the levels are likeus 20
03:44 - Deb let me just uh can I change that a
03:49 - little bit I go one two
03:54 - here I put the input G like 50 or 60 let
03:58 - me see if that one change
04:00 - uh all right so it seems a little bit
04:03 - higher so hopefully that's a bit better
04:05 - now uh all right okay yeah I hope you're
04:10 - all doing well today on this random what
04:12 - is it Tuesday Wednesday I don't even
04:15 - know what day today is what is it is it
04:19 - okay it's weddingday yeah I'm a bit lost
04:21 - but sure yeah hey Brazil hey how's it
04:23 - going all right okay so yeah basically
04:25 - I've been doing research on my on my
04:28 - little RTS game so I've got a bunch of
04:32 - stuff that I still need to do so I
04:33 - figured might as well do it on live
04:35 - stream answer some questions some things
04:37 - like that so hopefully it should be
04:38 - interesting already got a little bit uh
04:41 - implemented although the main thing is
04:43 - more uh the main tricky part so far on
04:46 - my research is figuring out what parts
04:48 - to do in dots and what parts to not do
04:50 - in dots what parts to do in just regular
04:52 - monob behaviors so that has been
04:54 - definitely an uh an interesting process
04:57 - so far uh basically in the beginning I
04:59 - was making almost all of it inside of
05:01 - dots like for example the unit selection
05:03 - manager so I was handling like selection
05:06 - of the units I was doing this in a
05:07 - regular dot system but now after after
05:11 - trying it out for a while I figured it
05:12 - makes more sense to just have a regular
05:14 - mod Behavior so just some basic code and
05:16 - then this regular amount of behavior
05:18 - that interacts with the en world and
05:20 - does all kinds of things in order to
05:21 - select the select the unit so so yeah
05:23 - basically on my research Pro process it
05:25 - has been sort of like that just about
05:27 - trying all kinds of things and figuring
05:29 - out
05:30 - what works well as part dots and what
05:32 - works well as just a normal mon Behavior
05:35 - game
05:36 - object is this a network game or using
05:38 - netcut for Dots nope this is going to be
05:40 - just a a single player game I mean I
05:43 - might do then a followup on on
05:45 - multiplayer but uh so far the goal for
05:47 - this one is just a standard single
05:49 - player game using using uh dots
05:53 - basically I've wanted to research how to
05:54 - make a complete Game using dots for
05:56 - quite a long time and now that finally
05:58 - Unity 6 is here and is definitely fully
06:01 - stable to be used I think now is the
06:02 - perfect time to actually try to try to
06:05 - do that hey so thanks again for you and
06:08 - another Super Chat hey King spray thanks
06:10 - for all the great work you do for you to
06:12 - come in Ah that's awesome hey thank you
06:13 - all so much for being here and watching
06:15 - the videos following the channel I
06:16 - really hope all the videos have helped
06:18 - you out a lot on your own Learning
06:19 - Journey I mean the goal is I make the
06:22 - videos sharing what I know so that you
06:23 - can learn things too so that you can
06:25 - then apply all those learnings to do all
06:27 - kinds of interesting game design ideas
06:29 - you have in your mind so that's kind of
06:31 - that's kind of my goal with this channel
06:32 - So yeah thank you all so much for
06:33 - watching and I hope it has been quite
06:35 - useful to all of
06:39 - you stuck on 2D farming can you please
06:42 - just not spam just ask question once and
06:44 - I'll try to
06:46 - help I have no idea what you mean by 2D
06:48 - farming system there's like a million
06:51 - ways to do that so my advice to you when
06:53 - trying to fix any kind of problem the
06:55 - first thing is figuring out how to break
06:57 - that problem apart into multiple pieces
06:59 - and try to solve the each of those
07:01 - problems one by one CU if you try to
07:03 - solve them all all at once it is
07:04 - probably going to be very mess so the
07:06 - first thing I would do split that figure
07:08 - out what exactly you're stuck with in
07:11 - that farming system that great system
07:13 - and then try to yep there's a million
07:15 - ways to solve pretty much anything so
07:17 - yeah how didn't make the Game Dev news
07:19 - episode I sat down on a chair with a
07:21 - green screen behind me I read the script
07:23 - using a talent perameter read it onto a
07:25 - camera and then did a bunch of editing
07:27 - so the answer to how it's actually
07:28 - relatively simple simple but it takes
07:30 - quite a lot of work that is actually in
07:31 - terms of editing that is actually a very
07:34 - uh a very tricky video format to do so
07:38 - okay so let me do just a little bit of
07:39 - work and then I'll answer some more
07:40 - questions so the one thing that I want
07:42 - to do was I want to convert this unit
07:44 - visual system into something that is uh
07:47 - not ECS based so something that is just
07:49 - a regular uh game object so let me do
07:52 - that so instead of having my unit visual
07:54 - system let's create a regular amount of
07:56 - behavior for the unit visual manager
08:01 - so let's try doing this actually the
08:03 - characters down here kind of kind of
08:05 - screws up my UI just in case you don't
08:07 - know I'm actually seeing all these
08:08 - characters these are actually on the
08:09 - bottom of my screen it's not just an
08:10 - overlay so yeah sometimes makes it a
08:13 - little bit uh tricky in order to uh in
08:16 - order to be able to see things down here
08:19 - guess Portugal accent yep I am uh I am
08:22 - from Portugal I am in Portugal so yep
08:23 - that is why my accent is probably a
08:26 - little bit
08:27 - strange uh okay so let me do the unit
08:30 - visual manager so for this one I
08:32 - actually don't think I need any
08:33 - references to anything so let me just
08:36 - add that one set that one and so what do
08:40 - I have to do on this
08:41 - one so I'm basally going to do the exact
08:44 - same thing as on this one so I'm going
08:45 - to have to listen to the other one so
08:47 - let's do a start go to the unit
08:49 - selection manager on the instance and I
08:52 - got to listen to when those change so
08:54 - the unit selection
08:57 - manager so when the units change yeah
08:59 - pretty much just got to run the exact
09:01 - same code so actually converting this
09:03 - one from dots into non dos should be
09:05 - very simple it should be literally just
09:08 - like this yeah so actually this one is
09:11 - pretty
09:12 - simple let's just see if this works
09:15 - where's my pen my pen is
09:18 - gone where' my pen
09:21 - go did I lose my pen oh
09:27 - crap oh there it is
09:31 - all
09:34 - right later kitchen chaos course
09:36 - yesterday oh that's awesome hey congrats
09:38 - on reaching the end I hope you I hope
09:40 - you learned a lot by doing that so yeah
09:42 - that was a that was a fun one to make so
09:45 - I hope you'll learn a lot okay so let's
09:46 - see so yep I can select just these just
09:48 - this one and the selection logic works
09:50 - and again the the selection itself is
09:53 - actually in uh these are entities but
09:57 - the manager system that one is a mon
09:59 - Behavior so that is kind of how I'm
10:01 - managing things but if I select all of
10:03 - these These are entities these are all
10:04 - inside an entity subscene and inside
10:07 - they were built with regular game
10:09 - objects regular things and yeah actually
10:12 - working with the the uh mixed uh hybrid
10:16 - mode is actually coming along quite nice
10:19 - what say that choose dots versus Mon
10:21 - behavior that is something that I'm
10:22 - learning by myself as I'm doing research
10:24 - for this course but the conclusion that
10:27 - I'm coming to is basically if it is
10:29 - something something that involves lots
10:30 - of units lots of lots of iteration if
10:33 - it's something that is going to run
10:34 - constantly like for example the code for
10:36 - moving the units that that makes sense
10:38 - to be dots code but if it is something
10:40 - that happens just once like for example
10:41 - the management for selecting the units
10:43 - for handling which units are select
10:45 - which ones aren't so the code that
10:46 - manages all this logic that one makes
10:48 - more sense to be just a regular mono
10:50 - Behavior so that is kind of the logic
10:52 - that that I'm going for for things that
10:54 - imple for things that work Logic on
10:57 - multiple units multiple elements for
10:59 - that do it in dots for things that exist
11:01 - pretty much just one for all kinds of
11:02 - manager systems and so on just make it
11:04 - regular am Behavior so that's kind of
11:07 - the rough idea that I'm going for but
11:09 - like I said this is research so I don't
11:11 - know if I'm going to come up with uh a
11:14 - different perspective in the future but
11:16 - so far that is what is making quite a
11:17 - bit of sense so all right so so these
11:20 - are indeed working now I very much want
11:22 - to I want to be able to click to select
11:25 - the unit because I actually still got a
11:27 - slight issue right here because if I
11:31 - right now if I click it works but it
11:34 - only works if I click on the bottom
11:35 - because it's all based on doing a
11:37 - physics quering so if you're curious as
11:39 - to how the unit selection Works here's
11:41 - my unit selection manager again just a
11:43 - regular amount of behavior and from this
11:44 - one I am interacting with the physics
11:46 - with the with the en's world so I'm
11:48 - basically just going to the world in
11:50 - order to grab the enti manager then from
11:52 - there I construct an NT query in order
11:54 - to find all the units with Target
11:56 - position unit and the selected and then
11:58 - I B basically just grab all of those in
12:00 - order to give them the target position
12:02 - and then for actually selecting them so
12:04 - that's that's for the movement so
12:05 - basically when I right click it tells
12:07 - them where to go and then for the uh
12:09 - movement I basically uh get a click for
12:12 - position a release worm position in
12:13 - order to calculate the square that
12:15 - defines what area I want to select and
12:18 - then for actually selecting things I'm
12:19 - doing some dots physics so basically
12:21 - going inside the anti manager get get
12:23 - the physics World Singleton then from
12:25 - that one grab the Collision world uh
12:27 - construct an array construct a fil for
12:29 - the things and then just do a simple
12:30 - overlap box so the one thing is that
12:33 - when dots things are indeed quite a bit
12:35 - more
12:36 - complex uh because so in physic in
12:40 - normal uh thing you just do just go
12:43 - inside physics and do overlap box just
12:45 - like this and it works whereas in ECS
12:48 - World in dots World you've got to First
12:50 - grab the physics World signon in order
12:51 - to grab the Collision world you have to
12:53 - prepare some native lists you have to
12:54 - prepare the Collision filter in order to
12:56 - finally do the overlap box so in terms
12:58 - of dots it does still have quite a quite
13:01 - a bit more more setup quite a bit more
13:03 - things that need to be done so it's not
13:05 - quite as simple but in the end it does
13:08 - work quite well so it leads so it
13:10 - requires quite a bit more code but in
13:11 - terms of logic it is also uh relatively
13:13 - straightforward so hopefully this should
13:16 - be hopefully uh uh the video that I will
13:19 - eventually make will hopefully be very
13:21 - good for learning since I'm basically
13:23 - going through all the all the trouble of
13:25 - doing all research figuring out it took
13:26 - me quite a while to figure out how to do
13:28 - how to do cast overlap box and all this
13:30 - so hopefully on the final video you can
13:32 - basically skip ahead all of the uh
13:34 - frustration that I had in figuring out a
13:36 - bunch of these things so hopefully the
13:37 - final video won't be really nice okay so
13:40 - let's let this out and thanks again King
13:43 - spray for the Super Chat and Sh again
13:45 - coffee overd those that would be nice
13:47 - overd those is not nice ea uh drinking a
13:50 - little bit for fun that sounds good but
13:52 - yeah all within moderation okay so let's
13:54 - see so I dis select all units and now
13:56 - it's over here that I wanted to do a so
13:58 - I was actually researching for it so
14:00 - basically going here on the
14:02 - documentation which by the way uh a
14:03 - bunch of you have asked me on comments
14:05 - in my videos about how do I research
14:08 - things when there are no video tutorials
14:10 - and well this is the answer I visually
14:11 - go onto the official docs official
14:13 - manuals I try to read a bunch of things
14:16 - I try to read all the code examples and
14:18 - eventually I write a bunch of Code test
14:20 - out see what works what doesn't work and
14:22 - then everything works like that so but
14:25 - anyways I actually don't think that I
14:26 - need to do anything different cuz I
14:29 - think I just go inside the Collision
14:31 - world except instead of doing an overlap
14:33 - box I just do a cast Ray yep now this
14:37 - one takes a rcast input now what is a
14:39 - rast
14:40 - input uh apparently takes a start and
14:43 - end and then has a filter so let me do
14:45 - the rcast input for the rcast input let
14:48 - me do a brand new rcast input and now
14:51 - inside so I've got start that is going
14:53 - to be the start
14:56 - position uh is that no it's not
15:02 - okay a crap so now that's actually
15:05 - annoying because I I wasn't quite
15:06 - thinking about ah I got to remember H
15:08 - how that thing works camera. Main in
15:12 - order to get the uh the screen Point
15:16 - array I think that's it I never like
15:17 - using these these uh raycast things in
15:20 - order to calculate the Ray and I but I
15:22 - think like that I should be able to then
15:24 - do
15:25 - it what's difficulty curve using dots
15:27 - well I'm basically going through myself
15:29 - and some things are relatively
15:31 - straightforward if you want to do
15:32 - something basic it is actually super
15:34 - simple but if you want to do things that
15:36 - are more complex then yeah like in this
15:38 - example here doing a physics query in
15:40 - dots is quite a bit more complex than
15:42 - doing uh physics query in non dots so
15:44 - yeah there definitely takes quite a bit
15:48 - uh quite a bit of learning how things
15:50 - are done differently but once you figure
15:52 - out how things are done differently then
15:53 - they are not is there a name Collision
15:55 - there is so this inside Unity engine.
15:58 - Ray and I assume from this R can I get
16:00 - the start position no I
16:10 - can't oh I can get the point okay cuz
16:13 - I'm trying to figure out how do I get
16:14 - the the start point for this one I think
16:17 - like this it might work so basically
16:19 - this is going to get me the point so I
16:22 - think like this it might work and then
16:25 - the end point well I guess
16:29 - I guess what is the end point let me see
16:31 - X over here it says the aray from the
16:33 - aray to and so on hey a new new member
16:36 - hey thanks so much Tessy hey and by the
16:39 - way for all of you who are uh channel
16:40 - members or patreon supporters uh check
16:42 - the uh the videos or the messages on the
16:46 - members tab so you can get access to the
16:48 - private Discord and the private live
16:50 - streams that I do every Saturday so just
16:52 - in case you want to join those go ahead
16:54 - so uh okay so basically over here so for
16:57 - the start Point let me start
16:59 - for the end point well I guess maybe if
17:00 - I get end with some huge number maybe
17:03 - that will work and then it's got the
17:05 - filter so that is going to be the
17:07 - Collision
17:09 - filter okay so let's see if like this
17:11 - this rcast input does work and then this
17:14 - going to output something but for now
17:16 - let me just do a debug. log on this guy
17:18 - right here so let's see if this one
17:20 - has should have to transformation
17:23 - helpers uh yeah cuz the main thing is
17:25 - converting the what is the start point
17:27 - with the ray does ray. origin
17:30 - exist Ray dot oh it does all right thank
17:35 - you okay so that's good so that one
17:37 - actually probably makes more sense to
17:39 - have the ray. origin RTS like mobile
17:42 - Legends I don't know mobile Legends uh
17:44 - it's like um uh games like Age of
17:47 - Empires Command and Conquer Red Alert
17:50 - Starcraft uh those kinds of things so
17:53 - Company of Heroes yeah uh okay so
17:56 - basically is giving me false
17:59 - oh cuz that one oh right I I was I was
18:02 - thinking it was going to hit this one
18:03 - but this plane this is just a regular
18:05 - game object meaning this guy does not
18:07 - exist in the actual uh in the actual
18:09 - dots physics world so that makes sense
18:11 - that's why clicking over here is
18:12 - returning false but now if I click on
18:14 - top one of these units yep now that one
18:16 - does return to all right awesome so let
18:18 - me just actually edit cuz I'm pretty
18:20 - sure the collider isn't
18:24 - perfect when using camera main is still
18:26 - find the camera at run time can you
18:27 - elaborate on this time that was the
18:29 - previous thing previously when you used
18:31 - uh camera. main you were you were
18:34 - supposed to cash this one because every
18:36 - time he did this he was constantly doing
18:38 - a fine so doing this one on every single
18:39 - update it was a terrial thing but I
18:42 - don't know like two or three Unity
18:43 - versions ago they automatically handle
18:45 - the caching on the back end so nowadays
18:47 - you don't necessarily need to cash it
18:49 - you you can do it if you want to but
18:51 - yeah there's no no performance benefit
18:53 - so even if you are on some kind of
18:54 - update you can use camera. Main in the
18:56 - background it won be cach so it is no
18:58 - longer going to be a massive a massive
19:01 - performance uh drop like it was uh back
19:03 - in the day cuz yeah quite a while ago
19:06 - quite a few versions ago that was indeed
19:07 - one of the main ways that a lot of
19:09 - people had a lot of issues why can't I
19:11 - see the button authoring uh cuz a lot of
19:13 - people had a lot of issues with terrible
19:16 - performance indeed because of that
19:18 - because the camera. main was so insanely
19:20 - slow but thankfully now Unity cash isn't
19:23 - in the background so nowadays you don't
19:25 - have those issues okay so let's go so
19:28 - now that one is quite a bit better so
19:30 - now I should be able to click on it and
19:31 - see
19:32 - that hey Timo Jones how's it going hey
19:36 - and by the way for all of you if you're
19:38 - seeing all the nice custom characters
19:39 - you can also customize your characters
19:41 - so on the same place where I uh talked a
19:44 - while ago about all these tutorial links
19:46 - you can go there and follow the follow
19:49 - the guide or follow the video tutorial I
19:50 - guess you can just ah you can just watch
19:54 - your video tutorial if you want to
19:55 - customize your own character with either
19:57 - just modified or use a custom spring
19:59 - sheeet like that little nice ringman and
20:01 - this little nice guy over here so that
20:03 - should be fun okay uh right so over here
20:07 - I think it is working so I click on
20:08 - emptiness it's got false and I click on
20:10 - top of the unit and I got true let me
20:12 - just make sure that I am that I am uh
20:15 - getting it correctly okay so this one
20:17 - casts the Ray and this one just returns
20:20 - if the ray actually hits
20:22 - something hey thanks so much I'm glad my
20:25 - I'm glad my videos have helped you yeah
20:26 - I hope you're all also having a great
20:29 - day okay so this one is just yeah let me
20:31 - use one of the other versions cuz I want
20:32 - to be able to do something uh do I just
20:35 - want the closest hit I guess so yeah I
20:38 - guess I don't want to get all of them
20:40 - just one of them would work fine so let
20:42 - me get out what is this rast hit but
20:45 - it's a rast hit from unity.
20:48 - physics for the closest hit closest rast
20:51 - hit okay so on this one does this one
20:53 - have an entity it does so let me do a
20:55 - debug down log in order to verify this
20:57 - entity just to verify that it is the one
20:59 - indeed that I hit let's try and let's
21:01 - see thanks for on the help yeah awesome
21:04 - of
21:05 - course um have a question about managers
21:09 - within Unity usually you want to access
21:11 - Managers from multiple scripts you
21:12 - recommend making a static instance of
21:14 - these manager for example the game
21:15 - manager yep when you have things I mean
21:17 - that's the that's the whole question
21:19 - about using the Singleton pattern which
21:22 - some people have a really biger version
21:24 - to whereas for me I've always seen it
21:25 - it's just a tool sometimes it's a great
21:27 - tool sometimes it's a bad two but at the
21:29 - end of the day it's really just two so
21:30 - if you have something of which you have
21:32 - just a single thing like for example
21:33 - over here for all these systems these
21:35 - have just one so yep I've got a
21:37 - Singleton right here I've got a
21:38 - Singleton instance because there's only
21:39 - ever a single unit selection manager
21:41 - there only one exists so for me that
21:43 - always makes perfect then so single tens
21:46 - can be abused if you make a ton of them
21:48 - and you have tons of connections between
21:49 - all of your scripts and all of them get
21:50 - all messy get all messed up that is not
21:53 - going to be a good thing so definitely
21:54 - avoid abusing singl ton but definitely
21:56 - make sure you do use them because win
21:58 - these correctly they are extremely good
22:00 - so definitely don't avoid use them just
22:02 - because they can be they can uh lead to
22:05 - tons of issues do use them use them
22:06 - correctly and hopefully it helps more
22:09 - than it hurts uh okay so let me see so
22:12 - if I click on this guy right here what
22:13 - is this one uh oh cuz it's behind the
22:16 - let me click on this one and it's
22:18 - telling me that this guy's unit 169 is
22:22 - that correct let me see uh put it on
22:25 - runtime and yep that one is indeed 169
22:28 - okay great great all right so that is
22:30 - working that is
22:33 - [Music]
22:36 - cool we charge my credit card from
22:38 - Google couldn't trace it back oh
22:41 - really that's interesting I wonder how
22:43 - it how it uh what kind of name does
22:47 - Google use but yeah uh all right so yeah
22:50 - that one is working so now let me just
22:51 - use this logic in order to actually
22:54 - select just a single unit and let me
22:57 - also out that one
23:00 - he Super Chat hey uh thank you so much a
23:03 - heck should I study tomorrow's my class
23:04 - 10 exam yeah definitely go study
23:07 - definitely uh exams are definitely much
23:09 - more important than watching some live
23:11 - streams so yeah I would say watch a
23:13 - little bit and then go study uh cuz
23:15 - studying is definitely definitely very
23:17 - important definitely make sure you pay
23:19 - attention to your own education so you
23:20 - can learn a lot so you can get a ton of
23:23 - knowledge to build tons of things so
23:24 - obviously as you might guess I'm a big
23:26 - fan of education so definitely make sure
23:29 - you do study okay so let me see because
23:30 - I want to make sure that I only select a
23:32 - single unit if basically the player is
23:34 - not doing a square if the player is
23:36 - doing a square I want to select all
23:37 - units within that square but if they
23:38 - only click once then I basically just
23:40 - want to do rast so the logic for doing
23:43 - either rast or not so I do the select I
23:45 - do things but order to do
23:47 - this so B select single unit and
23:52 - basically the way that I'm going to
23:53 - Define that is if the distance so uh
23:56 - Vector 3 mes drag uh Mouse drag distance
24:02 - it's not really distance Mouse drag
24:04 - Vector that makes more
24:06 - sense uh let me take
24:10 - the oh actually no yeah because I've
24:12 - already got the half extend so I can
24:14 - probably use that so have extends that
24:18 - magnitude
24:20 - uh so if this one is above I don't know
24:24 - like uh so select single unit if this
24:26 - one is less than say one unit so if my
24:29 - selection square is less than one unit
24:30 - then basically just going to Ray cast
24:32 - just select one and if not then do that
24:35 - so now if select a single unit if so
24:38 - then I'm going to do the recast logic
24:40 - and if not then I'm going to select
24:42 - multiple units and either way need to do
24:45 - that so up here select multiple
24:49 - units
24:50 - okay so hopefully that should work so
24:53 - basally that does that selects that one
24:54 - and now I really just need to check the
24:57 - unit if that one has a
25:00 - a if it has a unit component if so then
25:04 - select it if not then don't select all
25:06 - right so that should be about it that
25:08 - should be
25:11 - working live to say that I'm from
25:14 - Portugal and I'm loving your cont oh
25:15 - nice just start learning games oh that's
25:17 - awesome hey I'm glad I'm glad the videos
25:19 - have helped you yeah definitely best of
25:21 - luck with your Learning
25:23 - Journey uh okay so let me see if this is
25:25 - working so click on that one okay no why
25:30 - why did you not work it's only it's
25:35 - still okay let me do log on that one
25:39 - some select unit cuz that
25:42 - one I think that makes
25:45 - sense do this guy right here and then
25:48 - this guy right here just print out this
25:51 - to see what it is
25:53 - doing someone trying to inject some
25:55 - JavaScript yeah that is not going to
25:57 - work uh although there was an exploit uh
26:01 - it was able to uh place things with
26:04 - different kinds of uh if you watch my
26:08 - first live stream which I believe the
26:09 - video is still live and uh I believe you
26:13 - can still find it basically a bunch of
26:14 - people were putting uh size tags
26:16 - directly inside their message which then
26:18 - over here since this is using text mes
26:19 - Pro he was using that in order to make
26:22 - in order to make the text on on thing
26:24 - super huge so yeah back on the first
26:26 - live stream it quickly it Qui
26:28 - uh went into chaos with people making
26:30 - tons of messages super huge so I
26:32 - couldn't see anything on screen there
26:33 - were just giant messages with a font of
26:35 - like 500 so yeah that was a a fun
26:38 - exploit that people found right away so
26:40 - that was that was quite interesting okay
26:44 - why is this one always one is that one
26:47 - normalized oh never mind no it's not
26:49 - normalized but I think it has a y of one
26:52 - so that is probably why so let me try
26:55 - well let me actually just try to come up
26:58 - what can I so if I just click it's going
27:01 - to be just one and if I click and
27:04 - drag actually it doesn't I thought it
27:07 - would right cuz cuz the Y is actually
27:09 - messing up
27:12 - so uh so uh let me get the vector three
27:17 - for the drag Vector so that is going to
27:20 - be the half extent but then I take that
27:23 - guy I set the Y into zerf and that way
27:25 - it should work a little bit better so
27:27 - now if if I print out magnitude on this
27:29 - one now it should make more sense hey L
27:31 - man hey how's it going how are the the
27:34 - issues with the uh making networked
27:38 - fireworks I know you I've seen a bunch
27:41 - of those uh videos on on Twitter hope
27:44 - it's going well cuz yeah handling
27:46 - fireworks in multiplayer all those
27:48 - particles all those things that
27:49 - definitely sounds quite challenging um
27:52 - and yeah there you go the logic is
27:53 - working so I can click individually on
27:55 - each unit select move them around or I
27:57 - can select all of them
27:58 - I just need to make sure to let go like
28:00 - that and yep that does
28:02 - work solve the NGO update well ah
28:06 - nice yeah I mean I've seen there where
28:08 - I've actually want to uh go and do some
28:11 - research on the latest net code packages
28:13 - I've read the change log and does seem
28:15 - uh there are some interesting things
28:17 - like merging the various rpcs so yeah
28:19 - definitely would like to have some time
28:21 - to go and uh research those those new uh
28:26 - new changes that should be interesting
28:28 - [Music]
28:32 - you run into performance straps working
28:34 - with dots I've had issues with unit
28:36 - finding targets using overlap spheres
28:38 - and checking team tags uh not yet but
28:40 - I've only done uh a little bit of
28:42 - research so I haven't done anything
28:43 - extreme so I'm curious to see that
28:46 - issues with finding targets using
28:47 - overlap spheres okay I'm curious to see
28:50 - what those what those uh issues were CU
28:53 - yeah that is also definitely what I'm
28:54 - planning to do for for doing defining
28:56 - targets logic I'm going to do the the
28:58 - same thing doing an overlap sphere and
29:01 - trying to find it so yeah I guess if
29:02 - there are issues with that then I will
29:05 - TR doing that the particles Network wise
29:08 - Sol the smart wave with a SE that is
29:09 - shared oh nice that that is smart that
29:12 - is definitely smart sh the share the
29:14 - seed and everyone
29:16 - everyone uh share the seed and everyone
29:20 - runs the same local simulation logic
29:23 - that is definitely definitely very wise
29:25 - very
29:26 - smart my game trct players money by
29:29 - using a script M object the script
29:31 - object is reset the start and is used to
29:32 - read multiple scripts should I make this
29:34 - a Singleton
29:36 - instead uh do you mean you're using a
29:39 - script object for read and write
29:42 - personally that is something that I
29:43 - advise against just because it has a
29:45 - bunch of issues that you might not know
29:48 - about so I made a video on that on why
29:51 - you should be careful with script ball
29:54 - objects and basically the thing is how
29:56 - in the editor they work one way they
29:58 - work as persistent data but if you then
29:59 - make a Bild they do not work as
30:01 - persistent data so if you're using
30:02 - script objects for read and write access
30:04 - if so definitely be aware of this
30:06 - limitation and the same time a bunch of
30:08 - people in the comments in those videos
30:09 - uh mention some interesting points so I
30:12 - made the followup so definitely do watch
30:13 - these two videos if you're doing that
30:15 - personally I do not I do not uh like
30:18 - using scripal objects for read and write
30:19 - access I normally just use them as read
30:21 - only things so yeah personally I would
30:25 - not use them for read right but
30:26 - technically you can do and if you using
30:28 - it for read write and yeah maybe using a
30:30 - regular Singleton manager maybe that
30:31 - might make quite a bit more
30:33 - sense okay so let me let me try doing uh
30:36 - something a little bit okay so basally
30:37 - like this I've got that one and now what
30:40 - I want to do is I want to be able when I
30:42 - right click I want to be able okay so
30:43 - this one just tells me the movement now
30:45 - i' be able to see that I right click on
30:47 - top of an enemy so for that I'm going to
30:49 - have to use pretty much all of the same
30:51 - logic obviously in the future I'm going
30:53 - to refactor all this code so just
30:55 - something to keep in mind as you're
30:57 - watching me work live
30:58 - keep in mind this is how I write the
31:01 - code uh piece by piece but obviously
31:04 - what am I missing the uh not the right
31:08 - wait do I need the right no I do need
31:10 - the right uh right
31:15 - yeah okay so basically now I want to
31:17 - figure out if I hit an enemy did I
31:19 - already tag that enemy I don't know that
31:21 - I did then yeah thanks so much for
31:23 - becoming a channel member okay so let me
31:25 - put son authoring the enemy authoring
31:27 - script okay I already have an enemy
31:28 - component so over here is an enemy and
31:32 - this guy is going to have the component
31:34 - for the enemy okay so this one is if I
31:37 - right click on enemy so debug. log
31:40 - attacking
31:41 - enemy so let's see that so if I right
31:43 - click on top of an enemy it should
31:45 - actually say that I'm right clicking on
31:47 - top of an enemy off to work now it's G
31:49 - to have time for me yeah definitely see
31:50 - you have a great great time working on
31:53 - the game best of luck uh RTS course live
31:57 - w't that be record yeah there won't be
31:59 - recorded videos I mean this I'm
32:00 - basically just doing research and I
32:02 - figured might as well build the
32:04 - prototype for research over here on live
32:06 - stream instead of thing but yeah the the
32:08 - uh video lectures will be standard
32:10 - normal video lectures and so on does RTS
32:13 - stand for it stands for realtime
32:15 - strategy so games like command conquer
32:18 - Age of Empires and so on so all those
32:20 - kinds of games okay uh so yep this one
32:23 - is indeed working and now here comes the
32:25 - interesting bit because I want to be
32:26 - able to tell the selected units where to
32:30 - attack
32:33 - so
32:38 - um uh do I put this inside a trying to
32:42 - figure out uh ball is attacking
32:46 - enemy probably makes more sense to
32:48 - separate this but I'll I'll sort this
32:50 - out not let stor gate isn't that the one
32:52 - from the dev like Starcraft we're
32:54 - working on that looked interesting so
32:58 - I have no idea what happened to that one
32:59 - it's been it's been a while wasn't that
33:01 - one like summer game Fest of last year I
33:03 - haven't seen it in a while okay so let
33:06 - me need this guy right here so if you
33:08 - are not attacking enemy oh
33:11 - crap so if not attacking the enemy if
33:15 - not then I move if I am attacking the
33:17 - enemy then I don't do
33:19 - that you find dots in terms of learning
33:22 - card uh so far it's pretty interesting I
33:24 - mean definitely got to do a lot of
33:26 - Googling reading the manual and so on so
33:30 - uh definitely has a learning curve but
33:33 - honestly just learning the things and
33:35 - yeah there you go this does work say for
33:37 - examp learning how to do ray cast
33:39 - physics cast box cast learning how to do
33:41 - all these physics queries that take
33:43 - quite a bit of researching reading all
33:44 - documentation all the things but yeah
33:46 - after a while I managed to get this
33:48 - super basic scene in just a handful of
33:49 - hours so yeah there is a learning curve
33:52 - but it
33:53 - does uh it does actually work pretty
33:56 - well decently
34:01 - why do the entities shake a bit when
34:03 - they're idle that is simply because they
34:05 - they have a Target and they're
34:06 - constantly going to that Target I didn't
34:07 - Implement any kind of uh stopping logic
34:10 - so basically they keep moving to the
34:11 - Target they get there and they
34:12 - constantly jump forward back and forth
34:14 - between the targets so that is why they
34:16 - are shaking because they because they
34:18 - get there then they jump over to the
34:19 - other side and move back and so on so on
34:21 - so on so yeah that is that is basically
34:25 - why uh okay so basically I can click on
34:27 - attacking the enemy and now the question
34:29 - is how do I set the enemy Target so now
34:31 - this is the kind of thing that during
34:32 - research requires quite a bit of quite a
34:35 - bit of thinking in terms of figuring out
34:37 - okay how do I organize this in terms of
34:40 - data debug L to print yeah yeah that's
34:44 - uh that's an interesting one for me I'm
34:45 - so used to writing debug.log that I just
34:48 - write that constantly without even
34:49 - thinking about it uh okay so let me
34:51 - think how do I make a targeting system
34:53 - for this actually I had the target
34:56 - position
34:58 - uh what do I call it I don't know uh
35:01 - maybe a just do enemy Target no Target
35:07 - enemy I think makes more sense
35:09 - authoring so I make this authoring
35:12 - component now on this one uh basically
35:14 - I'm going to have a public stroke for
35:16 - the Target enemy and this one is going
35:19 - to be I component
35:21 - data so this the target enemy and inside
35:24 - I want to have an entity or an enemy I
35:27 - think an entity so Target
35:30 - entity so I guess doesn't necessarily
35:32 - need to be a Target enemy so putting a
35:36 - baker class Baker Target and
35:39 - authoring and just like this Implement
35:42 - that one so basically over here entity
35:45 - entity equals get the entity and get the
35:48 - entity uh this one is going to need to
35:51 - move so Dynamic and then just add the
35:54 - component on this en new Target enemy
35:57 - just like this put it nice and empty cuz
36:00 - there is an empty entity right let me
36:03 - let me see
36:05 - uh wasn't there I thought there
36:08 - was okay I think that's it I can compare
36:11 - with the null entity in order to see if
36:13 - this one has has something or not okay
36:16 - so let's see so basically with this I
36:18 - can set the target enemy so then over
36:20 - here on the unit selection on this one
36:22 - when I right click on top of attacking
36:23 - an enemy I can basically go through
36:28 - I think it's this array yeah exactly
36:30 - it's through this array so I go through
36:32 - this array of units that are selected I
36:34 - don't even need the target position I go
36:36 - through these and then I set the new
36:39 - what do I call it Target Enemy new
36:42 - Target enemy and inside for the Target
36:44 - entity it is going to be the uh in put
36:47 - entity for Target enemy entity it's
36:50 - going to be the closest break asset.
36:52 - entity so I've got this one and I'm
36:55 - going to set this one like this
36:59 - all right so let's see if this does work
37:02 - so basically I attach the authoring I
37:04 - make this one and that one should be
37:06 - able and I should be able to right click
37:07 - and all the selected entities should
37:09 - then get the target
37:11 - entity for. score so far I've taken all
37:14 - your courses they are amazing and taught
37:15 - me a ton of stuff which I use every day
37:17 - oh that's awesome that is really cool
37:18 - that is exactly why I make them so I'm
37:20 - glad you have learned quite a lot so
37:22 - yeah thanks so much
37:28 - what was your percentage in class
37:31 - 10 I have uh what is Class 10 is that is
37:35 - that a universal thing I actually don't
37:37 - know I don't know what you mean by
37:39 - percentage uh do you mean like school
37:42 - scores that was let me just add the uh
37:46 - terms of school I was sort of all right
37:49 - I guess depends on the on the topics
37:51 - like in math I was pretty decent in the
37:53 - program class that I had those were
37:56 - obviously excellent so the uh School
37:59 - scoring over here in Portugal goes from
38:00 - 0 to 20 at least in high school so for
38:03 - the programming I had I think it was
38:05 - three programming uh uh different uh
38:09 - studies things and all of those I would
38:11 - always get 20 cuz I I've been
38:13 - programming for a long time so those
38:15 - always got the max score when it was
38:17 - like math I would get like 16 17 and
38:20 - then things like philosophy and
38:22 - Portuguese I would get like 10 so yeah
38:25 - it really depends on the on the topic
38:27 - but yeah varied quite a bit uh okay let
38:31 - me just attach so I want to attach the
38:34 - target enemy
38:36 - authoring hey yeah thanks for being here
38:38 - I hope you've learned a ton uh for
38:40 - Target enemy authoring let me see if
38:41 - like this if I can select some units
38:43 - then set them and if they go over there
38:45 - so let me put this one into
38:47 - runtime and let me see if I can find
38:50 - that one so they target enemy okay that
38:51 - one says no let me just pick one of
38:53 - these let me just separate this guy out
38:55 - so I can click on it and SL selected and
38:58 - this one target enemy okay Target enemy
39:01 - still nothing and now if I right click
39:04 - now I'm still moving that one is still
39:05 - empty and if I right click on that one
39:07 - and there you go it does work it does
39:08 - select the enemy unit and if I select
39:10 - either of these these do not have an
39:12 - enemy selected and nope I have to select
39:15 - them all and if I select just a handful
39:18 - of them let's say select just this one
39:21 - and attack that one and now that one
39:23 - should have an enemy so if I select that
39:24 - one go into that one and see any of that
39:27 - one do have an enemy okay awesome so I
39:29 - can click and select an enemy okay so
39:32 - now I want to spawn some
39:34 - bullets playing for a while and just
39:36 - found out that you're Portuguese yep
39:38 - that is
39:38 - true yeah it's a it's a because it's an
39:41 - English Channel channel that is always
39:43 - an an interesting news for for some
39:47 - people it's always it's always
39:48 - fun
39:50 - [Music]
39:51 - um someone asking are you going to go
39:54 - over animations as well that is a very
39:56 - good question I'm not sure what I'm
39:58 - going to do about that topic uh because
40:00 - yeah animations uh Unity ECS right now
40:03 - does not support animations by default
40:06 - so there are a bunch of assets on the
40:07 - store that uh do handle animations and
40:10 - if I was making a commercial game using
40:12 - dots I would definitely be using that
40:13 - but of course if I'm making uh something
40:16 - that is part of the course I don't want
40:17 - the course to be dependent on on buying
40:19 - a third party asset so I'm still not
40:21 - sure what I'm going to do either I
40:23 - Implement some kind of Animation system
40:25 - from scratch within but I don't know
40:27 - depends on how complex that is it
40:29 - definitely wouldn't make much sense to
40:30 - have a course where half the course is
40:31 - like building a custom animation system
40:33 - that would be a bit strange hey ruin hey
40:36 - how's it going um so yeah that would be
40:39 - a bit tricky but if it is simple I might
40:41 - do it on the course or if not I might
40:43 - just see super basic animations like
40:46 - instead of having like humanoid skin
40:48 - mesh renders animations all those kind
40:49 - of things maybe just uh fix animation
40:52 - poses some basic uh just rotation kind
40:54 - of things so yeah I'm still not not
40:56 - entirely
40:58 - sure what option I'm going to go with
40:59 - that is why that is why basically I'm
41:01 - making this prototype in order to do a
41:02 - bunch of research because yeah it's
41:04 - going to
41:05 - be that is an interesting question
41:07 - because yeah in terms of dots animation
41:09 - not having it by default yeah definitely
41:12 - would be awesome if it had by default
41:14 - I'm guessing within the next 12 months
41:16 - hopefully hopefully it should it should
41:19 - have it I mean now that that'ss stable
41:20 - hopefully the next Point as far as I
41:22 - know that's what Unity is focusing on
41:23 - basically get it Sable and then build
41:25 - all kinds of things on top of it so
41:27 - maybe uh one uh one year from now maybe
41:30 - by then there won't be quite a bit more
41:33 - systems I don't know do you call all the
41:35 - time not all the time because I also
41:37 - have to do all kinds of things I have to
41:39 - read the comments answer questions I
41:41 - have to do research on all kinds of
41:42 - things I have to walk my dogs go to the
41:44 - gym do all kinds of things that are
41:46 - non-programming but yeah I do spend
41:48 - quite a bit of time programming because
41:49 - it's the thing that I love to do okay so
41:51 - now let's build some nice projectiles
41:53 - cuz I think that should be fun so let's
41:55 - figure out how am I going to do that so
41:57 - first let me actually construct a brand
41:59 - new empty game object call it some kind
42:01 - of bullet and now for this one let me go
42:04 - back into authoring and on the bullet
42:07 - let me go inside and put a sphere just
42:10 - make some kind of visual so let me move
42:13 - the bullet where's the bullet like this
42:16 - make the bullet oh actually I don't
42:17 - think I have
42:18 - some okay let me just
42:21 - uh put over here a new material a crap I
42:26 - really dis like this thing in unity 6
42:27 - where if I right click on top of the
42:29 - material go up here to create material
42:31 - creat a material variant but I don't
42:32 - want a variant so I got to remember to
42:35 - right click on top of that that is
42:36 - really annoying that is something that I
42:37 - definitely got to get used to it so let
42:39 - me make a bullet
42:41 - material and then going to my bullet
42:43 - over here and also a DOT thing I got to
42:45 - make sure to get rid of the collider
42:46 - this was one of the things that I
42:48 - learned that was quite annoying which is
42:50 - if you have a collider in a child object
42:52 - and then you ineni that entity it is
42:54 - going to ineni it with a flat hierarchy
42:56 - instead of having a child parent
42:57 - relationship so that is that is
42:59 - something that is really annoying took
43:00 - me quite a long time to figure out so
43:02 - that was definitely definitely part of
43:04 - the uh learning process of learning how
43:07 - dots works okay so let me put it like
43:09 - this and put some a mission because a
43:10 - mission is always fun although I'm not
43:13 - sure if
43:15 - I okay I do have a little bit of a
43:17 - mission so some like this and then just
43:19 - make it a little bit smaller so I don't
43:21 - know. five 4.3 okay like this it should
43:25 - be good so I've got a nice
43:27 - bullet right
43:30 - there me dos RTS well the goal for this
43:33 - is indeed to make a DOT scores but not
43:36 - on un me just because un uh un me has a
43:39 - ton of limitations like for example it
43:41 - doesn't support uh free samples of more
43:44 - than like an hour and my goal with this
43:45 - course is going to be have a paid
43:47 - version and then a free version like the
43:49 - first few hours of the course and doing
43:51 - it like that I couldn't do it like that
43:53 - with yud me so I'm not so that is why
43:55 - I'm basically going to do it sort of
43:57 - using the same thing that I was using is
44:00 - that properly available for 2D that is
44:02 - actually a good question that I'm
44:03 - honestly don't know the answer as far as
44:05 - I know the answer is no that Sprite
44:07 - renders are not suppor but if I go up
44:10 - here and I create a 2d object and I
44:12 - create a random Sprite if I do this and
44:15 - now I start playing yep that one is over
44:18 - there and if I look inside the
44:21 - runtime uh not this one the runtime if I
44:25 - look inside the runtime this one does
44:26 - have bunch of of things it does have a
44:28 - Sprite written component so as far as I
44:30 - know uh 2D is not suppor but when I
44:33 - create something over here it does work
44:35 - so I have no idea what is the answer
44:37 - that does seem very strange so that is
44:39 - definitely something that I won't have
44:40 - to research quite a bit but yeah like
44:44 - for example for these selection areas
44:45 - over here I was using just a regular uh
44:48 - Sprite until I remember that technically
44:50 - they are supposedly not supported but
44:51 - apparently they are so anyways that is
44:53 - something that I definitely have to
44:55 - definitely have to figure out so yeah
44:56 - thanks so much for the Super Chat and
44:58 - other ones thanks so much finally please
45:00 - make very series for that for the RTS
45:02 - yep definitely I will that is that is
45:04 - the goal that's why I'm researching so
45:05 - yeah hopefully you will all enjoy this a
45:07 - lot and should be should be really nice
45:09 - uh learning thing for anyone who wants
45:12 - to learn either dots or RTS that should
45:14 - be
45:15 - interesting interest for my questions
45:17 - are your Unity course in the comments uh
45:20 - I'm pretty sure I just answered all the
45:22 - questions like two hours ago when I was
45:23 - entering things so I don't know maybe
45:26 - post again just in case I didn't see it
45:28 - but I'm pretty sure I've seen it so uh
45:32 - okay all right let me do a little bit
45:35 - more work and then I'll answer some more
45:36 - things so first of all is I need a
45:38 - reference that for the thing that I'm
45:40 - going to spawn so for that I've been
45:43 - using this so basically over here for
45:44 - the bullet prefab I spawn all kinds of
45:46 - prefabs then convert them into
45:50 - things looks like Al and go yeah
45:53 - actually that hairstyle was indeed
45:55 - inspired by by Goku so I guess if it is
45:57 - in in white or gray it doesn't look like
46:00 - alining so that that's actually a cool
46:03 - reference uh okay so the entity so this
46:06 - one is for the bullet
46:08 - prefab so I put the building prefab put
46:10 - the bullet prefab and let me just uh so
46:13 - now here comes the question how do I
46:15 - handle the shooting do I make a
46:18 - system just for
46:20 - shooting or do I put them on the moving
46:23 - so these are the kind of questions that
46:24 - I
46:25 - still still have
46:28 - uh issues trying to figure out what is
46:30 - the correct answer but well let me try
46:34 - doing just
46:36 - say uh yeah let's try doing it like that
46:39 - and then I'll try doing the other thing
46:41 - as well so this let me go entities let
46:44 - make a system for the what do I call it
46:46 - unit shooting system something like this
46:50 - so we're going to have a nice system I
46:52 - don't need y un create I don't need
46:54 - destroy so just Val like this okay so
46:57 - for this
47:00 - one so for each and now I'm going to
47:03 - have an entity do I need the entity
47:06 - actually don't think I need the entity
47:07 - but in uh system api. query let's query
47:11 - for what uh query I need no I need the
47:15 - with all the units so actually for the
47:17 - query I just need the target
47:19 - enemy the target enemy with all with all
47:24 - of the units so basically I'm going to
47:26 - cycle through all the units that have
47:30 - that so oh and actually this requires
47:33 - the refer W no R cuz I'm only going to
47:36 - read it so the ref r o for the Target
47:41 - enemy Target
47:43 - enemy and in there I do this okay so if
47:48 - Target enemy dot what did I call didn't
47:50 - I call Target what do I call it Target
47:54 - entity so why is this one not oh cuz I'm
47:57 - inside that one okay value. Target
47:59 - entity if this one is not and I think
48:02 - this is how you check if it is not an
48:04 - empty so if this one does have a
48:06 - Target if so then I'm basically going to
48:09 - want to spawn so go inside the system
48:11 - API uh in order to how do I
48:14 - instantiate is it only through the nty
48:17 - manager this is the one thing that
48:18 - always uh still drives me quite a bit as
48:21 - I'm trying
48:22 - to as I'm trying to figure out all the
48:24 - things is trying to remember what kinds
48:26 - of things exist inside the system API
48:28 - what kind of things exist inside the uh
48:30 - entity manager what kinds of things are
48:33 - through the world and so on
48:35 - so so that has definitely been one of
48:37 - the interesting challenges on learning
48:39 - all this not Super Chat hey video on
48:41 - proceed on generation yeah that is
48:43 - definitely one of the many many topics
48:45 - on my to-do list like I literally have
48:49 - uh have almost a thousand uh potential
48:53 - video ideas on my to-do list so yeah
48:55 - there are so many things that I would
48:56 - love to cover but figuring out all the
48:57 - time to cover it is actually quite uh
49:00 - quite tricky so but hopefully one day
49:03 - cuz yeah proceeding generation is very
49:05 - uh interesting actually just the other
49:07 - day I think I mentioned on a video
49:09 - recently I don't know on the wave
49:11 - function collapse that is definitely one
49:13 - of the algorithms that I would love to
49:14 - research so if some of you don't know
49:17 - want to do uh uh Precision generation
49:20 - definitely look into wave function
49:21 - collapse because it is a very
49:23 - interesting algorithm basically you've
49:24 - got a grid position a grid uh a cell and
49:28 - in the cell you've got like 10 possible
49:29 - options then you place something and
49:31 - then each of those options have some
49:32 - kind of rule so like this one can only
49:34 - be next to this one this one can only be
49:36 - under this one and so on and according
49:38 - to those rules as soon as you place one
49:40 - position randomly it is going to apply
49:42 - all those rules in order to place all
49:43 - the other points so it's actually uh a
49:46 - very interesting algorithm definitely
49:47 - such something that I very much would
49:49 - like to would like to research
49:52 - okay so I think I have to go to the
49:54 - state. enti manager in in order to
49:57 - create an entity and I'm going to create
49:59 - the
50:00 - entity but for that I'm going to need to
50:04 - okay let me remember how I did it on the
50:06 - building placement manager so I go and
50:08 - set that one and I instantiate it and
50:10 - then I move it so yeah actually pretty
50:15 - simple oh crap
50:19 - uh so the the spawn bullet entity so I'm
50:25 - going to go inside The state. Entity
50:28 - manager oh it's instantiate that is why
50:30 - that is why I wasn't so how did I get
50:32 - the entities
50:35 - reference okay that's how I got it so I
50:37 - need to get but I think over here on
50:39 - this one I can go through the system API
50:41 - in order to get a Singleton get the
50:43 - Singleton of type what did I call it
50:46 - entities
50:48 - references okay so I think this one is
50:50 - going to entities references so I get
50:54 - this one and now from that one I can go
50:56 - inside and grab in this case the bullet
50:58 - prefab so I grab that one and then I go
51:01 - to state no actually in the I think the
51:04 - system API has it in order to set the
51:06 - component data except just set component
51:08 - set of set component data which is a bit
51:09 - strange but okay spawn B
51:12 - entity so I spawn the bullet and then I
51:15 - position the bullet on the same position
51:17 - as this one so let me actually modify
51:19 - this one let me grab the ref arrow for
51:21 - the Target enemy and then a ref Arrow
51:24 - also for the local
51:27 - transform so then over here let me just
51:29 - grab both of those so for down and ref R
51:33 - of the local transform local transform
51:36 - and now from that one yeah I can
51:38 - actually just SP on literally the same
51:42 - isn't it local
51:43 - transform oh right inside that one and
51:47 - that okay so Bas like this if I set an
51:49 - empty it is going to spawn it I don't
51:51 - like this is actually going to be messed
51:55 - up yeah wish I could instantiate myself
51:58 - that would be that would definitely help
52:00 - me uh quite a bit uh okay let me just
52:03 - put a timer here which by the way
52:05 - technically you're not supposed to make
52:07 - timers inside systems that's another
52:09 - thing that is going to be quite
52:11 - interesting uh time. Delta time so let
52:14 - me just so if timer is bigger than zero
52:18 - then return and if not I put timer
52:21 - equals uh 1 second so spawn a bullet
52:24 - every second if it has something so
52:26 - let's see if this does work okay Super
52:29 - Chat thanks so much musky Dev you're a
52:31 - legend bro oh nice we see all this kind
52:34 - of view making games what games does
52:36 - Code Monkey play that is actually a
52:39 - tricky question because I'm always so
52:40 - busy building things that I don't have
52:42 - much time to play things so yeah that is
52:44 - actually trick I mean lately for uh
52:46 - doing research for this I've been
52:48 - playing uh they are Billings actually
52:50 - really awesome game so if some of you
52:52 - don't know I mean I mentioned it in the
52:54 - steam power.com
52:56 - I mentioned the video so if you like
52:58 - rtss then they are Billings it's
53:00 - definitely really awesome it's a really
53:02 - great game with tons and tons of units
53:04 - like literally well not literally
53:06 - billions of units but almost so yeah if
53:09 - you like rtss with tons and tons of
53:11 - units then I can definitely recommend
53:12 - this so yeah it's uh definitely
53:15 - interesting then I'm also a big fan oh
53:18 - that you're not signed in I've never
53:19 - seen this little Banner that's
53:21 - interesting uh I'm also a big fan of
53:24 - factorio I've also spent many many hours
53:26 - on there so yeah Factory games
53:28 - management games so basically the kind
53:29 - of games that I make are also the kind
53:31 - of games that I love to play so another
53:35 - one that I really enjoyed and I really
53:36 - want to get back to is valheim I played
53:38 - it back when it came out and I know it
53:40 - has had tons and tons of updates even
53:42 - though it's definely still in Early
53:43 - Access so yeah this definitely one and
53:45 - it's also it's one that I want to come
53:47 - back to play just for fun but also want
53:49 - to come back to play uh in order to do
53:51 - some research because I think it would
53:52 - be really awesome to make a complete
53:54 - course on making a game like this cuz I
53:55 - think that would be really awesome
53:57 - something that is third person action
53:59 - RPG elements house building system
54:01 - multiplayer all those things I think
54:03 - that would be really cool really awesome
54:04 - so yeah I definitely would like to would
54:07 - like to play it for fun and play it for
54:08 - research in order to make for I think
54:10 - that would be really awesome so yeah as
54:13 - always so many ideas of so many things
54:15 - that I very much would like to do I just
54:16 - need to I just need to find a time
54:18 - machine to be able to do too many things
54:21 - at once that would be okay uh actually I
54:23 - think this is going to be a null
54:25 - reference yep there you go there it is
54:27 - or an argument exception that's
54:30 - interesting I'll bring out an invalid oh
54:32 - that's right cuz entities are not
54:34 - references so that is why it doesn't
54:35 - have that you have donation alerts uh
54:38 - not alerts but I've got this nice little
54:40 - uh thing that shows up if you do a super
54:42 - chat so yeah I don't have any donation
54:44 - like on PayPal or something like that no
54:46 - I don't have that so just over here on
54:49 - YouTube the thing okay so I just need to
54:51 - drag so on the en's reference I need to
54:53 - drag the bullet so let me make the
54:54 - bullet into a pream
54:56 - and then just drag that one on there no
54:59 - that one over there yep okay let's see
55:01 - if this would
55:04 - work only TOS when they I'll be back in
55:06 - gev oh yeah definitely go for it if it
55:09 - is something that you want to do
55:11 - definitely go ahead and do it look at
55:12 - that they are spawning bullets
55:15 - yay it looks so silly so simple but this
55:18 - is the beginning of how something works
55:21 - yeah Target tet targeting gets
55:23 - interesting when you have thousands of
55:24 - units in range yeah I'm I'm very curious
55:27 - to one make this game and two push it to
55:29 - the Limit and see just how far just how
55:32 - far uh dots can be pushed so that should
55:35 - be
55:36 - interesting make this live stream
55:38 - overlay actually have multiple tutorials
55:40 - on that so if you go onto that page
55:42 - right there if you go on to that page
55:44 - and you go down to the bottom you can
55:46 - see so this only thing down here is a
55:47 - transparent Unity window by the way
55:49 - these aren't links so you can click on
55:50 - these in in order to watch the tutorials
55:53 - so this a transparent Unity window then
55:54 - the characters these are mesh based
55:56 - animations the way they they move up and
55:58 - down they walk left and right then in
55:59 - order to interact with YouTube API
56:01 - that's really just doing an HTTP request
56:02 - regly from inside unity and then for the
56:04 - randomization on the characters that's
56:06 - exactly the same thing that I did on the
56:07 - guest spr sheets in unity why they push
56:09 - each other you mean the units over here
56:11 - just because they are literally going to
56:13 - the same point so they're constantly
56:14 - trying to go to the one single point so
56:16 - they're constantly trying to push each
56:17 - other around then as one pushes the
56:19 - other one pushes back and so on so that
56:21 - is why they get like that basically the
56:23 - only thing missing is it needs some kind
56:25 - of uh code to say okay as soon as you've
56:27 - gotten uh close
56:29 - enough if if you can't get any closer
56:32 - stop moving instead of doing what
56:33 - they're doing which is they're
56:34 - constantly trying to get in so they're
56:36 - constantly trying to push each other and
56:38 - they never stop so yeah just needs that
56:41 - little logic in order to make that
56:45 - work where's the place of dots in the
56:47 - future nobody really knows but I would
56:50 - say the best place is in the back end of
56:53 - everything so that even if you're not
56:54 - intentionally using dots in your game
56:56 - if you just have it uh if you just make
57:00 - games by using Game objects everything
57:01 - in the background is going to be using
57:02 - dots so hopefully that is the ultimate
57:05 - goal is get to a point where even if you
57:07 - yourself don't directly use dots or
57:09 - directly use enties or anything like
57:10 - that just by using regular game objects
57:12 - all the back end is going to be much
57:14 - much faster than dot so basically
57:15 - everyone will benefit from that
57:18 - so I heck signal low poly medieval pack
57:21 - for free to make tutorial uh I'm not
57:24 - sure but uh yeah already got tons and
57:27 - tons of assets so that is some that uh
57:31 - usually my issue is more time to make
57:33 - tutorals as opposed to finding the asses
57:36 - for it so yeah uh what was I doing uh
57:39 - the bullet okay so the Bullet needs to
57:41 - know where it's going to go actually the
57:44 - bullet could technically also have the
57:46 - exact same targeting thing right so if I
57:48 - go inside the bullet and on the B did I
57:51 - remove that one I did remove that one I
57:53 - think uh so if I add the target enemy
57:56 - authoring so basically this one is also
57:57 - going to be able to have a Target enemy
57:59 - so I spawn the bullet and then I go into
58:02 - the system API in order to set the
58:03 - components set the component of type
58:06 - Target
58:07 - enemy and on this spawn bullet entity
58:10 - and new Target enemy it's going to be
58:14 - the same one right right yeah so I can
58:16 - just access Target enemy. Val R so it's
58:19 - basically going to receive the exact
58:20 - same enemy and then all I need is really
58:23 - just a system in order to take the
58:24 - bullet and move them left right and so
58:26 - on we play GTA 6 I mean I still haven't
58:30 - played GTA 5 it's quite crazy how I
58:32 - bought it on a steam sale in like
58:34 - 2015 I bought it because I thought okay
58:37 - I'm eventually going to play this so I
58:38 - might as well pick it up and nope I
58:40 - still haven't found the time to play it
58:41 - so yeah definitely looking forward to
58:43 - finally playing that game and eventually
58:45 - playing GTA 6 when it does came out so
58:48 - yeah definitely U cuz yeah I've Loved
58:50 - all of the GTA games those are
58:52 - definitely very fun so definitely would
58:54 - like do okay so let me go into entity
58:56 - mechanized system it's going to be what
58:58 - do I call it like bullet mover system
59:01 - something like
59:02 - this let's do the bullet mover system
59:05 - and I don't need the create I don't need
59:07 - the on Destroy and so on all right so
59:09 - now over here on the on update what am I
59:12 - going to need I'm going to need to grab
59:14 - the bullet grab the UN local transform
59:16 - and just move it towards the target so
59:17 - let me do a for each and I'm going to
59:19 - need local transform which is going to
59:21 - be a ref RW because I'm going to need to
59:23 - move it okay so I need local transform
59:26 - local transform then I'm going to need
59:29 - the refar for the Target enemy in order
59:32 - to figure out where am I going to Target
59:34 - it so Target enemy and I think that's it
59:37 - I think that's it okay so for this in
59:40 - system api. query let's query for a ref
59:44 - RW of local transform and a ref r o of
59:48 - Target
59:50 - enemy just down right yes I think
59:54 - so so so get that one and that one so
59:57 - basally I've got those and then I just
60:00 - get the float three for the move
60:04 - direction that is going to be the target
60:05 - enemy right cuz I got
60:09 - to trying to think about the the target
60:11 - for the
60:13 - thing
60:16 - uh right so I think I need to go into
60:18 - the system API in order to get the
60:20 - component okay I can for local transform
60:24 - I get this one of the target enemy. val.
60:28 - Target entity so I get this one so
60:30 - that's a local transform for the Target
60:32 - local
60:33 - transform so I get this one so the move
60:36 - direction is going to be this one minus
60:37 - the local
60:38 - transform uh this one. position minus
60:41 - that one do
60:42 - position value r o. position okay so
60:46 - basically I get those and I get the move
60:48 - direction that I'm going to move into
60:49 - and can I normalize no that is another
60:53 - thing that drove me crazy for a while is
60:55 - how they are two there's normalized
60:56 - normalized safe I have no idea what is
60:59 - the difference between them I've tried
61:00 - seeing the documentation and I couldn't
61:02 - quite figure it out but I tried using
61:04 - normalized and it was all messed up but
61:06 - normalize save should be good there be a
61:09 - recording Yep this should be recorded So
61:12 - if you check afterwards it should indeed
61:14 - work how to make a replay Sy Min Unity I
61:16 - mean the basic idea is you just have a
61:18 - list of like I mean depends on what
61:20 - you're trying to replay but if you're
61:21 - trying to uh uh say for example the
61:24 - positions that the players move then you
61:26 - basically just have a list of vector 3
61:28 - and you record okay on frame one the
61:29 - player was on this position frame two
61:31 - was on this position so on so basically
61:32 - on every update you have to record the
61:34 - state that you want to record so for
61:36 - example the player position so on every
61:37 - update you go onto that list you add
61:39 - okay the player was on this position and
61:40 - this and this this and then when you
61:42 - want to play back that demo you
61:44 - basically just go back into the
61:45 - beginning of the list and just grab some
61:47 - kind of player dummy object grab the
61:48 - position apply to that one so the
61:49 - players here then here here and so on so
61:51 - basically you just just save the data
61:54 - that you want to save and and then load
61:56 - thata that you want to load for the
61:58 - reload so yeah so that's one of those
62:00 - things that doing the super basic thing
62:02 - is super basic making something more
62:04 - complex going to be quite a little bit
62:07 - like GT5 with its own video yeah that
62:09 - becomes quite a bit more complex but uh
62:12 - what is the uh what do they call it
62:15 - Unity photo mode Unity has this really
62:19 - awesome package where if you want to do
62:21 - something like that where basically you
62:22 - can pause the game and have control this
62:24 - is more so basically you would have that
62:26 - kind of Replay system then on top of it
62:28 - you would Implement something like this
62:31 - so definitely look into that one if you
62:33 - want to do something like that where you
62:34 - can basically pause the game then
62:35 - control some camera move it around
62:37 - modify all kinds of things take a
62:38 - screenshot record some video and so on
62:40 - so I would definitely start looking into
62:42 - that
62:44 - one we have multiplayer for this course
62:46 - uh so far I'm just focused on single
62:48 - player but afterwards who knows I'm I'm
62:51 - not sure I mean the uh kitchen chaos
62:53 - course that one start as something
62:54 - simple and then I decid to add
62:56 - multiplayer so who knows maybe maybe not
62:58 - but so far for the at least the first
63:00 - iteration just focusing on single player
63:02 - learning how to make it work with with
63:04 - uh dots and so on you have a Discord
63:08 - Community uh actually there is a private
63:10 - Community for channel members and
63:12 - patreon supporters and the only reason
63:14 - why it's private is because I tried once
63:15 - in the past many years ago tried to make
63:17 - a public Discord and it just devolved
63:19 - into chaos like I couldn't be there 24/7
63:23 - so I couldn't really moderate and tons
63:25 - of Bot tons of people uh joined there
63:28 - and started posting nasty images and all
63:30 - kinds of things so yeah that was really
63:32 - messed up and that is why I had
63:33 - to that is why now as trying doing it uh
63:38 - I did it more of a private thing so it's
63:39 - a much smaller community and sectionally
63:41 - pretty nice so if you are a channel
63:43 - member or patreon supporter check one of
63:45 - the posts on there and it will have the
63:47 - link for that Community okay so let me
63:49 - just how' you learn English the answer
63:51 - is by watching carttoon Network I spent
63:54 - most of my childhood watching that with
63:55 - no subtitles no things so I basically
63:57 - had to had to learn very quickly and and
64:01 - I didn't learn so trying to learn day by
64:04 - day learning each each word each thing
64:06 - eventually I I was able to to watch a
64:09 - cartoons and obviously programming
64:11 - program is in English I've been
64:13 - programming since I was 10 years old so
64:14 - that also helped quite a bit okay so on
64:16 - the uh local transform. value RW because
64:19 - I want to write onto it value
64:22 - RW and basically I'm going to go go
64:26 - inside uh this guy dot now let me read
64:30 - in order to
64:31 - translate so I'm going to want to
64:33 - translate onto this move Direction times
64:36 - need some speed float speed let's put 3F
64:40 - uh times some kind of speed times system
64:42 - api. time. Delta
64:45 - time okay so yeah so the Bullet should
64:47 - be able to fly towards an enemy right
64:50 - right I think that is correct so let me
64:53 - just go ahead and try out and see if
64:55 - this work work is there a romantic song
64:57 - in the background it should be the low
65:00 - five beats which is actually pretty nice
65:02 - usually very soft very calming great uh
65:05 - great kind of music for doing any kind
65:07 - of programming working that is actually
65:09 - really
65:11 - good look at that got an error right
65:13 - away why do I have an
65:15 - error
65:17 - uh The Entity does not exist What entity
65:20 - does not
65:22 - exist okay
65:26 - is this on my own code or I can't read
65:29 - down there I'm
65:34 - just nope okay so this seems like
65:38 - a a Unity bug let me just
65:42 - save okay so
65:45 - that's
65:46 - strange entity does not exist but What
65:49 - entity aend destroyed okay it seems like
65:51 - I found a random Unity bug cuz at least
65:54 - this one there's no
65:56 - the call stack does not come from my own
65:58 - code nope something on the component
66:01 - system
66:02 - group okay let me try
66:05 - just commenting out this one to see if
66:09 - the code is supposedly the thing that is
66:11 - faring the
66:14 - error DT does not exist yeah I've seen
66:17 - this kind of message so many times
66:19 - especially over here in the scene view
66:21 - okay so why does that
66:23 - one oh so maybe
66:26 - maybe it was actually an accurate
66:29 - message related to an error in my code
66:30 - just a terrible error message I think
66:34 - the thing I think the issue is yeah I
66:37 - think the issue might be or no I was
66:40 - going to say I think the issue might be
66:42 - for the what in the
66:45 - world is this
66:48 - running debug that log not that one unit
66:51 - the engine that debug that log
67:00 - let start with unity six months ago your
67:03 - videos have been biggest help that's
67:04 - awesome hey I'm glad the videos have
67:06 - helped you definitely go ahead I hope
67:08 - they help you on your Learning Journey
67:11 - and okay I have no idea why this The
67:13 - Entity does not exist What entity what
67:16 - system.
67:17 - string what are you
67:21 - doing okay first of all I I forgot
67:24 - something here so that is kind of my but
67:25 - also this shouldn't be so basically the
67:27 - issue is over here I'm not targeting
67:28 - just bullets so that is kind of an issue
67:31 - but I still have no idea why that one is
67:32 - saying this message argument out of
67:35 - [Music]
67:36 - range is it a Target enemy no because
67:39 - then this wouldn't run on anything that
67:41 - does not have a Target enemy but it
67:43 - should be okay I think maybe the issue
67:47 - is that
67:48 - one so I think I think I found the issue
67:51 - so basically it's
67:53 - see yeah the debug messages over here
67:55 - inside of dots are sometimes very oh
67:59 - look at that hey Andre hey thanks for
68:01 - becoming a channel member uh yeah I
68:03 - think the issue
68:05 - is I think I figured out the issue yeah
68:08 - that's the issue n. okay so basically
68:10 - the issue is that I forgot over here to
68:11 - add the make sure that this query only
68:13 - runs on bullets so basically the target
68:15 - entity this one is set to null because
68:17 - the uh the units they do have this
68:19 - target enemy but the entity in there is
68:22 - set as null so that is why so that is
68:24 - why over here this one is calling uh get
68:26 - component on a null entity and that is
68:29 - why it was throwing an error but this
68:30 - error is very not not helpful argument
68:33 - and I have no idea why it doesn't
68:35 - actually me yeah cuz down here on the
68:37 - stack trace it doesn't actually oh it
68:40 - does well I just didn't see that okay
68:42 - the bullet mover system so it does say
68:43 - yeah that was the issue anyways
68:46 - thankfully that is a super simple fix I
68:48 - just need to make sure to tag the
68:50 - bullet so I'm make a new mon Behavior
68:52 - script bullet authoring
68:55 - and I'm just going to tag this one with
68:58 - the bullet so let me just go up here uh
69:02 - I'm going to have a public struct for
69:04 - bullet it's going to be I component data
69:07 - okay I component that and I don't need
69:09 - anything this one is just a tag so then
69:11 - a public class for a baker class Baker
69:14 - of type bullet
69:16 - authoring and then over here Implement
69:19 - that one and I'm going to get the entity
69:21 - get the entity this one is going to move
69:23 - so like this and entity for that one and
69:27 - then I just add component add component
69:29 - onto this entity and we going to add a
69:31 - new
69:32 - bullet okay so this one now tags the
69:34 - bullet and on this one I'm going to look
69:36 - for things that have a Target enemy the
69:39 - local transform with all with the bullet
69:44 - component okay so now this one is only
69:46 - going to run the bullets and now this
69:47 - one should be working I believe I
69:51 - believe that should be
69:52 - working what keyboard do you have oh uh
69:55 - what is the name of this it's say
69:59 - Logitech what do you call
70:03 - it uh oh God I have no idea oh no I
70:05 - think I got the little overlay thing I
70:08 - think it's the g15 is that it yeah
70:12 - that's it Logitech g15 so that's the
70:16 - thing like that then the Pro Wireless
70:18 - mode the microphone a bluei and then the
70:21 - camera over there is a c922 so basically
70:24 - that's my
70:26 - uh basic setup like that uh okay so is
70:29 - this working let's see if this is indeed
70:33 - working uh okay so now if I go and if I
70:36 - select that
70:37 - one okay it is spawning bullets but oh
70:42 - it's spawning and moving
70:44 - there okay but why are you not
70:49 - moving okay so let's see why they are
70:52 - not moving
70:55 - [Music]
70:57 - cuz then go inside of that one doesn't
70:59 - the oh I did not add the tag that is why
71:03 - got to go inside of here and tag it as a
71:06 - bullet bullet authoring so it's got the
71:09 - target enemy it already has transform
71:10 - and it's got the B othering so this one
71:13 - should not work so let's see any that
71:16 - visual bug that just happened that
71:18 - something that I got to figure out how
71:19 - to solve cuz basically as it spawns a
71:21 - bullet it always spawns it for 1
71:22 - millisecond over here for one frame it
71:24 - renders it on 0 and then renders it over
71:27 - there yeah there you go so now that one
71:28 - is spawning bullets and I can select all
71:31 - of them tell them all to attack and
71:32 - there you go so many bullets and they
71:34 - are not being destroyed so let me look
71:37 - inside the uh entity hierarchy uh or was
71:41 - that entities
71:43 - hurric let's see over there how this one
71:45 - is spawning more and more
71:48 - bullets oh yeah same one frame is yeah I
71:52 - have no idea I think I think the answer
71:55 - so that problem is going to be over here
71:56 - on the systems so I think the answer is
71:59 - it has to make sure to run before the
72:01 - rendering but at the same time that
72:02 - doesn't makes sense
72:04 - because because I'm uh both spawning and
72:07 - then moving the Bonet right away so I'm
72:10 - spawning it and then I'm setting the Lo
72:11 - trans so I have no idea why that one is
72:14 - why that one is rendering for one frame
72:17 - down here and then moves there I have no
72:19 - idea that is definitely very
72:21 - strange pulling still thing with dots I
72:24 - don't think so I mean technically you
72:27 - can have some kind of pulling system you
72:29 - can create multiple entities and then
72:31 - reuse them but the main goal with dots
72:34 - is really how it's super easy in order
72:36 - to uh create and destroy all kinds of
72:39 - objects so this one is probably on the
72:41 - on how many well that one is taking why
72:44 - is that one taking so long I have no
72:46 - idea uh but yeah in dots spawning things
72:50 - is
72:51 - so 340 really that many that bullets
72:55 - that's uh interesting uh so yeah
72:58 - spawning and destroying entities it
73:00 - should be relatively
73:02 - simple can Define the position in
73:04 - intiation good question I don't think so
73:08 - can intiate the output entities no these
73:11 - are just the thing so you can spawn
73:12 - multiple entities instead of just one so
73:14 - nope you can't set the position directly
73:16 - on there so you have to spawn it then
73:18 - you have to move it but yeah I have no
73:20 - idea why this one isn't uh doing it like
73:23 - the oh crap uh why that one
73:26 - isn't why that one is spawning in just
73:28 - one position for one frame I have no
73:30 - idea why so I'll have to figure that out
73:32 - but anyway so yeah over here it is
73:35 - indeed working spawning tons of En okay
73:36 - now let's make sure to destroy those
73:38 - entities when they do reach there so if
73:40 - I go inside my B mover
73:43 - system and over here just check the
73:46 - distance so if the uh does math have
73:50 - distance math do distance it does have
73:53 - or I guess distance Square would make
73:55 - probably more sense uh between the uh
73:59 - this one this local transform do value
74:02 - r. position between this position and
74:05 - the target local transform.
74:08 - position so if the distance is within
74:11 - like I don't know uh 1 F that's probably
74:14 - too much let's put it 2 F something like
74:17 - this then I'll figure it out so hold for
74:19 - destroy distance put it on 2f ah crap 2f
74:24 - and
74:25 - and so if it is within that one then I
74:27 - have to destroy it now let's figure out
74:29 - how do I
74:30 - destroy say the workflow is like
74:32 - compared to game objects I mean
74:34 - considering how a lot of it is literally
74:36 - the same so like for defining what is a
74:38 - unit what is a bond and so on I'm using
74:40 - just the regular uh game object
74:42 - components like over here I'm attaching
74:44 - normal game object components I'm using
74:46 - a normal rigid body component normal box
74:48 - letter and so on so considering that
74:50 - it's actually a lot of the workflow is
74:52 - actually very similar cuz for the most
74:54 - part I'm working with game objects which
74:55 - then gets baked into all kinds of uh
74:58 - entities with entity components and all
75:00 - kinds of things so the workflow is
75:02 - actually relatively straightforward so
75:04 - far the
75:05 - biggest the biggest difficulty is in
75:07 - learning how to have a different mindset
75:09 - and trying to think about what should be
75:11 - a system how many systems should I have
75:13 - that do different
75:15 - things and what things should be do
75:17 - systems as opposed to just monob
75:19 - Behavior systems so like in the
75:20 - beginning I was making everything in
75:22 - dots but then I figured out like over
75:24 - here for examp the unit selection
75:25 - manager this one isn't really a
75:27 - performance critical kind of thing I
75:29 - just have one unit selection manager
75:30 - that manages the selection of the
75:31 - various units so for that one it makes
75:33 - more sense to just make it in mon
75:35 - behavior and just use regular code and
75:37 - then when I want to select the uh the
75:39 - entities then I can interract with the
75:41 - dots world so that that has been the the
75:43 - main thing is trying to figure out what
75:45 - should be an entity and what should be a
75:46 - mon behavior that is
75:48 - actually that has been the biggest
75:49 - challenge but in terms of workflow it's
75:51 - actually been surprisingly
75:53 - easy uh Photon Fusion to nope the only
75:56 - the only uh networking stack I've used
75:58 - is net for game objects which works
75:59 - pretty well but all of those are very
76:01 - good so if you use uh Photon if you use
76:04 - fishnet and so on those are all uh as
76:07 - far as I know those are all very good so
76:08 - you can't really go wrong with any of
76:10 - those so
76:12 - yeah okay let me
76:14 - just uh stop the um the the B mover
76:20 - system okay once it gets let me destroy
76:22 - it now how do I destroy it is it through
76:24 - the system AP II destroy entity nope I'm
76:28 - guessing it's going to be from this guy.
76:30 - entity manager destroy entity that is
76:33 - probably going to be it this R oh now
76:35 - that's a good question cuz that is going
76:37 - to trying to think that is going to be a
76:40 - breaking change okay so now I got to
76:42 - remember how do I make an entity command
76:47 - buffer okay that's going to be a tricky
76:50 - one so I don't remember how this was
76:53 - done yeah I think it's like that so use
76:56 - an allocator dot what was it called the
76:59 - allocator dot uh this one just going to
77:02 - be a temp I think so destroy the nty but
77:05 - I have to do it on the ENT command
77:07 - buffer in order to destroy an entity so
77:09 - I'm going to want to destroy this guy
77:11 - right here so I have to get the with
77:13 - entity access for this one entity for
77:16 - the entity for the uh bullet entity okay
77:20 - so I've got the buet entity and then
77:21 - down here I tell that one in order to
77:23 - destroy this buet entity so I go through
77:25 - this whole cycle does all that and now
77:27 - didn't command buffer tell to playback
77:29 - and this one requires an N manager so
77:32 - that is going to be the state. entity
77:35 - manager okay so I think that's it and
77:37 - this one should now be destroying the
77:39 - bullets as soon as they reach the target
77:41 - so let's see if it
77:45 - does will this be uploaded later yep the
77:47 - video is set to record and then have the
77:51 - thing so it should then work is that a
77:53 - an error no that's okay I don't know you
77:55 - must dispose the buffer I don't think so
77:58 - I think when you make it temp it
77:59 - automatically dispose so I don't think
78:01 - that is but I'm not 100% sure so I don't
78:05 - know if you need
78:06 - to I don't know but I I as far as I know
78:09 - if you use temp it automatically dispos
78:11 - of it so I don't think you need to
78:13 - manually but I'm not 100% sure so let us
78:16 - see if that is the case and why is this
78:17 - one still firing this message okay get
78:19 - rid of that all right so if I click on
78:21 - that one any he spawning bullets and let
78:24 - where's my
78:25 - the entities Hy window where is it this
78:28 - one on this one and spawning yep it is
78:31 - spawning in the spring bullets let me
78:33 - actually hide the if I hide the
78:36 - plane just hide the plane and yep CU
78:39 - they are going to the bottom yeah they
78:41 - get there and they get destroyed as soon
78:43 - as they can close all right awesome so
78:45 - those are some nice bullets super basic
78:48 - but yeah I can select oh crap cuz I
78:50 - disabled the plane so now I can select
78:52 - multiple let me enable the plane like
78:54 - multiple all of them attack that one and
78:57 - boom every point three they attack they
79:00 - fire bullets and so on okay now we make
79:03 - some kind of uh health system which I
79:06 - think is going to be an interesting
79:08 - challenge challenge in the sense
79:12 - of spawning in 0000 Z execution order of
79:15 - the
79:15 - systems I mean that's what I think but
79:18 - in theory I'm spawning the units over
79:20 - here inside of the simulation group
79:22 - whereas in reality the rendering should
79:23 - only happen down here so that was my
79:25 - first thought is that it's something
79:26 - related to do with the system order but
79:29 - that shouldn't make sense because the
79:31 - entities are being spawned here and then
79:33 - they're being rendered here so I'm not
79:34 - sure that doesn't seem to make much
79:37 - sense so maybe they need to be spawned
79:39 - in some previous point I don't know that
79:41 - is definitely something that I willon
79:43 - have to research cuz yeah the U thing in
79:45 - which they visibly spawn over there that
79:47 - is uh quite
79:51 - something uh okay so let me make some
79:54 - kind of Health thing activate subscene
79:57 - from another scene I'm not sure I
79:59 - haven't used subscenes too much so far
80:01 - I've only done this so had a normal
80:03 - scene with an ntity subscene I haven't
80:05 - done anything more complex than that so
80:08 - I don't know anything portfolios in
80:11 - order to progress from software into
80:13 - Game Dev here in Portugal uh the answer
80:15 - is I don't really know just because I'm
80:17 - not too familiar with the whole job
80:19 - market thing but in general I would say
80:22 - a portfolio is very important because a
80:23 - portfolio basically
80:25 - shows to a prospective employer what you
80:28 - can do so I would definitely say that
80:30 - you so I definitely say a portfolio is
80:33 - always a good thing have a portfolio
80:34 - that showcase what you can do what you
80:36 - built by yourself personally I would say
80:38 - that is probably more useful than having
80:40 - a random degree although I'm sure there
80:42 - are some companies that do prefer degree
80:44 - so yeah I'm not sure but I do know that
80:46 - having a portfolio doesn't hurt so yeah
80:48 - I would definitely try to do
80:50 - that that update before the transform
80:52 - system group oh maybe maybe that's it
80:55 - maybe that's it actually that's a good
80:56 - point that's a very good point cuz maybe
80:59 - that might be it because I'm actually
81:01 - setting the
81:02 - data yeah maybe that is it cuz I was
81:05 - thinking that it was a rendering thing
81:06 - like why is it rendering on thing that
81:07 - it was on previous frame whereas in
81:09 - reality it might be actually related to
81:11 - the transform system where it's being
81:13 - where it's being uh posted in one place
81:16 - then move so if I uh let me go into the
81:19 - bullets the bullet mover
81:21 - system update before so before what
81:25 - before the local tal system maybe uh
81:30 - let's write that type of the local to
81:33 - World
81:35 - system so let's see if this one does
81:38 - indeed move it actually move it
81:41 - before your stream while working yeah
81:43 - definitely oh hey thanks for the Super
81:45 - Chat hey M Laboratories do you think
81:47 - it's worth using dots to handle
81:49 - background processes like a trading game
81:51 - that has a lot of trade rout yeah I
81:52 - would definitely say that is the kind of
81:55 - problem that is absolutely perfect for
81:56 - Dots is all the games that are ah crap
81:59 - it still has it still does let's see oh
82:03 - never mind I'm using the Bol mover I
82:05 - should see the unit shooting so let's
82:07 - try on this one and see uh but yeah all
82:10 - the things that happen in the background
82:11 - those are pretty much just those are
82:13 - basically just that operations in order
82:14 - to do trades between one faction and
82:16 - another one those are definitely the
82:18 - kind of things that would do really well
82:20 - in being in the background
82:22 - so ah crap it still
82:25 - show than I put it there I saved so this
82:27 - one is now running the uh unit shooting
82:31 - system where's the
82:32 - unit no it is not wait is this I assume
82:36 - this is ordered from top to
82:39 - bottom is because it is not in
82:43 - the
82:46 - group how do
82:48 - I how do I
82:51 - spawn cuz I put update before right
82:55 - that's it right update before update in
82:57 - group so maybe I have to do I have to
83:00 - put update in group maybe that's it I've
83:03 - got to put it on
83:05 - the trans transform system group maybe
83:10 - it has to be inside that group in order
83:11 - to update before that
83:13 - one let's
83:21 - see oh can I do update before before
83:24 - group itself cuz that would help okay so
83:28 - now it is shooting before let's see
83:30 - let's
83:31 - see okay yeah that that might have done
83:34 - it so yeah all right so that's awesome
83:36 - now let's just try that one so update
83:38 - before the group does that actually
83:40 - spawn it in there yes or no let's
83:46 - see let's see if that one does show up
83:50 - before the group it does show up before
83:51 - the group okay so great so yeah learning
83:53 - something new that is awesome so you can
83:55 - do update before with the group instead
83:57 - of just being a system so that is cool
83:59 - and apparently the issue was indeed that
84:00 - so I was thinking that it was a
84:01 - randoming issue so thank you I'm sorry I
84:03 - don't know I don't know who said that
84:05 - but yep that is indeed the solution so I
84:08 - was thinking that it was a rendering
84:09 - thing so why is it rendering the
84:10 - position that it was in the previous as
84:12 - opposed to the answer is that this
84:13 - shooting system this one is running
84:15 - after the local toal system and that
84:17 - apparently is a system that actually
84:18 - positions the entities where they should
84:19 - be so that is why they were showing up
84:21 - for one frame like that so yeah thank
84:23 - you so much whoever give that tip cuz
84:25 - yeah that is indeed the solution so
84:26 - right now they're indeed spawning and
84:28 - they are no longer spawning for one
84:30 - frame so yeah nice awesome that is
84:34 - cool can dispose Destro system at
84:37 - runtime when you don't need it
84:38 - anymore uh good
84:41 - question I think you can but I'm not
84:43 - entirely sure the only thing that I know
84:45 - is you can do state. enabled so if you
84:48 - want to disable a system from running
84:49 - you can just modify that one but in
84:51 - order to actually destroy it
84:54 - destroy itself nope clean up
84:57 - nope so yeah I don't know if you can
85:00 - destroy itself I guess technically maybe
85:02 - you could destroy the system handle the
85:04 - system entity attached to the system I'm
85:06 - not sure
85:07 - [Music]
85:09 - so so I'm not sure but technically if
85:12 - you disable the system it shouldn't have
85:14 - any overhead at all so hopefully if you
85:17 - need something then just doing that
85:19 - should work okay okay let me just try
85:23 - implementing some some health system try
85:26 - to do that just in order to destroy the
85:28 - enemy and then I'm probably probably
85:31 - going to go because my voice is already
85:32 - quite messed
85:35 - up say something in
85:39 - [Music]
85:47 - Portuguese
85:51 - inid
85:53 - um you create Game Dev TV course why in
85:55 - 3D course use broadcast message in set
85:57 - of events I'm not sure I don't know what
86:02 - what
86:03 - uh I've done one of their 3D course and
86:06 - it was really nice so that is why I can
86:08 - recommend because the code quality was
86:09 - really good but yeah I don't know what
86:11 - specific one you're referring to I mean
86:13 - there are many many ways of handling
86:15 - Event Systems messaging systems all
86:17 - kinds of things
86:18 - so using events versus not using events
86:20 - you can definitely use uh all kinds of
86:25 - all kinds of options can be
86:28 - [Music]
86:30 - good so yep right down the center uh
86:34 - okay so let me just let me try doing
86:36 - some some health so okay so I need a
86:40 - going to have some kind of health
86:42 - authoring component okay and now in this
86:45 - health authoring component what do I
86:47 - need I need a F struct Health and this
86:53 - is going to be an I component
86:55 - data okay and then inside I'm going to
86:58 - have some kind of hint for the health
87:00 - amount and then uh also have some kind
87:03 - of hint for the health amount Max right
87:06 - yeah I think like this it should work
87:08 - and then up here I've got a class I've
87:10 - got a baker class Baker of health
87:15 - authoring and then I bake it I get the
87:19 - Cent would be nice if this one was a
87:22 - little bit didn't have to write all this
87:24 - B plate code that would be that would be
87:27 - fun but anyways so add component onto
87:30 - this
87:31 - entity I'm going to add a new
87:34 - health and I'm going to need to add it
87:37 - to something so up here only H Health
87:41 - amount yeah I guess I might as well put
87:42 - both them so for the health amount
87:44 - equals the authoring health
87:46 - amount uh and then the health amount Max
87:50 - like
87:52 - this okay so so basically I got a health
87:55 - and I got a health amount Max okay then
87:57 - on the bullet mover if the bullet gets
87:59 - close enough over here it's going to
88:00 - destroy itself all right and then it's
88:02 - going to have to go onto the enemies
88:04 - over here on the
88:06 - query let me get a ref RW of type
88:11 - Health that is going to have a health
88:14 - health a ref RW of
88:17 - Health okay as soon as I damage go
88:20 - inside of that one inside the value r
88:22 - w and and I set it to what I set it to
88:27 - let me read let me read the current
88:29 - health minus
88:32 - one okay can I just this is something
88:35 - that I still don't know can I just you
88:37 - health amount minus minus does this work
88:40 - or do I have to assign the value r w I'm
88:42 - actually not entirely sure if this one
88:44 - does work so let's try it out let's see
88:46 - I just need to make sure that the enemy
88:48 - has a health authoring
88:51 - component so the health authoring
88:54 - like there and you got let's say 100
88:57 - Health okay so let's try
89:00 - it write custom templates for it Oh you
89:04 - mean for the over here for the create
89:07 - yeah they I noticed that they had a
89:08 - bunch of these these things which is
89:10 - interesting I mean it requires a little
89:12 - bit of getting used to because I'm used
89:13 - to the the giant list of all things but
89:17 - yeah adding all these of these sub
89:19 - folders it does indeed is quite okay so
89:22 - let me see the enemy and let me put the
89:24 - en me on run time and see the Health
89:27 - Data okay 100 and if I fire a bullet are
89:31 - you firing
89:32 - bullets okay why is the B not moving now
89:35 - did I forget
89:39 - something wait what oh did I put
89:44 - on on the B mover don't put that one but
89:48 - uh why are the BS not moving
89:51 - now okay that's strange
89:56 - range wait ah crap yeah I'm I'm not very
90:00 - smart I don't want the health for the
90:03 - Bullet cuz the bullet does not have
90:04 - health so yeah that is obviously not it
90:08 - I want the health for the other guy for
90:10 - the Target entity okay so I have to go
90:13 - into the system API system API right to
90:16 - get the component actually I've never
90:18 - used this one for get component RW get
90:22 - the health component the one that is
90:24 - attached to the Target enemy. val.
90:27 - Target
90:28 - entity so this the health uh the ref r w
90:33 - of Health for the Target enemy
90:36 - Health then on this one I can do that
90:39 - and modify that okay so now let's see if
90:42 - this one does work I'm not sure if the
90:44 - minus minus over here works or if I have
90:46 - to grab the value r w and then modify it
90:49 - so I guess we won't
90:51 - see or the argument
90:57 - okay okay is this a okay just every
91:01 - once's in a while an air randomly shows
91:03 - up and then apparently does not throw an
91:05 - air anymore okay so it is spawning it is
91:07 - moving okay what is this log doing okay
91:10 - still printing out that entity okay it
91:12 - is down
91:13 - one
91:15 - uh we looking the
91:18 - enemy and hell oh so it does work okay
91:22 - so that's that's good to know that's
91:23 - that to simplify things a little
91:27 - bit so basically over here in the code
91:30 - if I grab a refr w I don't have to do
91:33 - value RW equals something I can just go
91:36 - inside the Val RW and modify the health
91:38 - amount and apparently that does work
91:41 - okay that is good all right so like this
91:44 - it is indeed working let me just try
91:48 - doing a nice little health bar I want to
91:51 - be able to do that I'm trying to
91:57 - think uh okay let me try just doing a
92:01 - little health bar just make it visible
92:04 - okay but I'm going to need see now
92:06 - normally I would make a world space
92:07 - canvas that is how I would make a a
92:10 - health bar but over here that doesn't
92:12 - quite
92:13 - work so yeah I think I'm going to have
92:15 - to go with game object for some kind of
92:17 - health
92:19 - bar and inside the game object I'm going
92:22 - to have see again I'm not sure if
92:24 - Sprites are are usable or
92:29 - not uh so I think yeah I think I just
92:33 - need a regular quad that I'm going to
92:36 - have to make it look towards the
92:42 - camera okay let me it's not very
92:46 - [Music]
92:47 - red
92:50 - bar uh okay so let me
92:58 - oh crap got this got this same bug that
93:01 - happened the other day I don't know if
93:03 - this is a Unity 6 bug or a thing bug cuz
93:05 - like I click on that and doesn't let me
93:08 - modify let me select something else
93:10 - there you go some random blob has it
93:12 - reference I'm not using any blobs but
93:15 - okay something went wrong in the
93:17 - background uh can I select that one okay
93:20 - now it does work so let me just select
93:22 - the health bar and then put the health
93:24 - bar on there and
93:26 - basically I'm going to want
93:29 - to scale this a little
93:32 - bit okay so I'm trying to think how am I
93:35 - going to make this health bar can I
93:38 - actually make it with okay no mesh
93:40 - Lether none of
93:42 - that see now this is the thing that I
93:45 - have to stop and think for quite a
93:50 - while which
93:52 - is how do I the logic for updating this
93:55 - health
94:00 - bar so can I maybe
94:06 - have no cuz that one has the this the
94:10 - one thing that I still have to have to
94:12 - think about how am I going to cuz
94:15 - basically I want the health bar to
94:16 - update based on the health of just this
94:18 - one
94:20 - enemy but how do I have a reference to
94:22 - that enemy I guess I could
94:24 - have I mean I guess one way to do it but
94:27 - I don't think it's the right way so
94:29 - health bar uh
94:32 - [Music]
94:34 - authoring and basically over here I
94:36 - would have a a struct for the health bar
94:42 - I component data okay and now inside of
94:45 - this one I've got an entity for the
94:48 - entity. so Health uh Health in that
94:54 - doesn't make much sense but
95:00 - okay
95:02 - uh class for a baker class Baker for the
95:06 - health bar
95:08 - authoring so maybe like this it might
95:12 - work cuz if I got a game object or the
95:16 - um entity game object okay and over here
95:22 - entity entity equals get my entity get
95:24 - the entity this one is going to be
95:27 - dynamic okay then add component add on
95:31 - this entity a new health
95:34 - bar health bar yep and
95:36 - now health bar for the health entity get
95:39 - entity of the authoring do entity game
95:44 - objects
95:46 - okay this one and then the
95:51 - dynamic this mine does domain Rel Lo
95:53 - every single time if you're wondering
95:55 - about that that is actually something
95:57 - that is recommended that you disable in
95:59 - dots about the
96:03 - uh it's over here I think it's in
96:07 - preferences uh where it's
96:09 - on don't remember where is it it's on
96:13 - the it's on the on the project
96:17 - settings they mentioned this in the in
96:19 - the dot thing which is yeah it's over
96:21 - here project settings going into editor
96:23 - and then go down here into the when
96:25 - entering play mode and basically
96:28 - normally it reloads The Domain in the
96:29 - scene whereas uh for using with dots I
96:32 - think it's because the live link between
96:34 - the en's world and the uh game object
96:37 - World they recommend that you set to do
96:38 - not reload the on scene which does have
96:41 - some side effects like for example
96:42 - static Fields do not get reset by
96:44 - default so definitely be aware of those
96:45 - side effects but yeah if you want your
96:47 - game to uh handle the compilation a
96:49 - little bit faster then yep that is
96:51 - something that you can do okay
96:54 - put that one and then I pass in a
96:56 - reference to that one okay I have no
96:58 - idea so many errors I don't
97:03 - know so then let me try doing the uh a
97:08 - new entities I system so
97:11 - health bar visual
97:15 - system let's see if like this this logic
97:18 - is going to work I'm not sure but let's
97:21 - try it so basically I'm going to do for
97:24 - each health bar health bar in system API
97:28 - the query for a health
97:30 - bar and for this one I want a ref rro
97:34 - I'm just going to read it so ref for the
97:36 - health
97:39 - bar so basically it goes through the
97:41 - health bar and then on the health bar I
97:43 - can get the value r o and then from that
97:45 - one I can get the health entity and then
97:47 - from the system API I can get a
97:50 - component of type Health from that
97:53 - Health
97:55 - entity
98:01 - so health health on that
98:05 - [Music]
98:07 - one that one should work we review triaa
98:11 - games and shows how to recreate their
98:12 - mechanics uh yeah I mean the uh the
98:16 - uh uh how to make this one I'm
98:19 - definitely planning to continue doing
98:21 - this one a bit more but maybe you're
98:24 - referring to the How It's Made series
98:26 - that was also a fun one I really enjoyed
98:28 - making this one but yeah that one does
98:30 - require quite a bit more work in order
98:32 - to make these kinds of videos so I'm not
98:34 - sure cuz these do require quite a bit
98:37 - but definitely the how to make this one
98:38 - I definitely would like to make quite a
98:40 - few more so I made a doesn't this have
98:43 - the uh yeah plan list yeah I've got a
98:46 - plan list on this one so I've done four
98:48 - of these and I definitely would like to
98:49 - make more of them as well so RTS stealth
98:52 - Action City Builder 10 BAS yeah
98:53 - definitely would like to make quite a
98:55 - few more on that format because it is a
98:58 - fun format okay okay so basically this
99:01 - code is siling through all the health
99:03 - bars then on the health bar I've got the
99:05 - health entity that is related to that
99:06 - health bar and from that one I can web
99:08 - the health and I basally just need a
99:11 - float health normalized and that is
99:13 - going to be the health. health amount
99:15 - divide by health. Health amount Max
99:18 - except I need to cast one of these onto
99:20 - a float in order to make it work
99:23 - but then I need to
99:27 - have the visual for
99:34 - it so over here on the health bar
99:37 - authoring I need to have
99:41 - a health bar mesh game object something
99:46 - like
99:47 - this then a public entity for health bar
99:50 - mesh entity
99:53 - because that one is also going to be
99:54 - converted into an empty so
99:57 - the uh
100:00 - crap health bar mesh this one goes into
100:04 - the health bar mesh so I get that one
100:06 - and then from that one I can go inside
100:08 - the system API in order to get the
100:11 - component rrw of local transform and I'm
100:14 - going to grab it of the health bar
100:18 - do uh for the health bar. Val Ro and I'm
100:22 - going to grab the mesh entity okay so I
100:24 - grab that one that returns theow P
100:26 - transform for the help barcal
100:29 - transform and then the ref
100:34 - RW and then from this one can I modify
100:37 - the scale that is a
100:42 - question wait can't I is this not oh
100:45 - it's a field
100:54 - is this one going to
101:02 - be no cuz if feel you get wait but why
101:05 - is the I'm trying to
101:08 - think cuz why is this scale is the scale
101:11 - just a
101:12 - one no the scale is multiple or
101:16 - not yeah I guess scale is just that
101:25 - there's a scale on this
101:27 - one is the loow quty world is that the
101:30 - thing that is going to be okay I don't
101:31 - know but let's try let's try playing to
101:33 - the scale so scale equals the health bar
101:36 - normalized Health
101:40 - normalized okay so I think this might be
101:43 - working for updating the help bar so I
101:45 - guess we shall see how that goes oh boy
101:48 - my voice is really already messed up
101:50 - dating Health on each update is bad yep
101:52 - that is something that I will have to
101:54 - figure out during research CU yeah
101:56 - normally I would have the health system
101:58 - fire off some kind of event then based
101:59 - on that event update some kind of
102:02 - thing but in this case that
102:05 - doesn't uh making events in dots is very
102:09 - strange
102:12 - so uh so yeah that is definitely
102:14 - something that I won't have to research
102:16 - to figure out what is the best option to
102:21 - do because like this I I'll select one
102:24 - of these guys and I shoot it technically
102:25 - it should grow a little bit
102:29 - smaller or no is
102:31 - it oh it
102:33 - is so yeah it takes a while it's going
102:35 - down very slow and yeah it is going
102:37 - uniformly as opposed to like that
102:41 - so I don't have this drop down yeah if
102:43 - you're not on Unity 6 then those options
102:45 - look different you have one checkbox and
102:46 - then you have those so if you have if
102:49 - you want uh similar to what I have here
102:51 - take the first checkbox that says enable
102:53 - custom option and so on then leave the
102:55 - other two uh
102:57 - unticked use post transform Matrix for
103:00 - nonuniform scale uh for the scale I
103:02 - basically want
103:04 - to okay so health bar background so the
103:09 - way that I normally do uh a mesh so let
103:12 - me go over here and
103:16 - make material oh crap the same thing
103:19 - again I created a a variant accidentally
103:22 - I don't want to create create variant
103:24 - let me put this in Gray I need dark gray
103:28 - so on the health bar
103:30 - background let me put the gray
103:34 - material and now on this one over here
103:37 - so health bar mesh and inside I have the
103:39 - one with the actual
103:41 - visual so there's no visual on this one
103:43 - up here so this one is just an empty
103:46 - component this one is actually on one
103:49 - and one so this one one and3
103:53 - and this one shift it to the right by
103:55 - 0.5 and I just need to make sure to push
103:57 - it a little bit
103:59 - behind Okay now this one push it a
104:01 - little bit to the left by
104:03 - minus5 okay so now I've got this little
104:06 - X and if I modify that if I modify the
104:09 - whole thing it still get strange but
104:11 - yeah so I just need the non-uniform
104:12 - scale for the X and it should be
104:16 - good but like this actually like this it
104:19 - should let me see if it is still working
104:22 - like that let me just go over here here
104:23 - instead of making like that let's make
104:24 - it just
104:27 - 20 okay let's see if this one does work
104:30 - pick this one trigger some
104:32 - damage okay yeah that one didn't update
104:35 - needs to update in the beginning yeah
104:36 - definitely it
104:39 - is is it this one or is this
104:42 - one and I'm a little bit confused trying
104:44 - to figure out is this one modify yeah
104:47 - this one is modifying but the other one
104:49 - isn't right yeah this one is on one as
104:52 - it should be
104:53 - okay so basically it's on the local to
104:55 - world is that what I need to in order to
104:57 - have nonuniform
105:01 - scale uh cuz yeah local
105:04 - transform does this one have from scale
105:08 - it does but it only
105:10 - has so who was saying something about
105:13 - nonuniform is it local to World local to
105:17 - world does this one have non
105:21 - uniform don't like to create a popular
105:23 - game yeah sure I would love if my games
105:25 - were more popular but yeah I don't know
105:28 - the goal is to keep learning things and
105:31 - keep making better and better games
105:32 - getting more knowledge about all kinds
105:35 - of programming game development things
105:37 - so yeah that is basically my
105:39 - go see separate component oh there
105:43 - was but do I need to attach it
105:46 - to I do remember seeing some kind of uh
105:50 - local transform or local to world un uh
105:54 - was it
105:55 - nonuniform no can't find
105:58 - it but technically on the local 2 world
106:01 - doesn't this one have I thought this one
106:03 - would have
106:06 - some oh I've got to set it on the
106:08 - transform usage
106:10 - Flags Okay so let's try that one
106:15 - except okay it's on the health bar hot
106:17 - ring so on this one make it with
106:19 - non-uniform
106:21 - scale okay so let's do that one and see
106:24 - what component to bake
106:30 - does and now
106:34 - uh where is
106:37 - it on this one the health
106:43 - bar okay so I did do get uniform
106:47 - nonuniform but it doesn't seem like it
106:49 - changed modifying that one is modifying
106:51 - the whole thing yeah because I want to
106:53 - be able to modify like one of
106:56 - these nope this doesn't do
107:05 - anything so only has a regular it's got
107:08 - a post transform Matrix is this
107:12 - what okay so what is a post transform
107:18 - Matrix the post transform
107:21 - Matrix what's kind of component is
107:25 - this apparently just has a float 4x4 and
107:29 - I guess yeah my goal is simp to modify
107:31 - this one so the c0
107:33 - dox so okay so technically that means
107:37 - I've got to go onto this guy and grab
107:39 - the post transform
107:42 - Matrix grab this one so health bar post
107:47 - transform Matrix so I grab that one and
107:50 - I modify
107:54 - okay so it's the value and
107:56 - then it's apparently the
107:58 - c0 oh there's a float
108:02 - 4x4 techn like this it shouldn't work
108:06 - yeah what does that
108:07 - one Flo 4x4 what kind of function does
108:10 - this
108:12 - have oh you've got
108:14 - Oilers rotate scale does scale
108:18 - have all three you got to float X wi's
108:21 - at okay so this is probably going to be
108:24 - quite a bit better so the health
108:25 - normalize then the Y of one float Z of
108:28 - one so this is going to be the scale and
108:30 - set the not the C 0 this
108:34 - one okay so let's see if this does
108:38 - [Music]
108:45 - work all
108:48 - right okay it seems like it is working
108:50 - cuz that one already updated now f that
108:53 - one there goes a bullet and as soon as
108:54 - it gets there and there you go let go
108:56 - down all right
108:58 - awesome we have bullets being fired and
109:00 - we have an enemy taking bullets and if
109:03 - they eventually get
109:06 - enough
109:08 - and and goes into
109:10 - negatives oh right cuz I'm only
109:12 - destroying right that's the next part
109:14 - that I need which is uh being able to
109:16 - see the thing that's funny look at that
109:19 - the health bar going into negative
109:20 - Infinity but yeah it does work
109:24 - uh okay so yeah that's the next thing
109:25 - that I got to figure out is how to I got
109:29 - to make some kind of system in order to
109:30 - check the health and if the health is
109:32 - under zero if so then destroy
109:34 - it it's uh was fun so yeah thank you all
109:38 - for for your help for figuring out about
109:41 - this cuz I definitely did not know about
109:43 - this one post transform Matrix okay so
109:45 - there you go so we all learned something
109:47 - new here so if you want to make
109:48 - something that is nonuniform make sure
109:50 - to use the non-uniform scale and then on
109:52 - want some kind of thing you can grab the
109:54 - post transform Matrix and apparently
109:56 - that one has a float 4x4 which you can
109:58 - then modify so yeah after doing all that
110:01 - and I can now do that shoot and so on I
110:04 - can place down some buildings which
110:05 - don't do anything and select all the
110:07 - units move them around so yeah this is
110:11 - the little prototype is coming along
110:12 - nicely so that should be fun background
110:15 - music this is the low five beats it's
110:19 - actually on description I think it's see
110:21 - standard low five beats which is pretty
110:23 - fun uh is UI toolkit compatible with
110:26 - dots uh I mean I think you can use it in
110:30 - s that the UI toet is really just a UI
110:32 - layer so you can use any kind of UI
110:34 - layer and then and then communicate with
110:36 - the dot side in any kind of way so yeah
110:39 - technically I'm not using it here this
110:41 - just standard normal UI but yep you can
110:43 - definitely do it is there a weight list
110:46 - for this course there is a link where
110:48 - you can sign up and I'll let you know
110:50 - where's the link I don't remember where
110:51 - I put the link
110:53 - uh I think I put it over
110:55 - here uh yeah there you go so you can
110:58 - follow this link right here and you can
111:02 - uh sign up over here with your email
111:04 - address and eventually when I'm done
111:06 - with the research when I get the course
111:08 - done I'll send an email to all the
111:10 - people in there but yeah since this is a
111:12 - brand new topic really no idea how long
111:14 - it's going to take me to build this
111:16 - entire course so far it's been I mean
111:18 - I've only been researching for a few
111:20 - days and I got a decent basic prototype
111:22 - but there's still quite a lot of things
111:23 - that I've got to research quite a lot of
111:25 - things that I've got to do so so yeah
111:29 - really cool that you stream this if you
111:31 - have a chance do more yeah definitely
111:32 - would like to but uh yeah it's always
111:35 - figuring out what time works that is
111:37 - definitely tricky but honestly for this
111:39 - kind of research it actually works well
111:41 - with uh researching live with a bunch of
111:44 - people so so yeah hopefully as I'm doing
111:47 - research for this project that should
111:49 - make for some interesting live streams
111:51 - where I try to do some work and try to
111:52 - answer some questions all kinds of
111:53 - things so yeah um no offense but how are
111:56 - you using a light theme I'm super used
111:58 - to having dark mode ever the answer is
112:00 - because my eyes do not work well with
112:01 - dark mode if I put this on dark mode
112:03 - especially especially the code if I put
112:05 - this in black with the with the letters
112:07 - in white I get a massive headache after
112:09 - looking at it for just 10 seconds so I
112:11 - know a lot of people love dark mode but
112:13 - for me literally does not work I don't
112:15 - know something wrong with the way my
112:17 - eyes work I don't know what it is but
112:19 - yeah if I put this on dark mode I get
112:20 - massive headaches and I can't write code
112:23 - for more than 10 minutes so yeah that's
112:25 - that's uh that's pretty much
112:28 - it okay so yeah my voice already pretty
112:30 - messed up definitely got to stop a
112:32 - little bit cuz yeah I'm definitely not
112:33 - the kind of person who can do live
112:35 - streams for very long cuz I can't really
112:38 - talk that much so
112:40 - yeah switch light things when I'm watch
112:43 - yeah I mean if you like both definitely
112:46 - go ahead and use both but yeah for me
112:49 - definitely like light mode and all kinds
112:51 - of things why don't you use find object
112:53 - of type instead of USE events with
112:54 - single T I mean if you have just a
112:56 - single object of a type you can use it
112:58 - that one used to be super slow
113:00 - previously nowadays I think that one is
113:01 - not necessarily as bad so technically
113:04 - nowadays you can use that one but yeah
113:06 - normally I like using sylon so I pretty
113:10 - much use Singleton super easy to access
113:12 - all kinds of things uh you said
113:13 - components do not have any Behavior yep
113:15 - they only hold data but can they have
113:19 - properties I think they
113:21 - can I think so in the sense that I don't
113:24 - think anything stops you so over here
113:27 - public
113:28 - entity Health
113:30 - entity and you can do with a get and a
113:33 - set so I'm pretty sure the code does not
113:36 - stop you from doing this but technically
113:38 - you're
113:40 - not technically the way they the unity
113:43 - themselves talk about best practices is
113:45 - really just use these as data container
113:47 - so yeah no error so technically you can
113:49 - do this so if you want you can you can
113:51 - do it but usually the the format they
113:54 - tell you to follow is really just make
113:55 - things just make public fields to hold
113:58 - all data that the component needs so
114:00 - yeah that is basically the the
114:02 - guidelines that they encourage you to
114:04 - follow all right so yeah I'm going to
114:07 - rest my voice for a little bit take a
114:09 - little bit of a break so yeah I hope you
114:11 - enjoyed this live stream I've certainly
114:13 - enjoyed doing a bunch of research
114:15 - telling to all you so hopefully this was
114:17 - interesting all right so going to go put
114:20 - down like that and like
114:23 - that and game objects and dots I mean
114:25 - game object is a standard way and dots
114:27 - is entity so kind of different way so
114:29 - object oriented versus data oriented
114:31 - different things but both can make games
114:33 - all right so yeah thank you all uh so
114:36 - much for being here I hope to do these a
114:38 - little bit more often should be fun
114:39 - should be interesting but yeah that's
114:42 - going to be it for me today so I hope
114:44 - you have a great rest of your day doing
114:46 - whatever it is you're doing so yeah have
114:48 - a great day and see you next time all
114:50 - right bye everyone bye
