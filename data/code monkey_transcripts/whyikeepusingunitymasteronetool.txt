00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod Maki so
00:02 - last month during the whole Unity
00:04 - pricing Fiasco there was naturally a lot
00:05 - of conversation regarding engines in
00:07 - general and there's one sentiment that
00:09 - kept popping up in various comments all
00:11 - over the place which I really don't
00:12 - agree with and that is the sentiment
00:14 - that you should diversify yourself and
00:15 - learn lots of engines instead of just
00:16 - one now on the one hand I kind of agree
00:19 - with that sentiment if you know multiple
00:20 - engines and one of the engine makers is
00:22 - something really stupid like the
00:23 - original plan that un was going for in
00:25 - that scenario if you already know
00:27 - another engine then makes it super easy
00:28 - to switch so I can see that benefit
00:31 - where if you do need to switch and you
00:32 - already know something else that makes
00:33 - it super easy but on the other hand I
00:35 - think people are vastly underestimating
00:37 - just how much it matters to master a
00:39 - specific tool if you're trying to keep
00:41 - up with multiple engines multiple tools
00:43 - at the same time you'll never really
00:44 - Master any of them and mastering tool is
00:46 - basically a superpower that makes
00:48 - everything much much easier the
00:49 - difference in terms of productivity and
00:51 - efficiency between just being good at
00:52 - something and being an expert the
00:54 - difference is massive the benefits it
00:56 - gives you about being extremely
00:57 - knowledgeable about how your tool works
00:59 - and how to build whatever you want to
01:00 - build that is really something that is
01:02 - insanely valuable and should not be
01:04 - underestimated and that is really
01:05 - something that I think a lot of those
01:07 - commenters are missing when they say
01:08 - sure if you want stick with un but learn
01:10 - in real at the same time or try out in
01:12 - real but learn good do at the same time
01:14 - now I can agree with giving multiple
01:16 - engines a shot just doing some surface
01:18 - level research in order to see how each
01:20 - one operates how each one is good at
01:21 - some things and not so good at another
01:23 - things but I really think that after a
01:24 - while you should pick just one doesn't
01:26 - matter which one it is all that matters
01:28 - is just pick one and just master that
01:30 - tool also I want to be clear what I'm
01:32 - saying here has nothing to do with unity
01:33 - specifically or any specific game engine
01:36 - what I'm saying here is regarding
01:37 - mastering a tool whatever that tool may
01:39 - be so that can be Unity it can be unreal
01:41 - it can be gdau it can even be blender or
01:43 - Maya it can be gim versus Photoshop the
01:46 - concept of mastering something versus
01:48 - just being good at it that concept is
01:49 - really appable to anything not just any
01:51 - tool not just Unity now the thing that
01:53 - made me want to make this video is
01:54 - pretty much the last month where I
01:56 - definitely experienced this benefit
01:57 - firsthand I just launched my latest this
01:59 - game dinky Guardians early this month
02:01 - and one month before that in early
02:03 - September back then the game was in a
02:05 - completely different completely
02:06 - unfinished State I had to Sprint like
02:08 - crazy and write an ungodly number of
02:10 - lines of code to build a ton of features
02:12 - to get the game ready for release in
02:14 - such a short period of time in that
02:15 - month there were many and I do mean many
02:17 - problems many examples of things that if
02:20 - I was not as experienced with my game
02:21 - engine of choice if not I would not have
02:23 - been able to make the game in time
02:25 - things like for example the 3dui I
02:27 - wanted to make the game visually a bit
02:29 - more interesting so I thought it would
02:30 - be really nice to make the UI in 3D also
02:33 - animated and make some nice effects as
02:34 - you inspect the single machine now if I
02:37 - did not have the 10 years of experience
02:38 - that I have with unity if this were the
02:40 - first time that I was going to build
02:41 - something like this then just building
02:43 - this one simple feature just building
02:45 - this would probably have taken me a week
02:46 - to research how to do it and actually
02:48 - implement it whereas in reality thanks
02:50 - to all my experience with the engine
02:51 - building all this took I don't know
02:53 - maybe just like 3 hours I already knew
02:55 - that I could make a 3D World space
02:56 - canvas I already knew how the volume
02:58 - system worked and how to add the depth
03:00 - of field effect and I also already knew
03:02 - how to use cinem machine to trigger a
03:03 - camera transition now I already knew all
03:06 - that because I had done it previously
03:07 - this was not my first time working with
03:09 - any of these tools any of these features
03:11 - so this really is the power of
03:12 - experience which is really just not a
03:14 - name for mastering your chosen tool
03:16 - another example was in early September
03:17 - the game did not have controller support
03:19 - which for me was crucial I absolutely
03:21 - wanted the game to be playable with the
03:22 - controller and again this is something
03:24 - where if it were my first time
03:25 - implementing it it would have probably
03:27 - taken me over a week to get this done
03:29 - but since I've already done this many
03:30 - times before I literally just re-watched
03:32 - my own input system tutorial to get a
03:34 - quick refresher for how it all works
03:36 - then I refactored the code to implement
03:38 - game pad support and everything worked
03:39 - in just one afternoon yet another
03:41 - example is a character customization if
03:44 - I was not already extremely familiar
03:45 - with how components work what is a mesh
03:47 - skin mesh render how the UI buttons work
03:49 - and so on if I did not have all of that
03:51 - knowledge then again building this scene
03:53 - would have taken over a week of work
03:55 - where in reality building all this took
03:57 - less than one day literally in the
03:58 - beginning of that day this scene did not
04:00 - exist at all I just had a rough idea in
04:02 - my head and by the end of that day I had
04:04 - this really nice 3D UI with this nice
04:06 - character of the buttons with all the
04:08 - data loaded all functional nicely
04:10 - animated everything working perfectly I
04:12 - had all that alongside a character safe
04:14 - system which again I did at the same way
04:15 - that I've always done it it was really
04:17 - easy to save the character precis
04:19 - because I already knew how to use player
04:20 - prefs synchronizing GES in multiplayer
04:22 - was also very easy because again I
04:24 - already know how to use net Cod for game
04:25 - objects so the fact that I already know
04:27 - so much about so many various topics
04:29 - because I've already done those
04:30 - previously in the past because that I
04:32 - can build something complex like this in
04:34 - such a short period of time even the
04:36 - entire intro spaceship level none of
04:38 - this existed just one month before
04:40 - release so all this scripted tutorial
04:42 - logic all the cut scenes the video
04:43 - player the placement of all the machines
04:45 - all the custom interactions I built all
04:48 - of this in pretty much just about a week
04:50 - so what I'm trying to say in this video
04:51 - is that it is much much better to Master
04:53 - One tool rather than just being mediocre
04:55 - or just decent at a handful of tools
04:57 - especially as an indev you need to be an
04:59 - absolute expert at using your particular
05:01 - tool you need to be working at insanely
05:03 - high efficiency if you want to make it
05:04 - in this really tough business and again
05:06 - this is not specific to Unity you can
05:08 - use whatever engine you want whether it
05:10 - be unity and real gdau anything you want
05:13 - my point with this video is really just
05:14 - to advise you to master it tool of your
05:16 - choice rather than try to learn five
05:17 - different ones and I also don't want
05:18 - this video to come about as me bragging
05:20 - about my skills or anything like that
05:22 - what I want to do this video is
05:23 - literally the opposite of that
05:25 - personally I don't believe that I'm
05:26 - special at all I believe that you two
05:28 - can be as productive as I am YouTu can
05:30 - build all these features that I built in
05:32 - just one month You2 can produce a really
05:34 - complex game like this one that I made
05:35 - in just 6 months pretty much the only
05:37 - thing that stops you is probably the
05:38 - fact that you don't have the 10 years of
05:40 - experience and tens of thousands of
05:41 - hours that I have using Unity I started
05:44 - using unity all the way back in 2012 and
05:46 - I've made nine complete Steam games with
05:47 - it once you do have this level
05:49 - experience then you two won't be able to
05:50 - make such complex things so quickly
05:52 - basically after using a to for this long
05:54 - there are very few things that are truly
05:55 - 100% new by now every new mechanic that
05:58 - I want to build every new game
05:59 - everything that I want to learn
06:01 - everything is always somewhat related to
06:02 - something that I've learned in the past
06:03 - which makes it so much easier to learn
06:05 - new things and build new things so this
06:07 - is the topic that I really wanted to
06:08 - talk about because I saw a lot of people
06:09 - sharing comments with that sentiment of
06:11 - how you should really learn multiple
06:13 - engines at the same time and personally
06:14 - I don't think that's exactly the best
06:16 - approach I think you should take your
06:17 - time to pick one engine but then after
06:19 - you pick it actually master that tool
06:21 - learn everything about it so you can be
06:22 - extremely efficient with it so I hope
06:24 - you found helpful to hear my point of
06:26 - view on this check out dinky Guardians
06:27 - with seam thanks for watching and I'll
06:29 - see see you next time
