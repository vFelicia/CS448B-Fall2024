00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and as you may know i have my own very
00:04 - detailed courses they don't have the
00:06 - unlimitations on youtube so i'm not
00:08 - dependent on placing the algorithm and
00:09 - having to keep the videos under 20
00:11 - minutes so each of those courses really
00:13 - diving deep into various topics i have
00:15 - went on making a builder defender game
00:17 - just like i make my own steam games one
00:19 - on mastering visual scripting and
00:21 - another one on explaining 50 unity tools
00:23 - and features courses are an excellent
00:25 - way to learn they provide a different
00:26 - path to free tutorials i actually cover
00:28 - this topic in detail in another video
00:30 - each type has its own pros and cons
00:33 - so courses are excellent but as you
00:35 - might imagine it takes a ton of work to
00:36 - produce a complete high quality course
00:39 - so i'm simply not able to make all the
00:41 - types of courses that people ask me to
00:42 - make
00:43 - however even if i can't build it myself
00:45 - because i don't have the time i can
00:46 - certainly point you to some course that
00:48 - already exists that i can highly
00:49 - recommend a while ago i got in touch
00:52 - with the folks at gamedev.tv and i
00:54 - worked with them to create a special
00:56 - code monkey bundle with courses
00:57 - specifically curated by me i went
00:59 - through all of their courses and had
01:00 - selected three of them to be part of a
01:02 - bundle which includes a really nice deep
01:04 - discount the course i selected are the
01:07 - ultimate unity 3d course this is the
01:09 - number one highest rated unity course
01:11 - it's actually the course that i
01:12 - researched while i was trying to make my
01:14 - own courses i wanted to see what the
01:16 - best courses were like and this was the
01:18 - highest rated one with tens of thousands
01:20 - of very happy students it was completely
01:22 - remastered recently so all of the
01:23 - content is really nice up to date it
01:26 - will teach you both unity and c-sharp
01:28 - both them starting from scratch so you
01:29 - will gain knowledge on game design
01:31 - problem solving 2d and 3d games as well
01:33 - as practical exercises on every lecture
01:35 - to really solidify everything you're
01:37 - learning the next course isolate for the
01:39 - bundle is the blender 3d course this is
01:42 - the one that i picked up a couple of
01:43 - months ago and i've been learning
01:44 - blender ever since after just watching
01:47 - about 30 of this course i tried making a
01:49 - bunch of assets to make a nice minigame
01:51 - and it came out really nice it's really
01:53 - massive takes you through the making of
01:55 - seven completely unique asset packs in
01:57 - all kinds of styles you start off making
02:00 - some simple bowling bone pens then you
02:02 - make an interesting chess set some
02:03 - modular building parts and tons more
02:06 - and the final one is a more advanced
02:07 - really interesting programming course
02:09 - it's all about programming patterns this
02:11 - one is excellent for helping you
02:13 - massively improve the quality of your
02:15 - code which in turn helps you make better
02:16 - games faster learn how to spot some bad
02:19 - practices how to refactor bad code into
02:21 - clean code learn about the observer
02:23 - pattern singletons factories delegates
02:25 - strategy polling and tons more if you're
02:28 - an intermediate or advanced programmer i
02:29 - think you'll really like this one all of
02:31 - the courses have a 30 day money back
02:33 - guarantee so you can try them out
02:34 - without fear so the bundle itself has a
02:37 - really deep discount but there's many
