00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and right now there's a massive sale
00:04 - happening on the cinti store as you
00:05 - might know I'm a huge fan of their low
00:07 - poly style I've used them in tons of my
00:08 - videos pretty much all of their packs
00:10 - are discounted at Half Price along with
00:12 - some flash deals with a Deeper Discount
00:13 - every week stay tuned for the video
00:15 - tomorrow where I made a fun mini game
00:17 - using the pack that is on the flash deal
00:18 - this week looking at all of these packs
00:20 - giving me tons of ideas for all the
00:22 - kinds of games that I could build
00:23 - honestly I really wish that I could just
00:24 - stop time and build 50 mini games using
00:27 - all these packs the recently released
00:29 - dolphin Realms that one would be perfect
00:31 - for some kind of game inspired by Lord
00:32 - of the Rings maybe an RTS game like the
00:35 - awesome Battle for Middle Earth games or
00:37 - maybe something more stealthy unlike the
00:38 - upcoming Golem game with the military
00:40 - pack you could make a really nice first
00:42 - person shooter that pack has tons of
00:44 - weapons and attachments so just for that
00:46 - it would be fun to make a mini game all
00:48 - about setting up a weapon the ancient
00:50 - empire pack that one is one of my
00:51 - favorites I love the Greek slash Roman
00:54 - theme I used it in my camera system
00:55 - video I could see something like Age of
00:57 - Empires made with something like this or
00:59 - maybe an action game inspired by 300
01:01 - maybe something like the game Rye son of
01:03 - roamed the dock pack would be perfect if
01:06 - you need some kind of companion in your
01:07 - game I've been wanting to use this bag
01:09 - to make a simple companion AI tutorial I
01:11 - think that would be fun The Heist pack
01:13 - is one that I've also used many times
01:14 - like for example in the destruction
01:16 - video it's pretty cheap and has tons of
01:18 - stuff so with this I would love to make
01:20 - some kind of Co-op Heist game another
01:22 - great one that is also pretty cheap is
01:24 - the Battleground pack this is what I use
01:26 - in the third person shooter video
01:28 - it's got tons of props and a nice Island
01:30 - so again it's perfect for a Battleground
01:32 - game one genre that I love to play are
01:34 - Tycoon games so the shops pack would be
01:37 - perfect for exactly that it includes a
01:39 - massive amount of props so you could
01:40 - make an entire multi-coon game or really
01:42 - just one of these shops if you'd like to
01:44 - make a city Builder something like City
01:46 - skylines then the city pack would be
01:47 - great for that a long time ago there was
01:50 - a nice bundle with some City assets and
01:52 - I made three unique games with those I
01:54 - made a nice farming game with the farm
01:55 - pack really nice I made an RTS with the
01:58 - Sci-Fi space pack also came out really
02:00 - well and I made a card game like Crazy
02:02 - Taxi using the town pack related to cars
02:05 - the street racer pack is also really
02:07 - awesome this is the one that is on the
02:08 - extra deep discount on the flashlight on

02:14 - this pack to make a fun drag racing
02:15 - minigame just recently I announced my
02:18 - sim game called dinky Guardians for the
02:20 - environment of that one I use the metal
02:21 - Forest pack they have three nice
02:23 - environment packs I really like these
02:25 - ones because personally I suck at worm
02:27 - building so being able to have some
02:28 - something made by a professional artist
02:30 - is really great and in my game I'm also
02:32 - using the particle effects pack I really
02:34 - like this one definitely very useful in
02:36 - tons of scenarios it has lots of effects
02:38 - that can represent whatever you want
02:40 - another very useful one is the icons

02:44 - of nice 3D icons that would fit any game

02:48 - mention pack it's what I used in the v
02:51 - Rising video very spooky tons of props
02:53 - and some scary characters they also have
02:55 - tons of character packs with near
02:57 - infinite customization I use the fantasy
03:00 - characters pack in the character

03:03 - back to that one in order to make the
03:04 - part 2 of that video there's the fantasy
