00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - here's an interesting Video Game Dev
00:03 - mistakes that destroy your game
00:06 - [Music]
00:10 - three years of work on my game and
00:13 - nothing no sales no wish lists no money
00:16 - for the steam holiday sale wow right
00:18 - away yeah that stuff but suddenly that
00:20 - is not uncommon if anything my advice to
00:22 - you would be don't spend three years
00:24 - working on your game especially not your
00:26 - very first game when you're just
00:27 - starting out and you're trying to learn
00:29 - you really want to be able to learn with
00:30 - as little risk as possible so yeah for
00:32 - your very first game my advice is don't
00:34 - go anything further than some like two
00:36 - to three months I made a video quite a
00:37 - long time ago on seven steps you can
00:39 - take to become an end Dev and in the
00:41 - beginning I do say make tons and tons of
00:43 - games because you will learn so much
00:44 - more by actually finishing and
00:46 - Publishing a bunch of games you'll learn
00:47 - so much more than just working on one
00:49 - massive game over several years right
00:51 - now I'm working on my next team game
00:52 - which is meant to be a three to four
00:54 - month full-time project depending on
00:55 - your skills and experience you can get
00:57 - quite a lot done in a few months if you
00:58 - have a clear plan I don't know what I
01:00 - did wrong I need a Christmas miracle
01:06 - all right this game is going to be
01:08 - amazing I think I'll just start with all
01:10 - my art assets
01:12 - holy and this is the first mistake
01:15 - who are you
01:17 - I'm you and I'm here to save you from
01:19 - all of your beginner Game Dev mistakes
01:22 - I'm just making my art assets what's
01:24 - wrong with that exactly you spend way
01:27 - too much time on your art during the
01:29 - Prototype phase sure yeah that's an
01:31 - interesting tip you should definitely
01:32 - make a quick prototype in narrative to
01:34 - actually validate the idea however at
01:36 - the same time some game ideas are
01:38 - heavily influenced by the art
01:40 - so depending on what game you're trying
01:41 - to make it might not necessarily be a
01:43 - terrible idea to spend some time making
01:44 - the art assets although at the same time
01:46 - when I say spend some time I don't mean
01:48 - spend months maybe depending on the
01:50 - genre it might be why I suspend perhaps
01:52 - the very first week working on nothing
01:54 - but art assets trying to get the mood of
01:56 - your game figuring for something like a
01:57 - visual novel or a point of Click game
01:59 - something where the art is absolutely
02:01 - essential on those kinds of games that
02:03 - might not necessarily be a mistake but
02:05 - yeah for most games if you're making a
02:06 - platformer a strategy game a action game
02:08 - something like that then getting the
02:10 - gameplay up and running as quickly as
02:11 - possible that is definitely going to be
02:12 - much more important than spending tons
02:14 - of time on making polish art not to
02:16 - mention that as the game develops you
02:18 - won't permanently replace the art anyway
02:19 - so yeah there are some exceptions but in
02:21 - general yeah definitely don't spend way
02:22 - too long working on Art right at the
02:24 - very beginning by focusing on Art during
02:26 - this early phase you have less time to
02:29 - devote to making sure the gameplay
02:30 - within the Prototype is actually fun
02:33 - don't even use those assets I completely
02:35 - changed my art style later on yeah
02:38 - that's the thing that happens especially
02:40 - if you spend way too long in the game to
02:42 - the point where your skills actually
02:43 - improve and then you want to make you
02:45 - want to redraw the assets once again
02:46 - with better skills so yeah do not go
02:49 - overboard on the art right at the very
02:50 - beginning so I should just work on the
02:52 - ugly gray box prototype and yep
02:55 - definitely do spend time working on an
02:57 - ugly gray box prototype the thing is if
02:59 - your ugly gray box prototype if that
03:01 - thing is fun to play then when you add
03:03 - all kinds of visual Sparkle effects and
03:04 - punch on top it won't be even more fun
03:06 - to play so one good technique is
03:08 - definitely made tons of prototypes make
03:10 - them super quickly and then just
03:12 - experiments and see which one of those
03:13 - actually plays right because again if it
03:15 - does play great while it's looking
03:17 - terrible then it won't feel extremely
03:19 - awesome when you finally add all kinds
03:21 - of polishing visuals gameplay Loop
03:22 - instead you would have had a much
03:24 - stronger gameplay Foundation
03:26 - hence the first mistake not focusing on
03:29 - gameplay early making a game involves a
03:32 - lot of moving parts and it's extremely
03:35 - easy to get distracted by all the things
03:37 - that need to be built making a finished
03:39 - character asset and Polished textures
03:41 - may make the Prototype more visually
03:43 - appealing but the main thing that will
03:45 - make people wishlist buy and play your
03:48 - game is the game part visuals May grab
03:51 - someone's attention but the gameplay
03:53 - will make them stay also related to this
03:55 - is when you're trying to make some kind
03:57 - of demo or perhaps a vertical slice in
03:58 - order to get funding from a publisher in
04:00 - this case this comes after this phase
04:02 - after the pro timing phase when you have
04:04 - the game nice and solid it can be wise
04:06 - to spend a bunch of time just polishing
04:08 - just a tiny sliver of the game just
04:10 - making what is called the vertical slice
04:11 - just doing that getting that all
04:13 - polished up as much as possible in order
04:15 - to hopefully get some funding or maybe
04:17 - start to promote your receipt page
04:19 - two years
04:22 - hey I'm back what are you working on
04:26 - oh God I made it just in time I followed
04:30 - your advice and focused on gameplay I'm
04:32 - just doing some some play testing which
04:34 - is super great but my brother in game
04:36 - devs you're just asking your friends and
04:38 - family to play today well yeah but
04:40 - asking strangers is hard and scary who's
04:42 - gonna play your game and do you think
04:44 - your friends and family are going to
04:45 - give you a solid critiques yeah I guess
04:48 - not so what should I do well for
04:50 - starters ask your friends and family but
04:52 - take their feedback with a grain of salt
04:54 - yeah friends and family are definitely
04:56 - great for a first initial thing but you
04:58 - always got to keep in mind where that
05:00 - feedback comes from always keep in mind
05:01 - that feedback is always going to be
05:03 - slightly biased towards the positive
05:04 - side because they're friends and family
05:06 - they're your friends so they're not
05:07 - going to be brutally honest at least not
05:09 - as really honest as actual scene players
05:11 - won't be when you finally release your
05:13 - game so do get them to play your game
05:15 - and read through their feedback but do
05:17 - keep that positive bias in mind I just
05:19 - had a similar example to this when I
05:21 - recently released the seam neck Fest
05:23 - demo for my game most of the feedback
05:24 - that I got were actually from people
05:26 - that found this Channel and if they
05:28 - watch his channel if they enjoy the
05:29 - videos that I do there will definitely
05:30 - be much more biased towards the positive
05:32 - side rather than the regular steam
05:33 - audience you want strangers anyone and
05:36 - everyone to test your game flight
05:38 - testing often gets pushed aside during
05:40 - the development process or you put it at
05:42 - the very end but in reality you want
05:44 - people to be testing your game early and
05:46 - often play testing is really market
05:48 - research it lets you know how people are
05:51 - receiving your game your mechanics your
05:53 - art style and gives you an idea where
05:56 - you might be blind to certain issues
05:58 - with your game so get initial
06:00 - Impressions favorite parts parts they
06:02 - hated and things they think are missing
06:04 - every piece of information is useful
06:07 - yeah waiting list of things definitely
06:09 - get their initial Impressions read so
06:11 - many games nowadays you really gotta
06:12 - hook the player as soon as possible
06:13 - especially since nowadays going on a
06:15 - steam Festival is super important and on
06:18 - a scene Festival you are providing a
06:19 - free demo and you are competing with
06:20 - tens of thousands of other demos so for
06:22 - that you really got just a few minutes
06:24 - in order to really hook the player so
06:25 - initial impressions are extremely
06:26 - important the favorite Parts also really
06:28 - important in order to figure out what
06:30 - people like about your game so you can
06:31 - do more of those least favorite parts so
06:33 - you can either reward worth the design
06:35 - in order to make them not the least
06:36 - favorite in order to make them a bit
06:37 - better or perhaps just cut them out
06:39 - entirely at some point there are some
06:41 - mechanics that just don't work no matter
06:43 - how much you want them to so in order to
06:44 - improve the game sometimes cutting a
06:46 - mechanic is really the best approach and
06:48 - things missing like if lots of your
06:50 - players are telling you oh I wish I
06:52 - could pause the game to take my time and
06:53 - go things slowly that is really great
06:55 - feedback on things that might be missing
06:57 - that might even be super easy to add but
06:59 - you might have never thought about and
07:00 - that might make your game much much
07:02 - better you don't need to implement every
07:04 - single idea or change but at least be
07:06 - aware of how your game is being received
07:07 - yeah definitely also that's another
07:09 - thing do not just blindly Implement
07:12 - every idea that anyone tells you
07:13 - remember that you are a developer so you
07:15 - know best what your game should be like
07:17 - you know with the idea that you have in
07:19 - your head and what you're actually
07:20 - trying to accomplish so always keep that
07:22 - in mind make sure you don't Implement
07:23 - every single idea that you get if you do
07:25 - then the final game won't just be a
07:27 - mishmash of different ideas that might
07:28 - not go together in the end it's really
07:30 - up to you as the developer to figure out
07:32 - which ideas to take and which ones you
07:33 - should ignore more okay so focus on
07:36 - gameplay and have people test it so you
07:39 - can refine it right and while you do the
07:41 - play testing you're also getting
07:43 - networking contacts for future tests and
07:45 - potential buyers once the game is
07:48 - finished so in general play testing
07:50 - really good asking more than just your
07:52 - friends and family to play test your
07:54 - game that is extremely good but
07:55 - obviously the big problem is where do
07:57 - you find those people and that can be
07:58 - quite a bit tricky you can perhaps look
08:01 - into Reddit there are some communities
08:02 - that might play your game there are some
08:04 - discords with lots of developers who
08:05 - play each other games you might look
08:07 - into itch.io there might be some forms
08:09 - and some areas over there to find the
08:11 - community or alternatively you can kind
08:12 - of do what I've done which is make a
08:14 - YouTube channel grow that YouTube
08:16 - channel over time with whatever game
08:17 - that related videos you have like
08:19 - perhaps devlogs or something like that
08:20 - and then you have an audience that if
08:22 - you ask them to test your game they
08:23 - might be able to do that so plenty of
08:25 - options to find plate testers other than
08:28 - just your friends and family
08:31 - okay I remember this I was crunching
08:33 - trying to get all the features but
08:34 - together it kept breaking every time I
08:37 - added something yeah this this plugin
08:40 - won't work it says it works for
08:41 - massively multiplayer RPG action
08:44 - adventure racing open world VR games
08:45 - okay maybe I added one too many features
08:48 - yes scope creep is yet another beginner
08:50 - Game Dev mistake I myself I'm definitely
08:53 - not immune to that when I started making
08:55 - Flash games around my third Flash game I
08:57 - suddenly had the brilliant idea why
08:58 - don't I make a massive MMO game it was
09:01 - meant to be something with like cops and
09:02 - robbers so it was going to have dozens
09:05 - or hundreds of people on the same map
09:06 - some people would try to rub some bangs
09:08 - others would try to stop them obviously
09:10 - after working on that project for a
09:12 - bunch of months it didn't go anywhere so
09:13 - I ended up abandoning it but yeah this
09:15 - is definitely a big problem and you
09:17 - should definitely keep track of it make
09:18 - sure you don't go way too overboard but
09:20 - at the same time if it does happen don't
09:22 - get too down on yourself it seems like
09:23 - this happens to literally everyone
09:26 - foreign
09:27 - making games is sometimes like the Wild
09:29 - Wild West a free open world of
09:32 - opportunity and that freedom can be a
09:35 - big problem yeah freedom is definitely
09:37 - both a positive and negative it's great
09:39 - to be able to do anything I mean it's
09:40 - your game so you can literally add
09:42 - anything you want onto that game but at
09:44 - the same time not having any constraints
09:45 - means you might get caught up trying to
09:47 - add things more and more and more and
09:49 - you never actually end up finishing
09:50 - anything it is indeed a double-edged
09:52 - sword so always be very careful when you
09:54 - add a new mechanic when you come up with
09:55 - a new idea always think to yourself okay
09:57 - this is actually enhancy core idea that
09:59 - I already have if so then perhaps that
10:02 - might be a good addition if not if it's
10:03 - just something you added just because on
10:05 - a whim you suddenly decide to add some
10:07 - more mechanics if so then perhaps it
10:09 - might be wise to keep that on a drawer
10:10 - put that underneath to play around with
10:12 - in the future in case you have time but
10:14 - for now focus on actually finishing the
10:16 - core game idea that you have we all love
10:18 - games and it might be why you started
10:19 - making games all together and sometimes
10:22 - you might want to add every single
10:23 - feature from every favorite game you've
10:25 - ever played so when you're feeling the
10:27 - urge to add a new gameplay feature ask
10:29 - yourself does it fit my existing design
10:32 - if you answered no then focus on getting
10:34 - what you have to a point where you can
10:36 - add new features and if you want to add
10:38 - something anyway
10:39 - prototype it and play test it yep
10:42 - definitely great tip great advice if
10:45 - you're going to add some brand new
10:46 - mechanic to your game especially if it's
10:48 - something complex that is going to take
10:49 - quite a bit of effort perhaps try making
10:51 - just a prototype of that initial idea
10:52 - just get the basics up and running in
10:54 - order to actually test does this idea
10:55 - actually work only it actually improve
10:58 - the final game so remember that when it
11:00 - comes to prototyping you can prototype
11:02 - not just the actual full game idea but
11:04 - individual systems you can always get
11:06 - just the core of it working just enough
11:08 - in order to figure out does this work on
11:09 - the sexual improve the game
11:12 - it brings me to one final piece of
11:14 - advice while you don't want to introduce
11:16 - too many new features don't be afraid to
11:19 - borrow from some of your favorite games
11:21 - yeah definitely I mean if you got into
11:23 - game development chances are you got
11:24 - into it because you actually enjoy
11:26 - playing games so therefore look into the
11:28 - games that you play the things that you
11:29 - enjoy trying to analyze them trying to
11:31 - look at them with a game designer eye
11:33 - and try to see why do those features
11:35 - work why those systems work what makes
11:37 - them so compelling that is one great way
11:39 - you can improve your game play similar
11:41 - games and don't just necessarily copy
11:43 - things just copy paste but actually
11:45 - figure out why those Mechanics Work why
11:47 - those systems work and perhaps they
11:49 - might be applicable to your game in some
11:50 - way you likely got into game development
11:53 - because of the games that inspired you
11:54 - to do so and sometimes listening to the
11:57 - inspiration and keep you going with it
11:59 - going it's hard if you find yourself
12:01 - losing motivation check out this video
12:04 - to learn how to deal with burnout
12:05 - alright that was a great video lots of
12:08 - really interesting tips definitely
12:09 - mistakes that many people might have
12:11 - fallen for so if you're a beginner and
12:13 - you're watching this definitely keep in
12:14 - mind all these mistakes make sure you
12:16 - don't do them and they won't really help
12:17 - you on your Game Dev Journey alright so
12:19 - go ahead and watch the original video
12:20 - And subscribe to stay at home Dev I hope
12:22 - you found this interesting thanks for
12:23 - watching and I'll see you next time
12:36 - thank you
