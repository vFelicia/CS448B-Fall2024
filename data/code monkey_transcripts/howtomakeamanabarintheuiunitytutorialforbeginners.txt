00:00 - hello and welcome I am your code monkey
00:01 - in this video we're going to make a mana
00:03 - bar in the UI let's begin
00:08 - so this is a bar we want to create a
00:10 - simple manner bar with the logic to
00:12 - regenerate and the ability to be able to
00:14 - spend mana so I can spend and the bar
00:17 - regenerates as you can see the texture
00:19 - is nicely animated it has a custom
00:21 - border and when it goes up you can see
00:24 - that it has a nice edge image and it
00:26 - vanishes in yet all right so let's get
00:29 - to it so here we are in an empty scene
00:32 - let's go into the canvas to create our
00:34 - bar so first we create an empty game
00:36 - object this will be our container inside
00:41 - let's have an image for our background
00:47 - okay it's expanded to occupy the home
00:50 - bar size
00:50 - all right now a game object for our bar
00:53 - and let's do this in blue all right like
00:57 - that now in here I'm going to drag a
01:00 - sprite for this one by one white pixel
01:02 - it literally is a texture just say one
01:05 - by one white pixel now we are adding
01:07 - this so we can now go into our bar and
01:10 - now we have access to the various image
01:11 - size so we can swap this from simple and
01:13 - select filmed and here set it to
01:16 - horizontal and go from the left alright
01:19 - so right now we have an extremely simple
01:21 - and easy to use bar we just change the
01:23 - film mountain here so as you can see
01:25 - when it is at one it's completely foam
01:27 - when it's at zero it's a little empty
01:29 - and somewhere in between so this is the
01:32 - only value we need to change through our
01:33 - code and finally just add a border and
01:43 - there it is our extremely simple bar all
01:46 - right so now with the UI setup complete
01:48 - let's head into the code make a new
01:51 - c-sharp script this will be the handler
01:52 - for our mana bar so in here let's first
01:56 - go on to our private void awake to grab
01:58 - a reference to our bar image
02:05 - all right we have a reference to our bar
02:08 - image and the way we're going to modify
02:11 - this is simply go and change the fill
02:13 - amount
02:14 - so for example in here and let's put it
02:15 - at point three just to test so here in
02:19 - the editor all we need is to drag our
02:21 - script and run the code and yep there
02:23 - you go as you can see the bar is
02:24 - currently 30% film alright great so now
02:28 - back in the code this is supposed to be
02:30 - a kind of mana bar so let's write some
02:32 - basic mana code where the main amount is
02:34 - constantly increasing so for that let's
02:37 - put the mana logic in a different class
02:39 - separate from the bar so here I make the
02:42 - photo class for our mana we need a field
02:45 - for the current man amount we also need
02:50 - a field for the region amount and let's
02:55 - also define a constant for the total
02:59 - alright now in here make a simple
03:02 - constructor and we just initialize that
03:07 - amount to zero and the mana regen amount
03:11 - let's say 30 yet so we're going to regen
03:14 - in 3 mana per second now let's make a
03:17 - function that won't run on update so we
03:20 - can simply call it update and in here
03:25 - we're just going to increase the minimum
03:26 - so we just do man amount was equals the
03:30 - mana regen amount multiplied by
03:33 - time.deltatime
03:38 - all right so just like that we are
03:40 - increasing the mana amount then we need
03:43 - a function to be able to spend some
03:44 - manner and we're just going to spend it
03:49 - if we do have enough
03:57 - okay and finally a function to get back
04:00 - a normalized value and here only do is
04:07 - return the MANET amount divided by the
04:09 - manner max all right so that's about it
04:13 - we have a very simple class to handle
04:15 - all the logic for our manner so now
04:18 - let's use this to test our metal bar so
04:21 - in a week let's create a manner object
04:25 - and here since this one is mono behavior
04:29 - in is attached to script it does indeed
04:30 - have a private oi update and now inside
04:33 - this update we have to call the manner
04:35 - update again we're doing it separately
04:38 - so we keep the logic in one class and
04:41 - dividual in another so this man class
04:44 - does not depend on this mana bar class
04:47 - and after we update the mana we simply
04:50 - go into our bar image and set the fill
04:52 - amount to manage get man at normalize
04:55 - all right so let's test there's the bar
04:58 - and as you can see it is indeed
05:00 - increasing on every frame all right so
05:02 - far so good now let's add a button to
05:05 - test spending our mana so for that here
05:08 - we are in the mana bar and I'm going to
05:10 - be using the code monkey utilities which
05:12 - as always you can grab for free from
05:14 - unity code monkey calm so from those I
05:17 - can go into the ECM debug class to
05:19 - create just a very simple button on the
05:21 - you are alright so this function takes a
05:31 - position for the button a text for the
05:32 - button and then an action and this
05:34 - action is triggered when we click on the
05:36 - button and when we click we want to try
05:38 - to spend some man
05:39 - alright so let's test okay here we are
05:42 - the man is increasing there's the
05:44 - testing button now if I click on it I
05:46 - clicked and as you can see nothing
05:49 - actually happened so let's go into our
05:51 - mana class to see why that is happening
05:53 - and the reason is actually pretty simple
05:55 - it's that in here on our updates we are
05:57 - increasing the met amount but we are not
05:59 - actually capping it so we are currently
06:01 - on letting man amount go way beyond mana
06:03 - max so when we spend we don't actually
06:05 - see it so in here all we need to do
06:13 - here all we do is climb our man amount
06:16 - all right so let's try again
06:19 - there's the bar it's filling up when
06:21 - it's the moon leaf oh and I click on
06:23 - spin Manor yep there you go now it
06:24 - correctly spent 30 men so I can spend
06:27 - several times when I get down there I
06:29 - can only spend any more since I need to
06:31 - have a minimum ok great so our extremely
06:34 - simple bar is pretty much done
06:36 - however this looks pretty boring so
06:39 - let's polish it up to make it look quite
06:40 - a lot better so here in the project
06:43 - files I have a bunch of interesting
06:44 - assets like for example in here our mana
06:47 - bar let's replace the bar with our mana
06:50 - bar and put everything in white ok right
06:52 - for the border let's replace with our
06:55 - mana border for a tea color in white
06:59 - now this border is meant to go on top so
07:01 - let's drag it to be on top of our bar
07:03 - okay there's our border now in here on
07:12 - the border in this case it is pretty
07:14 - much scale to correctly match our bar
07:16 - however in order to make it take the
07:19 - exact perfect proportions we can go into
07:21 - our sprite editor and here we can define
07:24 - various slices to be able to easily
07:25 - stretch our bar so we simply drag the
07:27 - top on to there drag the bottom in there
07:31 - and drag the side in there and design in
07:34 - there so this way our sprite will be
07:37 - automatically stretched in the middle
07:39 - bits but the corners won't stay exactly
07:41 - the same so it's a part on the board
07:44 - instead of being simple we simply sound
07:45 - like sliced and just like that you can
07:48 - see that the curves are much more
07:49 - correct
07:50 - now let's scale this alright so there's
07:53 - our border using proper textures which
07:55 - makes it look that much better so let's
07:57 - run this matter bar and even there it is
08:00 - it looks so much better and yep it is
08:02 - increasing so in the same and we can
08:04 - still spend everything so works the same
08:06 - right great
08:06 - now however this is still a bit too
08:09 - simple we want our texture to be
08:11 - animated so let's do that so in order to
08:14 - animate our texture instead of using an
08:16 - image let's remove this
08:18 - and we're going to instead use a raw
08:20 - image now let's drag our mana bar and
08:23 - well using a raw image we have access to
08:27 - more texture options so in here we are
08:29 - using a sprite but we could also have
08:31 - used a simple texture TD also with raw
08:34 - image we could apply a material and do
08:36 - some really interesting shader effects
08:38 - but for now let's simply do a very
08:41 - simple effect which is we want to
08:43 - constantly in here on our UV rect we
08:46 - want to constantly shift the X so that
08:49 - it seems like the bubbles are moving now
08:51 - as you can see once I move that that
08:53 - looks pretty bad and the reason is
08:55 - because we have to go into the meta bar
08:57 - and here on the wrap mode instead of
08:59 - being clamped it needs to be repeat and
09:01 - just like that everything repeats so now
09:03 - in here I can shift the UV rect and
09:06 - there you go the texture is consistently
09:08 - repeating ok so now let's do this
09:11 - movement through code so back in our
09:14 - code the first thing we do is comment
09:16 - out the bar image since that no longer
09:18 - exists instead we have a raw image and
09:27 - here on update instead of setting a fill
09:30 - amount we need to modify the UV rect
09:41 - alright that you do it so we grab the UV
09:44 - right stroke that is currently on the
09:46 - wrong image we shift the X to the left
09:49 - side by one per second and then we
09:52 - simply set the UV rect back into our raw
09:54 - image so let's see if the texture is
09:56 - consistently moving and if there it is
09:59 - the image is indeed being animated now
10:01 - it's moving a bit too fast but yep the
10:04 - effect is examined like this so now we
10:06 - still need to show the current map
10:08 - amount right now it's just fully filled
10:11 - since we can't use a fill amount with a
10:13 - raw image we need to use a different
10:15 - approach so in here we're going to use a
10:18 - mask
10:31 - so here is our mask we sim will create
10:34 - the new game object at the mask and the
10:36 - image component and made our bar a child
10:39 - of the mask so here as you can see the
10:42 - white part is the mask and if we shift
10:43 - the bar on this side as you can see it
10:45 - is no longer visible now in order to be
10:48 - able to move the mask let's stop using
10:50 - stretch and use just a regular width and
10:53 - height same thing for the inner bar and
10:56 - we also set the bar to be anchored on
10:58 - the left side so through code noir to
11:01 - achieve our effect we need to go into
11:03 - our bar mask and here is our width and
11:05 - we can simply change this and the
11:08 - texture behind it won't be animated as
11:10 - we were doing previously so we need is
11:13 - to modify the anchor to the left side
11:15 - and everything should work there it is
11:18 - there's the width going down okay
11:20 - so let's create this effect through our
11:22 - code first let's update the position of
11:25 - our raw image which is not like this or
11:28 - rather fine
11:28 - the bar mask and it's inside the bar
11:32 - mask okay and we also get a private
11:35 - right transform for a bar mask now in
11:43 - here on the update we are still
11:46 - animating the raw image okay that
11:48 - remains the same so we are doing the
11:58 - same thing we're doing previously we get
11:59 - the bar mass size Delta then we get the
12:01 - bar mana normalize and then we need to
12:05 - multiply that by the mask width so let's
12:08 - store it up here and we grab it from the
12:14 - rect transform size Delta X okay this
12:18 - way we don't have to write any magic
12:20 - numbers in our code so you do that and
12:22 - then just get the mana normalized
12:24 - multiplied by the width and finally we
12:28 - set the size Delta back to our modified
12:30 - bar master science No
12:32 - all right that's pretty much it let's
12:34 - see and yet there it is as you can see
12:36 - it is increasing in the texture behind
12:38 - the distant animated so we can spend
12:39 - some manner
12:40 - and there you go the madam bar goes down
12:42 - the texture remains animated and
12:44 - everything looks much better than simple
12:46 - solid colors and here the direction of
12:48 - the effect is very much personal
12:50 - preference since we can simply go into
12:51 - our code and swap from minus equals
12:54 - point to do plus equals and all of a
12:57 - sudden the texture direction is going in
12:59 - the opposite direction and there you go
13:02 - so now let's add one final effect we're
13:05 - going to add the glow on the edge of the
13:06 - bar so we're here in the project files I
13:09 - have these glow images alright so this
13:19 - is our edge image now let's change the
13:23 - position of this the same way we were
13:25 - changing the mask width so here in the
13:28 - code let's grab the edge rect transform
13:35 - and on update we're going to do pretty
13:39 - much the same thing we set the rect
13:41 - transform anchored position and the X
13:45 - will be the same as the bar mask width
13:48 - so we copy this and then put it on zero
13:50 - all right so it should pretty much be
13:52 - working let's see and if there it is
13:55 - there's the edge image accompanying as
13:57 - the mark gets filmed all right now the
13:59 - ad should be hidden if the bar is fully
14:01 - complete so let's do that so in here we
14:03 - can simply do that that came object set
14:06 - active and this one is only visible if
14:09 - the mana dot get mana normalized
14:12 - is under one so if the bar is not come
14:16 - loaded filmed it should be visible let's
14:18 - see and there it is the edge is visible
14:20 - once it gets to the end there you go it
14:22 - vanishes now I spent some mana there's
14:24 - the edge again goes up and vanishes all
14:27 - right great
14:28 - now let's add the final effect which is
14:30 - to make the edge animated
15:11 - all right so here is a simple animation
15:13 - we just had the two individual edge
15:15 - images and I'm here I just have a simple
15:18 - animation changing the Alpha and moving
15:21 - it a bit and here in the edge it has an
15:23 - animation component with that animation
15:25 - okay so let's see and yet there it is
15:28 - the final effect with a nice animation
15:30 - going up and when it gets to completely
15:32 - fall it hides itself so I can spend some
15:35 - mana and there it is the mana bar is
15:37 - filling out gets filled and come only
15:39 - empty and just like that I cannot spend
15:42 - if I don't have enough and yep it's
15:45 - regenerating and so on and so forth so
15:47 - there you have it you create a mana bar
15:49 - that displays a current mana amount that
15:51 - we can spend and regenerates over time
15:53 - we have the nice animation to the bar as
15:55 - well as it going on the edge making it
15:56 - one look very nice as always you can
15:58 - download the project files any tony's
16:00 - from unity code monkey comm if you have
16:02 - any questions post them in the comments
16:03 - and I'll do my best Internet subscribe
16:05 - for more videos and I'll see you next
16:06 - time
