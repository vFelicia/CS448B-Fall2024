00:02 - hello and welcome I am your code monkey
00:04 - and as you may know I am an indie game
00:06 - developer and I've just launched my own
00:07 - latest game on Steam so I will now play
00:10 - the short trailer and then talk about
00:11 - what's coming on the channel
00:27 - [Music]
00:56 - [Music]
01:09 - [Music]
01:17 - so that's a game from a programming
01:20 - standpoint this is without a doubt the
01:21 - most complex game I have ever made there
01:23 - are a lot of real interesting systems
01:25 - all working together but with the
01:26 - underlying code nicely separated as a
01:29 - bonus to the viewers of this channel I
01:30 - have further reduced the price on the
01:32 - bundle of all my games to just 5 bucks
01:33 - so you can get on those games and then
01:36 - go to steam to pick up battle royale
01:38 - Tycoon through the steam bundle page
01:39 - which will add an extra 30% off to the
01:42 - normal price if you're following this
01:44 - channel that I'm guessing you're
01:45 - interested in making games and I think
01:47 - it's very useful to view how what I'm
01:48 - teaching in these videos is applicable
01:50 - to a real final product if you do pick
01:53 - up the game feel free to ask about how
01:54 - any particular system was made going
01:57 - forward that won't be back to making
01:58 - videos there are a lot that I have
02:00 - queued up and now that the game is out
02:02 - there are some systems in the game that
02:03 - I wouldn't like to do a video on the
02:05 - first one I'm planning is covering on
02:06 - how the guest sprites are created as you
02:08 - can see they are randomly generated
02:10 - which has a lot of variety to the game
02:11 - this involves some interesting code
02:13 - where you manipulate the texture to
02:15 - create a random final spreadsheet beyond
02:17 - that I want to start tackling the videos
02:19 - that have the most votes on these
02:21 - suggestions so that's the plan I hope
02:24 - you like the game and I'll see you next
02:25 - time
