00:23 - you're most interested in and i might do
00:25 - a detailed review on it as always
00:26 - there's links to the ads in the
00:27 - description and as a bonus you can use

00:37 - that i've never been discounted
00:38 - previously if you've been watching these
00:40 - asset highlight videos for the past
00:42 - couple of months and adding some things
00:43 - to your wish list chances are some of
00:45 - those are now discount and there's also
00:47 - a bunch of interesting humble bundles
00:48 - for game devs there's one with a bunch
00:50 - of courses for learning blender 3d
00:52 - modeling i'm currently going through
00:54 - these myself learning the basics
00:56 - then there's another one with tons of ui
00:58 - elements lots of sliders buttons and so
01:00 - on another one with lots of music and a
01:03 - final one with tons of sound effects
01:05 - check them all out with the links in the
01:06 - description alright so starting off with
01:08 - an interesting tool if you need some
01:10 - fluffy furry characters
01:12 - very very impressive results visually it
01:15 - looks really unique and it works on both
01:17 - desktop and mobile
01:19 - it works with any shader and your fur
01:21 - can even be slightly transparent and
01:23 - there are no zed sorting issues you can
01:25 - groom the hair in any way you want
01:27 - either with individual layers or by
01:29 - clumping them together it also supports
01:31 - olympic rooms although i have no idea
01:33 - what that means
01:34 - so if your game has some furry
01:36 - characters or maybe just some armor with
01:38 - a bunch of fur then maybe this asset can
01:40 - help add a nice bit of polish to your
01:42 - game and up next here's a really awesome
01:44 - one that i'm surprised i've never seen
01:46 - before it's called 27 slicer which is
01:49 - the same thing as a normal sprite 9
01:50 - slicer but applied to 3d if you don't
01:53 - know what is 9 slicing that is how you
01:55 - can set up your sprites in the sprite
01:57 - editor and you set it up with 9 slices
01:59 - and it automatically resizes the sprite
02:01 - to any shape and all of the corners keep
02:03 - their aspect ratio meaning that the
02:05 - sprite is never stretched in the corner
02:07 - only in the middle so it always looks
02:08 - great
02:09 - this one does exactly that but apply to
02:12 - 3d like i said a really interesting tool
02:14 - and i'm surprised this is the first time
02:15 - i'm hearing of it sounds like it would
02:17 - be extremely useful i guess maybe the
02:19 - only issue is that it's limited to
02:21 - things where this sort of resizing makes
02:22 - sense
02:23 - so it's perfect for couches tables rugs
02:26 - doors windows
02:27 - and of course it probably only looks
02:29 - good within low poly art style i
02:31 - definitely would like to try this one
02:32 - out to see how the setup works i can
02:34 - definitely see this as being extremely
02:36 - useful especially like i said if you
02:37 - have a low poly style game then if you
02:39 - want to add split screen to your games
02:41 - here's a nice tool it works perfectly
02:44 - the transition from double camera to
02:46 - single camera is really seamless
02:48 - naturally this is perfect for split
02:50 - screen multiplayer but could also work
02:52 - for a single player game where you
02:53 - control multiple units the split is
02:56 - created automatically and rotates around
02:58 - based on the camera angle
02:59 - and one of the issues with double
03:01 - cameras is of course double the
03:02 - rendering so thankfully this one also
03:04 - has a feature for automatic non-sampling
03:06 - in order to make it really performant
03:08 - even on low end devices and up next
03:10 - another super useful tool this one for
03:12 - 2d it lets you dynamically create shapes
03:15 - directly inside of unity so you place
03:18 - down some points and some curves to make
03:19 - any shape that you want
03:21 - then easily with one click you can
03:23 - generate the mesh with as much or as
03:25 - little fidelity as you need you can tint
03:27 - it with any solid color or even use a
03:29 - texture it includes an easy to use uv
03:32 - editor so you can make it look exactly
03:34 - as you want or you can even tint it with
03:36 - a gradient without having to manually
03:38 - make it texture in the end you can
03:40 - either use the mesh or convert it into a
03:42 - simple image quite a nice tool that i
03:44 - can see with tons of possible use cases
03:46 - then if you're like me and you don't
03:48 - like the process of populating a level
03:50 - then maybe this tool might help it's a
03:52 - tool to help with level building like so
03:54 - many others but what it does differently
03:56 - is it automatically finds prefabs that
03:58 - relate to whatever you currently have
04:00 - selected so if you select the tree it
04:02 - shows you all of the various trees for
04:04 - me that's always the issue i just end up
04:06 - copy pasting pretty much the same asset
04:08 - over and over again because it's really
04:09 - annoying to constantly keep finding new
04:11 - ones but with this one apparently that
04:13 - process becomes really easy
04:15 - it's got a custom inspector with a
04:17 - search function there's the ability to
04:19 - attend objects for finding them easily
04:21 - and there's even a connection to the
04:22 - asset store to help you find even
04:24 - similar assets then for another 2d tool
04:26 - here you have some digable terrain
04:29 - perfect for any side-scrolling game
04:31 - where you want to enable the player to
04:32 - build out their level so maybe a mining
04:34 - game kind of like terraria or seymour
04:37 - dig or maybe even something like worms
04:39 - you set up the terrain shape using the
04:41 - sprites you want for the film texture
04:43 - and the various edges
04:44 - then the player can easily dig in that
04:46 - area includes 9 different terrain types
04:48 - and a nice cartoony art sound then
04:50 - here's a very unique tool a transform
04:53 - changes debugger this one is meant to
04:55 - help you debug your transforms when
04:57 - they're acting weird it essentially
04:59 - hooks into all of the transform
05:01 - functions and keeps track of how it
05:03 - changed and from where those changes
05:04 - came from it's also a visual tool in
05:06 - order to make it very easy to visually
05:08 - see on all of the frames which had more
05:10 - actions than usual so at a glance you
05:12 - can probably find the issue right away
05:14 - just by seeing which frame had more
05:16 - action than it's supposed to
05:18 - this one is really a problem that i've
05:19 - never really encountered myself but if
05:21 - this happens to you then i can see this
05:23 - as being quite useful and up next if you
05:25 - have some blurry textures and no access
05:28 - to the originals or you just don't have
05:30 - it in high resolution then here's an ai
05:32 - powered resizer it does exactly what you
05:34 - expect takes your blurry low-res
05:37 - textures and upscales it using ai
05:39 - the screenshots on the store page look
05:41 - very impressive complex images and all
05:43 - of the detail is preserved in the hi-res
05:45 - version it lets you batch generate and
05:48 - override the original so with just one
05:50 - button you can instantly fix all of the
05:52 - low rest textures in your game
05:54 - the api can even be used in runtime so
05:56 - maybe if you receive some user images in
05:58 - your game you can use this to uprise
06:00 - them then here's a nice visual tool a
06:02 - stadium crowd generator you can
06:05 - dynamically generate the crowd on the
06:06 - stands use from multiple materials to
06:08 - get it looking like a football stadium
06:10 - or maybe boxing or nascar
06:12 - you control how the onions looks and
06:14 - reacts to the game you can color them
06:16 - and offset the animation to make it all
06:18 - look very natural and it's even
06:20 - optimized with gpu instancing so it's
06:22 - very performant and then if you want to
06:24 - display some gifs in your game here's a
06:26 - nice tool you might be aware that unity
06:28 - has a video player component but that
06:30 - one only works on video files so it
06:32 - cannot play gifs so this has an elms to
06:35 - solve that just one line of code to load
06:37 - any gif that give can also support alpha
06:40 - and it even supports screen recording so
06:42 - if you have some feature in your game
06:44 - kind of like a gamewin screen or some
06:46 - highlights and you want to enable the
06:48 - player to make some gifs to share them
06:49 - on social media then this one makes that
06:51 - process extremely easy it's very simple
06:54 - and does exactly what it's meant to do
06:55 - all right so those are my top 10 new
06:57 - tools and systems on the unity asset
06:59 - store for december 2021 there's links to
