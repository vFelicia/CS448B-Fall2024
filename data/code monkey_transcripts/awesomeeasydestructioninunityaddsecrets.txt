00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:01 - and here let's learn how to make some
00:03 - simple but awesome destruction so we
00:05 - want to have a wall that when we damage
00:07 - it turns into pieces and it falls apart
00:09 - this is a great simple way to add some
00:11 - awesome secrets onto your games we're
00:13 - going to use the third person shooter
00:14 - controller that was made in a previous
00:16 - video in order to shoot at the wall and
00:17 - damage it and then we're going to apply
00:19 - the same destructibility to some crates
00:21 - and any other objects easily design your
00:23 - next game with this video sponsor
00:25 - millinote miller note is an awesome tool
00:27 - for organizing your projects in freeform
00:29 - virtualboards if you've been watching
00:31 - this channel for a while you might have
00:32 - heard me say that i usually tend to
00:33 - design on paper and the reason is
00:35 - because i can write anywhere and draw
00:36 - some images it's a much better format
00:38 - than a basic text document but paper
00:40 - also has its downsides well what melon
00:42 - does is it provides exactly that type of
00:44 - format with tons of features to help you
00:46 - design and organize your ideas so you
00:48 - can place down images text checklists
00:50 - videos organize them in any way you want
00:53 - make some arrows position all the
00:54 - elements in a way that makes sense
00:56 - organize them into multiple boards and
00:57 - tons more you've got as much space as
00:59 - you want to fit any design id you have
01:01 - from very small to some massive games
01:03 - there's also a ton of preset templates
01:05 - for game design characters world
01:07 - building and lots more really great to
01:09 - get you up and running quickly
01:11 - note is really easy to use and they also
01:12 - have a mobile app so you can easily
01:14 - iterate upon your designs even while
01:16 - you're outside there's a completely free
01:18 - plan with no time limit so click the
01:20 - link in the description to try it out
01:21 - and use it for your next project okay so
01:24 - the way we're going to build this is
01:25 - actually quite simple we just make a
01:27 - normal wong then we make some sort of
01:29 - health system for it then we're going to
01:31 - make some wall parts and when the wall
01:33 - takes enough damage then it
01:34 - automatically changes from the wall into
01:36 - the wall parts and using physics we
01:38 - apply some force in order to smash those
01:40 - parts then we just make it work with
01:41 - bullets and everything looks great okay
01:44 - so let's do this now first of all here
01:46 - is my very normal wall
01:48 - so this one and this whole demo scene
01:50 - this is taken from the polygon cinti
01:52 - heist asset pack there's a link
01:54 - description if you want to get it it's a
01:55 - pretty fun pack for making some sort of
01:57 - heist game okay and it's got some really
01:59 - nice walls now over here the first thing
02:01 - that we need is to make some wall parts
02:02 - and for that we're going to need to
02:04 - break the model into various pieces and
02:06 - in order to do that we can use unity pro
02:08 - builder this is a super useful tool for
02:10 - doing 3d modeling directly inside of
02:12 - unity it's also one of the tools that i
02:14 - cover in my ultimate unity overview
02:16 - course so go ahead and get it in order
02:18 - to learn about pro bundler and 40 other
02:20 - tools and features now over here with my
02:22 - wall this is the normal mesh so this one
02:24 - was probably made in blender or some 3d
02:26 - program like that so the first thing i
02:28 - need is to convert it into the pro
02:30 - bundle format so i just go into tools
02:32 - pro builder open up the pro bundle
02:34 - window and over here just select the
02:35 - object and probe build rise okay so now
02:37 - i have a pro bundler mesh with this we
02:40 - can now use all the probe builder tools
02:42 - to work with this object and
02:43 - specifically we can use the programmer
02:45 - tool that i covered in a previous video
02:47 - it lets us make all kinds of actions
02:49 - with propeller meshes specifically we
02:51 - can use it to cut off parts of a mesh
02:53 - so i can just make an empty 3d cube
02:56 - then on this cube just position it
02:58 - roughly like that let's maybe push to
03:00 - the side put it something like that
03:02 - right on the corner there
03:04 - and now by going into tools pro builder
03:06 - and open up the boolean tool
03:08 - now i can drag the first wall and then
03:10 - my cube
03:11 - and get the intersection of both of them
03:13 - apply
03:14 - and yep over here is my nice corner
03:17 - again go watch that other video if you
03:19 - haven't seen how to use this boolean
03:20 - tool this is a super useful tool that is
03:23 - actually surprisingly hidden okay so now
03:25 - all it takes is do the same thing so
03:27 - just move this into a different position
03:28 - rotate it differently and cut it up
03:30 - again and so on to get all the various
03:32 - parts now over here i have a wall where
03:34 - i did exactly that so i just went
03:35 - through and cut up all kinds of pieces
03:37 - from the wall so i just did that same
03:39 - process over and over again slicing
03:41 - everything into a nice bit of randomness
03:43 - okay so with that now over here i've got
03:45 - two objects so i've got the normal wall
03:47 - and then the wall broken apart now the
03:49 - one that is broken apart is made up of
03:51 - multiple objects so you can see inside
03:53 - this prefab there's all the individual
03:55 - parts and now the one thing that is very
03:57 - important is to make sure that the pivot
03:59 - is always exactly on the same position
04:01 - so over there on the wall the pivot is
04:02 - over there on that corner and for the
04:04 - wall broken it is also on that corner
04:06 - the wall broken will be placed exactly
04:08 - on the same position as the original one
04:10 - so that's why they need to match okay so
04:12 - now here just make sure that i add a
04:14 - collider and a rigid body so first a
04:16 - mesh can leather into one of these parts
04:18 - make it convex and then also add a rigid
04:22 - body so just like this let's see if all
04:24 - the meshes do have proper collisions
04:26 - and if there's the wall and yep they do
04:28 - have proper collisions and on the
04:30 - third-person interior that i made that
04:31 - already applies them for so if i shoot
04:33 - if i can destroy this whole wall alright
04:36 - so far so good by the way if you find
04:38 - the video helpful please hit the like
04:40 - button it's a tiny thing but it really
04:41 - does help thanks so we have all the
04:43 - assets that we need now let's end the
04:45 - logic for how to use them like i said
04:47 - we're going to make the wall damage
04:48 - among but i don't want the wall to be
04:50 - destroyed with a single hit so let's
04:52 - make the wall have a proper health
04:53 - system and the first thing we need is
04:55 - just a script so in uc sharp script
04:57 - called destructible wall
05:00 - then on the normal wall object let's
05:02 - just attach a script onto it okay now
05:04 - let's open
05:05 - so like i said we're going to need a
05:07 - health system for our wall
05:09 - and as a great thing over here i'm going
05:10 - to reuse the health system that i've
05:12 - made a really long time ago so this was
05:14 - actually made in the very first video on
05:16 - this channel
05:18 - so just private health system make it of
05:20 - type health system
05:22 - and on private void awake just create it
05:27 - there you go again this class was made
05:29 - on the very first video on this channel
05:30 - over three years ago so this is an
05:32 - excellent example of how you should
05:34 - build nice clean classes that you can
05:36 - then reuse and save some time many years
05:38 - in the future okay so with this we've
05:40 - got a health system now for dealing some
05:42 - damage over here i have the third person
05:44 - shooter controller that was made in a
05:45 - previous video
05:47 - and then down here for detecting hits it
05:49 - uses a raycast so it identifies it sees
05:51 - if it has a rigid body if so it applies
05:53 - explosion so over here we can test if
05:55 - the collider contains some other
05:57 - component now we could write some code
05:59 - here to make it work specifically by
06:01 - testing for the destructible one
06:03 - component but instead let's write some
06:05 - nice clean code so instead of testing
06:07 - specifically for this destructible wall
06:09 - let's make it work with a simple
06:11 - damageable interface
06:12 - so let's just make a new c sharp script
06:14 - call it i damageable
06:17 - and then over here this one is not a
06:18 - class but rather it is an interface
06:21 - and it is not a model behavior
06:24 - if you are not familiar with interfaces
06:26 - i cover them in more detail in another
06:27 - video so go watch that if you want to
06:29 - learn more they are super useful for
06:31 - making your code extremely adaptable
06:33 - now for the functions let's just add a
06:35 - void damage function
06:38 - we're going to receive an end for the
06:39 - damage amount
06:41 - and that's pretty much it that's the
06:42 - only function we need right now so over
06:44 - here when we do the raycast let's do the
06:47 - same thing that i did over here for the
06:48 - rigidbody but instead do it for our
06:50 - interface so for the i damageable
06:53 - interface
06:57 - so just get that interface and then go
06:59 - and simply call the damage function
07:01 - then pass in the damage amount let's say
07:03 - i wanted one to be destroyed in three
07:05 - hits so maybe 33.
07:07 - okay so now the third person shooter
07:09 - should already be dealing damage to
07:10 - objects with eye damageable so now we
07:12 - need to do is go into our destructible
07:14 - wall and over here we extend mono
07:16 - behavior then we implement our interface
07:18 - and let's implement it
07:20 - and over here on the damage just go into
07:22 - the health system in order to cause some
07:24 - damage
07:26 - so just deal damage passing the damage
07:28 - amount
07:29 - and now this health system actually has
07:31 - a bunch of really nice events
07:33 - specifically it's got an event when it
07:34 - dies so we can subscribe to that so the
07:37 - health system
07:38 - subscribe to the undead event
07:42 - and when the undead event happens
07:44 - then let's just destroy this object this
07:47 - game object and just do a debug
07:51 - okay so just like this let's test and
07:52 - see if we can damage and destroy the
07:54 - wall
07:55 - alright so here i am and there's the
07:57 - wall one two three four and there you go
07:59 - the wall gets destroyed all right
08:01 - awesome so now we just combine this with
08:04 - our wall parts so on the one script
08:06 - let's set a reference to our prefab
08:12 - and then when we destroy and let's call
08:13 - instantiate
08:15 - we're going to instantiate the broken
08:17 - wall prefab
08:18 - instantiate on this transform position
08:20 - and this transform rotation
08:22 - okay so let's test so here i am let's
08:25 - aim and shoot
08:27 - and there you go it does destroy the
08:28 - wall and the spawn d1 parts all right
08:31 - awesome and again just like this like we
08:33 - saw previously since the bullets are
08:34 - automatically causing some force onto
08:37 - all these objects i can already this
08:39 - right along so it already looks pretty
08:41 - great but we do want the wall to fall
08:43 - apart pretty much automatically as soon
08:45 - as it's spawned and we also want to hide
08:47 - that transition with some vfx so let's
08:49 - do that
08:50 - okay so for the explosion force
08:52 - after we spawn the walls we want to
08:55 - apply some explosion force now for that
08:57 - that means that we need to know the
08:58 - position of the explosion so let's pass
09:01 - it in on our damage function
09:03 - so let's modify our interface to receive
09:05 - the damage amount
09:06 - and also a vector three for the damage
09:09 - position
09:12 - over here let's do it factor three for
09:14 - the damage position
09:17 - and then on the third percent shooter
09:19 - let's trigger with that damage and then
09:21 - the position will be on the raycast hit
09:23 - that point so this is the exact point
09:24 - that we hit okay so with that now let's
09:27 - just store the last damage position
09:31 - okay so we've got the unless damage
09:33 - position then using this we can now
09:35 - apply some force
09:39 - now to apply the force we need a
09:41 - reference to some rigid body so let's
09:43 - cycle through all the children
09:50 - and then over here we can call add
09:52 - explosion force
09:55 - and we're going to use the last damage
09:57 - position
09:58 - and let's just also spawn some vfx
10:02 - so let's make another one
10:04 - and we're just going to call instantiate
10:06 - spawn of the effects directly on the
10:08 - last damage position
10:11 - okay that's it let's test
10:12 - okay so here i am aim at the wall and
10:15 - shoot and if there you go the wall
10:17 - explodes and boom it falls apart
10:18 - instantly alright so we can play around
10:20 - those valleys a bit more
10:22 - alright so here i am there's the wall
10:24 - aim and shoot boom and there you go all
10:27 - right
10:28 - so the wall gets destroyed now i can go
10:30 - in
10:31 - right awesome so with this we have
10:33 - everything working now again of course
10:35 - this whole thing can be applied to also
10:36 - really just about any object
10:48 - all right so i cut up the crate into
10:50 - various parts
10:51 - so now to make this code more reusable
10:53 - let's rename the class from being
10:55 - destructive along to being destructive
10:57 - on something
10:58 - so maybe just destructible object make
11:00 - this work with anything
11:03 - and again since the shooter code already
11:05 - works with the eye dimensional interface
11:07 - then we don't need to modify that one
11:09 - because it doesn't deal directly with
11:11 - this object
11:12 - now i can also expose the health amount
11:19 - and also expose a float for the
11:20 - explosion force
11:22 - and then just need to attach the object
11:25 - so there you go actually create broken
11:28 - the same vfx
11:29 - the health amount max let's say i want
11:31 - this one to be destroyed in just one hit
11:33 - so let's switch is 30
11:35 - and explosion force yeah maybe 200 let's
11:37 - see
11:38 - all right so here there's a nice crate
11:40 - and as soon as i shoot it boom it
11:42 - explodes and goes into all body parts
11:44 - and the wall as well boom explodes all
11:46 - gone alright awesome
11:52 - all right so here with a whole bunch of
11:54 - crates on the wall and as soon as i
11:55 - destroyed boom they all fly they all
11:57 - explode they don't get destroyed lots of
11:59 - particles everything flying everywhere
12:01 - all right awesome
12:03 - so you can see how you can use this to
12:05 - add just a bit more life to your games
12:07 - and make some descriptive rolls in order
12:09 - to hide some secrets
12:10 - or really just add a whole bunch of
12:12 - description here to make your whole
12:13 - level feel much more alive also don't
12:15 - forget to check out melo note with the
12:16 - link in the description it's free so
12:18 - check it out and try using it in your
12:20 - next project alright hope that's useful
12:22 - check out these videos to learn some
12:24 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
12:26 - supporters for making these videos
