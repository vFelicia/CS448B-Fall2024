00:04 - update to my ultimate TNT overview
00:05 - course it adds 8 more lectures covering
00:07 - more tools and features for a total of
00:09 - over 16 lectures this one is a commonly
00:11 - free update so if you're already on the

00:14 - new lectures and if you don't own the
00:16 - course yet you can get it to the link in
00:17 - the description with a coupon for 75 off
00:19 - this update adds in lecture on remote
00:21 - config this is Unity soul for how you
00:24 - can Define films in your game and then
00:25 - easily modify them without having to
00:27 - upload a brand new build so this one is
00:29 - great for iteration related to that one
00:31 - is game overrides with this one you can
00:33 - Target specific types of players and
00:35 - give them different values depending on
00:37 - your targets and then do some a b
00:39 - testing to analyze the results and see
00:41 - which value works best for your game
00:43 - another lecture is on cloud save this is
00:45 - how you can store player data in the
00:47 - cloud the obvious use case for this one
00:49 - is save files but you can save whatever
00:50 - that you want if you want to implement a
00:52 - persistent authentication system then
00:54 - this also becomes cross-platform and
00:56 - then I also added lectures for some
00:58 - tools that I've also covered on this
00:59 - channel this course is meant to work as
01:01 - a sort of Library reference which is why
01:03 - I encourage people to watch the lectures
01:04 - that they're most interested in but then
01:06 - also watch all of the other ones because
01:08 - there are plenty of tools that you might
01:09 - not even know exist so I had the lecture
01:11 - on netcode for game objects this is
01:13 - unity's official multiplayer netcode
01:15 - solution then lobby with this one you
01:17 - can group players together next is an
01:19 - electron relay with this tool you can
01:21 - connect players together without having
01:22 - to worry about opening ports or
01:24 - firewalls after that is in lecture on
01:26 - Game Server hosting this one was great
01:28 - if you want to make your game based on
01:29 - dedicated servers instead of
01:30 - peer-to-peer and in lecture on
01:32 - Matchmaker which is a Unity tool for
01:34 - matching pointers together based on
01:35 - whatever rules you define those are the
01:37 - 8 new lectures added in this free update
