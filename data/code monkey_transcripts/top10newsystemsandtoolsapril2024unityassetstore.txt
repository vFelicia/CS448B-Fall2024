00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your KMI the
00:02 - assessa is full of awesome tools and
00:04 - assets to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - April 24 this one is the list of paid
00:11 - systems and tools in the last video
00:13 - already covered all the best free new
00:15 - assets and next one I'll be covering top
00:17 - visuals and effects as always there's a
00:18 - link to the ass in the description and
00:20 - as a bonus you can use the coupon code
00:21 - monkey 10 to get 10% off your earn also
00:23 - the spring sale on the asset store is
00:25 - still going strong there's a ton of the
00:27 - top assets on sale pretty much all the
00:29 - ones that I covered in my review series
00:30 - are currently discounted so for example
00:32 - I highly recommend field this is an
00:33 - excellent tool for helping you polish
00:35 - your game I can highly recommend the ASR
00:37 - pathfinding project this one is
00:38 - absolutely perfect if you need any kind
00:40 - of extreme pathfinding and make it
00:41 - insanely fast Odin inspector is always
00:43 - great for building tools easy save is
00:45 - great for saving any kind of data and
00:46 - tons of visuals from cyti and all kinds
00:48 - of polishers those are always great to
00:50 - pretty much build any game also remember
00:51 - to check the Flash Deals these are up to
00:53 - 70% off you can see which ones are
00:55 - active right now and you can see which
00:57 - ones are going to be active in the
00:58 - future so definitely browse this page
00:59 - and see if anything you need is going to
01:01 - be on a really deep discount in time in
01:03 - the future and if so then come back to
01:04 - it and make sure you pick it up on the
01:05 - super deep discount also I'm finishing
01:07 - up building the interactive exercises
01:09 - for all of the advanced lectures for my
01:10 - cop course so if you have the premium
01:12 - version stay tuned for that and in case
01:14 - you don't know both the beginner and the
01:15 - intermediate all the video lectures for
01:17 - both those sections those are already
01:18 - available for free over here on YouTube
01:20 - all right so starting off with an
01:21 - interesting prefab asset named blackbox
01:24 - this is a very unique tool for
01:25 - essentially handling prefab
01:27 - encapsulation like name applies it lets
01:29 - you turn a pre preab into a black box
01:31 - meaning it hides the complexity of the
01:32 - prefab when you attach this script onto
01:34 - it I've always said how writing good
01:36 - clean code is all about minimizing
01:37 - complexity and the best way to minimize
01:39 - complexity is simply information hiding
01:41 - meaning you only expose the things that
01:42 - you absolutely want to expose and you
01:44 - make everything else private and this
01:46 - one seems to apply that exact same
01:47 - concept but to prefabs in the editor it
01:49 - limits how much you can see in the
01:51 - prefab object which in turn helps
01:52 - minimize potential Errors By modifying
01:54 - overrides that you really should not
01:56 - have modified and if you do want to
01:58 - expose individual properties like some
01:59 - kind of speed field or the mesh field if
02:01 - so you can expose those individually so
02:03 - those fields are exposed while
02:05 - everything else stays hidden again just
02:07 - like in code how you want to make
02:08 - everything private except for a handful
02:10 - of things you want public so this is
02:11 - really a very unique idea definitely one
02:13 - of the most interesting tools I've seen
02:15 - in months especially if you're working
02:16 - in a team I can imagine this will be
02:18 - really useful for helping avoid all
02:20 - kinds of strange errors next if you'd
02:22 - like to make a city here is a great
02:24 - system to help you out it's called dots
02:26 - traffic City and like n implies it's
02:28 - using dots to make it extremely per
02:29 - performance you can simulate thousands
02:31 - of vehicles and pedestrians even on a
02:33 - mobile device you can Define Crossroads
02:35 - yourself Define how the cars can turn
02:38 - and where exactly can the pedestrians
02:39 - cross you can add some parking space you
02:42 - can add some block lanes check for
02:44 - intersections make some Buzz routes and
02:46 - so on there's really quite a lot of
02:47 - logic involved in this asset with just
02:49 - this you could definitely generate a
02:51 - fully functioning City it also even
02:53 - includes a vehicle controller with
02:54 - controllable physics so you can Define
02:56 - the city and then drive around it if
02:58 - you'd like to make some kind of traffic
03:00 - management game or maybe a buzz
03:01 - transport game like cityz in motion or
03:04 - really if you just need a complex lived
03:06 - in city for some kind of game idea if so
03:08 - then this one would be a great start
03:10 - next if you want to visualize bones then
03:12 - check out bone assistant this is a tool
03:14 - to help you handle bones directly inside
03:16 - of unity one of the main limitations of
03:19 - unity is how you cannot create or edit
03:21 - humanoid animations by default it just
03:23 - doesn't work or rather you can but it's
03:25 - in a very strange way so this haset
03:27 - helps make that much simpler you can
03:29 - first of all just display all the bones
03:31 - and make them visible then you can
03:32 - easily select them with a single click
03:34 - that alone really helps you treat your
03:36 - characters kind of like puppets and then
03:37 - you can either create a humanoid
03:39 - animation from scratch or just edit an
03:41 - existing one so it's a simple tool that
03:43 - is pretty cheap and can be quite useful
03:45 - then on the other hand for a really
03:46 - complex tool here is Noah debugger this
03:49 - is a very complex tool with tons of
03:51 - capabilities it's basically a bunch of
03:53 - tabs with tons of info that you can see
03:55 - directly inside of your games builds
03:57 - meaning you don't just see all the stats
03:59 - in the edor rather in the build itself
04:01 - it's always very important to actually
04:03 - profile your final build as opposed to
04:04 - just profiling the editor like for
04:06 - example usually reading the logs or
04:08 - opening the profiler in a build doing
04:10 - that is actually quite tricky whereas
04:11 - with this you just import the asset into
04:13 - your project and works right away you
04:15 - can see a profiler showing all these
04:16 - stats you can read the console logs you
04:18 - can explore the hierarchy again all this
04:20 - while in a build or just have a tab with
04:22 - some custom info you can do all that or
04:24 - to find some commands that you can then
04:25 - run in your build so this looks like an
04:27 - extremely capable tool made even more
04:29 - use useful by how easy it is to
04:31 - implement you just import and that's it
04:33 - you already have a super useful
04:34 - debugging tools for your builds and of
04:36 - course if you want you can then dive
04:37 - deeper with some custom commands and
04:39 - custom info so if you have issues with
04:41 - your builds if you want to get some more
04:43 - info out of them if so then definitely
04:44 - check this one out next here's a fun
04:46 - simple one it's a tool for displaying 3D
04:49 - objects in your UI actually covered how
04:51 - to do exactly this in a previous
04:53 - tutorial but if you just want a tool
04:55 - that does it and does it very well then
04:56 - this looks really great you just attach
04:58 - the image script then drag a 3D model
05:01 - and that's really it you can now view it
05:02 - in your UI in real time then you can
05:05 - easily modify the camera position the
05:06 - rotation and all of those settings to
05:08 - get the exact view you want and of
05:10 - course since this is actually a view of
05:11 - a 3D object you can animate and move
05:13 - that 3D object in any way you want so
05:15 - this is a great very simple way to make
05:17 - your UI more Dynamic by having a handful
05:20 - of animated 3D elements to make it
05:21 - really stand out or for another fun
05:23 - visual here are some God Rays this is an
05:25 - effect that always massively improves
05:27 - the look of any game adding some
05:29 - volumetric lights although technically
05:30 - this one is actually not volumetric this
05:33 - one is just a post procing effect
05:35 - meaning that the lights actually don't
05:36 - have a shape in the 3D World it just
05:38 - looks that way but based on the video
05:40 - the results are really excellent
05:42 - everything looks really good seeing all
05:43 - the lights passing through all the trees
05:45 - all the clouds and so on this one
05:47 - supports unlimited light so you can
05:49 - really add as many as you want and it
05:51 - works in both 3D and 2D so if you want
05:53 - to massively improve how good your game
05:55 - looks then definitely just get an asset
05:57 - like this one the difference really is
05:58 - night and day next here's an interesting
06:00 - one to let you make meshes but using
06:03 - visual nodes I've heard that blender has
06:05 - a tool kind of like this one and some
06:06 - people quite like it basically it allows
06:08 - you to make some very varied meshes by
06:10 - just modifying some parameters so for
06:12 - example you start with A Primitive kind
06:14 - of like a cube then you apply an array
06:16 - node in order to make it into multiple
06:17 - cubes then a merge node to merg it with
06:19 - the sphere then you can scale move
06:21 - rotate it in any way you want to get
06:23 - some really strange results I can see
06:25 - this being especially useful for making
06:26 - VFX meshes where usually you want some
06:29 - strange shape for your particles to
06:30 - follow doing modeling using logic like
06:32 - this instead of manually modifying
06:34 - shapes that is a really interesting way
06:36 - to do 3D modeling I wonder if this
06:38 - method would be easier for someone like
06:39 - me since I'm a programmer and really not
06:41 - an artist then if you have a VR or ar
06:44 - application where you have some kind of
06:45 - controller input check out this one it
06:47 - helps you smooth out the raw data you
06:49 - get from those devices this one
06:51 - apparently uses a state-of-the-art
06:53 - filtering algorithm it's got a strange
06:55 - name it's apparently called one Euro
06:57 - filter algorithm you can read the paper
06:59 - for the algorith if you want basically
07:00 - this tool can help you smooth out values
07:02 - so you can smooth out floats Vector 2
07:04 - three fours as well asterion so if your
07:07 - VR game is looking a little bit jittery
07:09 - then perhaps a tool like this one can do
07:10 - the trick next up here's a tool that
07:13 - lets you take your inspector to the next
07:14 - level it basically lets you see
07:16 - literally all the data attached to one
07:18 - component or one entire game object you
07:20 - can view the data that is hidden by
07:22 - default all organized in a nice tree to
07:24 - see where that data exists you can also
07:26 - view as that data changes in real time
07:28 - you can track some specific fields and
07:30 - specific components and view them all at
07:32 - once or track when changes are made and
07:34 - throw a popup so this is kind of like a
07:36 - code debugger but for your data it's
07:38 - certainly a very Niche very unique tool
07:41 - it also even has a really complex
07:42 - looking API so you can work with it in
07:44 - any way you want then here's a simple
07:46 - one it's a polygon cutter it does
07:49 - exactly what you expect it helps you cut
07:51 - down polygons so you can slice any
07:53 - Sprite or you can also draw them so you
07:55 - can draw the shapes and it converts into
07:56 - an actual polygon you can make some
07:58 - ropes or make chains they work alongside
08:01 - with physics and you can then cut them
08:02 - down so if you want to make a game kind
08:04 - of like fruit ninja or Cut the Rope then
08:06 - this is really all you need all right so
08:08 - those are my top 10 new tools and
08:10 - systems on the UNS store for April 24
