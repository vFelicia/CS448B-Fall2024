06:11 - school feel here is Crow country it's
06:13 - got some nice PS1 sound Graphics very
06:16 - crunchy low poly textures and low poly
06:18 - assets it also has some great post-
06:20 - procing effects and another thing that
06:21 - gives this look is having a perspective
06:23 - camera but with a very low fov it makes
06:26 - the game clearly in 3D but very tight
06:28 - this is actually a visual sound that I'd
06:29 - love to try out someday the game itself
06:31 - is survival horror so there's been a
06:33 - mysterious disappearance and the abrupt
06:35 - closure of a theme park it's up to you
06:37 - to go investigate exactly what happened
06:39 - the game features lots of unique
06:40 - environments you can interact with all
06:42 - sorts of objects you can pick up things
06:44 - and have a nice inventory system then of
06:46 - course there are a bunch of really
06:47 - creepy characters waiting to pounce on
06:49 - you keep track of your ammo to make sure
06:50 - you don't run out explore the park see
06:53 - the sights and solve the mystery people

07:05 - horror then definitely give this a try
07:07 - then here's something really stylish
07:08 - called cryp Master right away you can
07:10 - see how it looks very unique standing
07:12 - out is one of the hardest part nowadays
07:14 - and this game succeeds right away at
07:16 - that it's an old school Dungeon Crawler
07:18 - so you move left right front back it's
07:20 - all about letters and words you can
07:22 - either write those letters or words or
07:23 - you can actually just speak with your
07:25 - voice you can say whatever you want each
07:27 - encounter has multiple solutions to
07:28 - discover the decipher some forgotten
07:30 - spells and then unleash them in Battle
07:32 - the Game features tons of unique
07:33 - gameplay mechanics everything from
07:35 - Creature collecting to card combat and
07:37 - even some barred rap battles it's
07:39 - certainly very unique game not just in
07:41 - visuals but actually in mechanics as
07:42 - well and people do seem to love it it's
07:44 - got over 500 overwhelmingly positive
07:46 - reviews then if you want to run your own
07:48 - Esports team look at Esports Godfather
07:50 - it's a deck building game simulating
07:52 - MOBA Esports you are the team coach and
07:54 - it's up to you to build your team Scout
07:56 - for promising athletes customize how
07:58 - they train join some matches and lead
08:00 - your team to Victory you can give some
08:02 - ORD to your team like for example should
08:04 - your Jer initiate a fight on the bottom
08:06 - lane or should everyone just push the
08:07 - Top Lane the match and the opponents are
08:09 - always learning so you need to adapt to
08:11 - your strategies in order to win also
08:12 - interestingly enough I think this is the
08:14 - first game that I'm seeing with the AI
08:16 - generated cond disclosure on Steam they
08:18 - used AI for character portraits and some
08:20 - illustrations I was curious to see how
08:21 - players would react to this and it seems
08:23 - that the answer is actually similar to
08:25 - using assets in your games meaning all
08:26 - that players want is really just fun
08:28 - games to play and this case the players
08:30 - are loving the game regardless of what
08:31 - was used to build it they have over
08:33 - 1,000 reviews at 90% positive and at
08:35 - number one for my personal pick of the
08:37 - month here's a very unique game that
08:38 - calls itself an engineering Rogue likee
08:40 - it's called Rogue voltage it's an
08:42 - extremely inventive game you have a
08:44 - board where you can wear some circuits
08:46 - you build machines and chain reactions
08:47 - to do all kinds of attacks and actions
08:49 - decide where you want to spend your
08:51 - energy so should you do an attack or
08:53 - maybe use a healing potion or sore that
08:55 - energy in a battery in order to make a
08:57 - massive attack in the future another
08:59 - another interesting mechanic is how you
09:01 - actually have control over when the
09:02 - turns happen so you can push your units
09:04 - either forwards or backwards in time in
09:06 - order to dodge all kinds of
09:07 - environmental attacks explore this world
09:09 - and try to make it to the end one step
09:11 - at a time different nodes have different
09:13 - enemies to fight or rewards together it
09:15 - looks extremely unique and people do
09:16 - seem to like it it is out now in Early
09:18 - Access with 200 very positive views all
09:21 - right so that's 10 awesome new games
09:22 - made with DMT launch in May 24 I hope
09:24 - this list helped you see how the unity
09:26 - engine is capable of building anything
09:27 - the limits are really just your own
09:28 - skills and imination check out my own
