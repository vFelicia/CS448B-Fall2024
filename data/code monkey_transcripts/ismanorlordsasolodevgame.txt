00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your codm so one
00:02 - game that has been blowing up recently
00:04 - is man Lords it was one of the most
00:05 - anticipated games of all time it had
00:07 - over 3 million wish list on Steam and as
00:09 - soon as it launched very quickly it
00:10 - surpassed 1 million units own story for
00:12 - this game is actually quite interesting
00:13 - it has been in development for 7 years
00:16 - and people went crazy for it as soon as
00:17 - it was announced the game looks really
00:19 - gorgeous and really complex the talk
00:20 - about this game is usually about two
00:22 - things first is how the game actually
00:24 - lives up to the hype it seems like a
00:25 - genely awesome game and secondly how
00:27 - it's amazing how all this was apparently
00:29 - built by a so Dev now that second part
00:31 - is what actually started a really
00:32 - interesting debate I saw a bunch of ton
00:34 - of it on Ren and now there's a really
00:35 - interesting interview on PC Gamer It's
00:37 - actually an interview with a developer
00:39 - of another different city Builder game
00:40 - it's called Fest fronti here this is
00:42 - another awesome game that people really
00:43 - love this one is made by an indie Studio
00:45 - it's not a Sol Dev and this came up
00:47 - during the interview because apparently
00:48 - they start receiving some feedback from
00:50 - players saying things like why does it
00:51 - take so long for this studio to build
00:53 - all kinds of features when a Sol Dev can
00:55 - apparently do it so quickly now as
00:57 - developer myself I have been on
00:58 - receiving end of some comments like
00:59 - these it is indeed quite frustrating now
01:01 - the article does point out that there's
01:03 - no animosity here they just got onto
01:05 - this topic while talking about player
01:06 - reviews in general and the things that
01:07 - some players say is indeed quite insane
01:09 - the most common one is really just going
01:10 - to any single player game and just
01:12 - saying why don't you make it multiplayer
01:14 - as if making a game multiplayer is just
01:15 - a one button press thing anyways The
01:17 - Narrative that met Lords would built by
01:19 - a single person that gives ammunition to
01:20 - these people to say these kinds of
01:22 - things if that solo Dev can technically
01:23 - do it why can't all of you so the
01:25 - question is does manal Lords count as a
01:27 - solo Dev game techically the game does
01:29 - have a single Sol Dev meaning the
01:30 - company behind it has just one single
01:32 - employee and for the first few years of
01:34 - development it was indeed just a single
01:35 - person working on it then at one point
01:37 - he got an epic Meg rant and started
01:39 - hiring some Freelancers this interview
01:40 - over here on the enen engine blog this
01:42 - interview very much highlights the solo
01:44 - Dev part of it in there he says after
01:46 - receiving the Meg rant I also started
01:48 - hiring more freelance artists help me
01:49 - with various tasks whether it's cleaning
01:51 - map adding illustrations to events
01:53 - little things that all add up to make
01:54 - the game look more like a finished
01:55 - product and less like a hobby project
01:57 - then if you look on the credits on the
01:59 - final game there's naturally a lot more
02:00 - than just one name on there I count
02:02 - about 250 different names there's also a
02:04 - behind the- scenes video on creating the
02:06 - soundtrack in there it showcas a
02:08 - composer and entire Orchestra so clearly
02:10 - a ton of different people touch on this
02:12 - game in some way the manal Lords have
02:14 - does say that these are all fair
02:15 - criticism and then in response to the
02:17 - farest Frontier developer he says the
02:18 - main difference is if I quit it's game
02:20 - over no more Mana Lords whereas if he
02:22 - quits a studio nothing changes I think
02:24 - that's actually an interesting
02:25 - definition for what counts as a Sol Dev
02:27 - meaning there's just one person driving
02:29 - development without that person nothing
02:30 - happens even though development itself
02:32 - might involve tons of contractors for
02:34 - doing art music sound and so on so I
02:36 - guess in this case for this game maybe a
02:37 - more appropriate title would be
02:38 - something like solo director there's
02:40 - only just one person controlling a small
02:42 - army of contractors I also saw a funny
02:44 - post on Reddit on how technically you
02:46 - can be a solo builder of an entire house
02:48 - just hire contractors to do the actual
02:49 - building and simply tell them what to do
02:51 - by this definition technically that
02:52 - would be a solo house Builder so solid
02:54 - Dev this definitely one of those terms
02:56 - that is really hard to Define for
02:57 - example in my case I consider myself a
02:59 - solid Dev I have built my games by
03:01 - myself but I've also hired artists I've
03:03 - hired musicians I've bought sound
03:04 - effects visual assets and even some
03:05 - tools in my game game cor DX I did all
03:08 - the programming and all the art myself
03:10 - and then I bought some sound effects and
03:11 - some music so does that count as a solo
03:13 - Dev game or another example on my game
03:15 - hyper Knights on this one I contracted
03:17 - an artist to draw pretty much all the
03:18 - Sprites then I did all the programming
03:20 - myself and bought some sound effects and
03:21 - music or in my latest game dinky
03:23 - gardiens I bought a ton of assets for
03:25 - all the visuals and even some tools then
03:27 - I also hired the composer to make some
03:28 - music but I still did all the game
03:29 - design and all the programing myself so
03:31 - does that count as a Sol Dev game it's
03:33 - an interesting question and I think
03:34 - there's no clear answer for it there's
03:36 - no objective way to define what is a Sev
03:38 - I think most people would consider what
03:39 - I did with my games to be a Sev but what
03:42 - if I contracted more artists and
03:43 - musicians what if I made an adventure
03:45 - game that was mainly just about visuals
03:46 - with very little programming at what
03:48 - point would it be considered not to be a
03:50 - Sol Dev game I've also actually seen
03:52 - some comments in some of my videos
03:53 - saying I'm not a Sol Dev because I
03:54 - didn't build my own engine and
03:56 - technically yeah that is true the games
03:58 - that I built those are built on top of
04:00 - an engine and that engine itself was
04:02 - built by thousands of people so my Sol
04:04 - Dev work is built on the shoulders of
04:06 - all those thousands of devs that built
04:07 - those TOS that I use well at the same
04:09 - time I think if you take that argument
04:10 - to the extreme then literally nothing is
04:11 - solid of even if you do end up building
04:13 - your own engine you certainly did not
04:15 - build your own operating system or your
04:16 - own PC so in order to be a complete
04:18 - solid Dev you need to build your own CPU
04:20 - from scratch build your own silicon your
04:22 - own bios your own operating system GPU
04:25 - your own engine generate your own power
04:26 - and so on at that point I think the term
04:28 - loses all its meaning but I really don't
04:30 - think most people are that extreme a
04:31 - while ago there was also an interesting
04:33 - similar debate on what exactly counts as
04:35 - an indie game the game Dave the diver
04:37 - was a huge hit and people called it an
04:39 - indie game they said that because of how
04:40 - it looks like a relatively small scale
04:42 - game with some pixel art but then people
04:44 - started to look deeper and they found
04:45 - that the developer is a small team
04:47 - inside of Nexon which is a giant public
04:49 - company so is this an IND game or not
04:51 - most people would probably say no
04:53 - because they're part of a huge company
04:54 - although they did get nominated for best
04:56 - indie game another question what about
04:58 - the Hitman games the studio I
04:59 - interactive technically they bought
05:01 - their independence back from Square Enix
05:03 - so is the next Hitman game going to be
05:04 - considered an indie game now probably
05:06 - not because it's going to be a super
05:07 - expensive game although if the
05:09 - definition is based on budget if so then
05:11 - what about studies like super giant
05:12 - games and Clay their budgets are indeed
05:14 - tens of millions of dollars but I think
05:15 - most people would consider them Indies
05:17 - so these are all interesting questions
05:18 - that all come from the fact that there's
05:19 - really no objective definition there's
05:21 - no rule that says okay you can hire up
05:23 - to three contractors in your ass so Dev
05:25 - above that you've got a team of
05:26 - Freelancers or some kind of rule that
05:28 - says Indie Games have budget of sub $1
05:30 - million something being an indie game or
05:32 - Sol Dev is really something that is just
05:33 - by feel it's a marketing thing although
05:35 - I also feel how it's very much not
05:37 - binary it's pretty much a spectrum in
05:38 - this case manal Lords I would say this
05:40 - one is very much on the edge of that
05:42 - Spectrum but like he says it is still
05:44 - mainly just one person driving
05:45 - development so I feel that term does
05:47 - apply slightly on the other hand for
05:49 - myself I don't do 100% myself I don't
05:51 - normally do art or sound so I would put
05:53 - myself somewhere around here at the end
05:54 - of the day some have are in the game
05:56 - these are really just interesting
05:57 - debates to have but I don't think it
05:58 - really matters in the end all that
05:59 - matters that the games themselves are
06:01 - awesome in this scenario that is very
06:02 - much the case whether you feel Sol Dev
06:04 - is applicable or not regardless of the
06:06 - label manner Lords is a genuinely
06:08 - awesome game and people are loving it so
06:10 - I'm curious to hear your thoughts on
06:11 - this do you consider manal Lords to be a
06:13 - Sol developed game at what point does it
06:15 - stop being a Sol Dev once you start
06:16 - involving contractors I'm certain
06:18 - there's going to be some real
06:18 - interesting discussion in the comments
06:20 - All right so thanks for watching and
06:21 - I'll see you next time
