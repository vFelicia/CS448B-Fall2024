00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - in this video we're continuing to create
00:03 - a graph in unity we're going to display
00:06 - our graph as a bar chart instead of a
00:08 - line graph let's get started
00:12 - so here I have my graph from the
00:14 - previous video we now have support for
00:17 - dynamic horizontal scaling and vertical
00:20 - scaling as well now depending on what
00:22 - values were trying to graph it might
00:24 - make more sense to use a bar chart
00:25 - rather than a line graph so first of all
00:28 - let's clean up our code and here we're
00:30 - using two different names and here we're
00:33 - creating a circle but then we're using a
00:35 - dot connection game object so that is
00:37 - not clean code to keep things consistent
00:39 - let's make own references called dot and
00:42 - here's a visual studio tip if you press
00:44 - ctrl R R you can rename an object in our
00:48 - code it won't automatically rename all
00:50 - instances of that object so in here
00:52 - certain game object won't be the dot
00:54 - game object and the create circle will
00:57 - become created dot the last circle game
01:00 - object becomes the last dot game object
01:02 - and up here the circle sprite becomes
01:05 - the Donal
01:07 - sprite and finally down here the dot has
01:10 - the name dot ok our code is now cleaner
01:13 - all our references are consistent and
01:15 - called dots so let's make our bar chart
01:18 - for now first of all we're going to go
01:20 - up here and simply comment out the line
01:23 - graph code but later we're going to make
01:25 - both types usable so let's just comment
01:27 - this out and comment this one okay so in
01:31 - here when we're creating the dots let's
01:33 - spawn a bar instead so let's go down
01:36 - here and make a private game object and
01:39 - call it create bar so in order to
01:43 - display our bar we need two things first
01:45 - we need the graph position of our value
01:47 - which is going to be the same that we
01:49 - used for spawning the dots and then
01:50 - we're going to receive the width of each
01:52 - of our values on our graph so in here
01:55 - I'm going to receive a vector two for my
01:57 - graph physician and a float for my bar
02:01 - width now for our code let's copy the
02:04 - dot code Seraph dot we're going to call
02:07 - it a bar it's also going to have an
02:09 - image but it will not have a sprite if
02:12 - you don't set a sprite on an image
02:13 - component it won't just display a solid
02:15 - color which is exactly what we want
02:17 - right now we still want to anchor it to
02:19 - the only one left side so this is
02:21 - correct and our ink
02:23 - position will be the graph position and
02:26 - now up here when we were previously
02:27 - spawning two dots let's spawn a bar so
02:31 - we're going to spawn with new vector2
02:33 - for my x position and my Y position and
02:36 - for the bar width we're going to give it
02:38 - the X size going to store the reference
02:41 - to our bar game object and add it to the
02:45 - game object list so it can be deleted
02:48 - okay let's S&C for spawning a square
02:51 - where the dots used to be yep there you
02:54 - we now have squares were used to have
02:56 - dots so let's make these squares into
02:58 - actual bars back into our create bar
03:01 - function for our anchored position the X
03:05 - is going to be the same as we're
03:06 - receiving in here on the graph position
03:08 - but the Y will be 0 since we want the
03:11 - bars to originate at the bottom of the
03:13 - graph so my anchored position will be a
03:15 - new vector2 on the graph position dot X
03:19 - and then 0 and for our size Delta we're
03:24 - going to have the X as our bar width and
03:28 - the Y as our graph position dot Y so
03:32 - let's test it out ok as you can see the
03:34 - size of each bar does appear to be
03:36 - correct but obviously the position is
03:38 - not it seems the bar is being scaled
03:40 - from the center which is located at 0
03:42 - there are two ways we can solve this
03:45 - first of all we can move the anchor
03:46 - position to the middle point between the
03:48 - bottom and the chart position or we can
03:51 - simply set the bar pivot to the bottom
03:53 - middle and the bar won't scale upwards
03:55 - from there so let's do the ladder
03:57 - so in here what's going to our right
03:59 - transform and modify the pivot which is
04:02 - a vector to the vector two is a
04:05 - normalized value so for my X since I
04:07 - want the middle I'm going to give it
04:09 - point five five and for my Y since I
04:12 - want the bottom let's set it to zero so
04:14 - this way the pivot should be on the
04:16 - center and the bottom so let's test it
04:19 - out and yep there you have it we took
04:21 - our line graph and we convert it into a
04:24 - bar chart you can see the first value
04:26 - has a height of five which was the value
04:29 - in our graph and the second one of about
04:31 - ninety eight and there it is if you want
04:33 - the bars to have a different width let's
04:36 - say in here
04:37 - sending our entire exercise let's just
04:39 - send 90% of our exercise and this way we
04:43 - can spawn bars with a bit of gap between
04:45 - them so there you have it we have
04:47 - transformed our line graph into a bar
04:49 - graph in the next video we're going to
04:51 - add the ability to switch between bar
04:53 - chart and line graph as always you can
04:56 - download the project files in new Tonys
04:58 - from unity code monkey comm if you have
05:01 - any questions post them in the comments
05:02 - and I'll do my best to answer them ok
05:04 - see you next time
