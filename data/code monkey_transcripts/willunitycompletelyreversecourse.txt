00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - okay so here let's analyze what I think
00:04 - will happen next also look at some
00:06 - answers on why this even happened then
00:08 - my advice on some changes that Unity
00:10 - could make and finally my advice to you
00:11 - going forward but first just the quick
00:13 - question in the title will ENT roll back
00:15 - these changes right now A lot of people
00:16 - are wondering if this truly is the
00:18 - platform or if there's a tiny chance for
00:20 - a reversal my quick answer is if you're
00:22 - waiting for a reversal then I would say
00:24 - don't wait if a phone reversal is the
00:26 - absolute only thing that would keep you
00:27 - in unity if so or simply if you film
00:30 - trust is damage Beyond repair then my
00:32 - simple advice is just move on to
00:33 - something else because personally I do
00:35 - not believe a big reversal is coming
00:36 - here are three reasons on why I think
00:38 - that now when I made the second video on
00:40 - this topic which was one day after the
00:42 - announcement and pretty much everything
00:43 - was on fire back then I generally
00:45 - believe there was a potential for a
00:47 - reversal considering the intensity of
00:48 - the backlash but given the recent
00:50 - updates where all they did was clarify
00:52 - what cuts as an insole and basically
00:54 - just to find some exceptions based on
00:55 - that it does seem like a reversal is
00:57 - really not coming at all at best they
00:59 - are willing to do do some compromises
01:01 - like we saw the exception on charity
01:02 - bundles demos and reinstalls but it
01:04 - generally does seem like they are really
01:06 - committed to going down this path
01:07 - basically since then the backlash has
01:09 - continued there's even a Twitter account
01:10 - tracking all these statements from all
01:12 - the various Studios who pretty much have
01:13 - just said they're not going to use int
01:15 - anymore basically the general consensus
01:17 - is there are devs there are in the
01:18 - middle of development and they won't
01:19 - keep using Unity to the end but most of
01:21 - them they feel that this is done
01:23 - irreparable harm and can no longer trust
01:25 - unity and will no longer use it in
01:26 - future projects so basically with that
01:28 - that's another reason why I don't think
01:29 - there will be a reversal basically a lot
01:32 - of people have already made up their
01:33 - minds and they won't quit UNT regardless
01:35 - of what happens so if you were to play
01:37 - Devil's Advocate and look at the Quant
01:38 - hard facts from minty side they
01:40 - basically got two options they can
01:42 - either revert this pricing or they can
01:44 - keep it now if they revert then those
01:47 - people who film this own situation has
01:48 - broken trust Beyond repair those will
01:50 - not return so they've still quit unity
01:53 - and of course by reverting the changes
01:55 - they obviously won't make any revenue
01:56 - from this thing whereas if they keep the
01:58 - new pricing then the have still quite
02:00 - TNT just the same but they do get extra
02:03 - Revenue perhaps the ones that say and
02:05 - pay the fee perhaps it won't be enough
02:06 - to offset the loss of all of these
02:08 - licenses so basically if you play that
02:10 - one's that there's really no benefit on
02:11 - them to go back so that's another reason
02:13 - why I really don't believe there won't
02:15 - be a reversal I think at this point they
02:16 - are really committed to going down this
02:17 - path no matter what and yet another
02:19 - reason is something that they actually
02:20 - themselves say on the various official
02:22 - posts they mentioned how these changes
02:24 - will not affect 90 of customers meaning
02:26 - they only impact the top 10 percent now
02:28 - unt's business is very top heavy they
02:30 - really only make money from a tiny
02:32 - handful of super huge devs those are
02:34 - devs that make things like engine impact
02:35 - and Marvel snap those are the ones that
02:37 - really make the money meaning that
02:39 - looking at all the posts on this Twitter
02:41 - account have gone through pretty much
02:42 - all of them and all I see are Indie devs
02:44 - the reality is unity's customers aren't
02:46 - really Indies like you or me it's the
02:48 - developers making the mega hits so in
02:50 - terms of backlash against these changes
02:51 - those aren't really the only ones that
02:52 - matter and I cannot find any public
02:55 - statements from those big developers
02:56 - although I assume there are some serious
02:58 - discussions happening behind all zores
03:00 - again at this point it really goes back
03:01 - to Simple Math if all of these
03:03 - developers quit but the likes of Marvel
03:05 - snap stays and happily pays the fee if
03:07 - so then it can actually be a net
03:08 - positive for them in terms of short-term
03:10 - profits so again if you're hoping for a
03:12 - phone reversal I don't believe it won't
03:13 - happen now if you're curious as to why
03:15 - this fee even came to be why this idea
03:17 - was even thought of in the first place
03:19 - there's a great Twitter thread with tons
03:21 - and tons of infos by someone who was
03:22 - there in the very early stages of this
03:24 - discussion which apparently happened one
03:25 - year ago now I highly encourage you to
03:27 - read this home thread if you want to get
03:29 - an inside look on why all this happened
03:30 - basically the core idea is that UNT
03:32 - spends a ton of money making the engine
03:34 - relevant supporting tons of unique
03:36 - platforms that is certainly very
03:37 - expensive and for the most part UNT has
03:40 - not made a profit I believe they only
03:41 - went into the green for these last two
03:42 - quarters and with interest rates rising
03:45 - and investment dollars pretty much
03:46 - drying up they desperately need more
03:47 - Revenue they can't really go back in the
03:49 - red just like it says here 80 of users
03:51 - don't pay anything at all basically it's
03:53 - the ads business that runs the engine
03:54 - now most people see UNT as a game engine
03:57 - that does ads on the side but the
03:59 - business reality is actually on the
04:00 - exact opposite Unity is really in that
04:02 - company with an engine on the side so
04:04 - they desperately need to get more money
04:05 - but ads are based on how many games
04:07 - people play and how much advertisers pay
04:09 - meaning they don't have much control
04:11 - over that what they can directly control
04:12 - is indeed get more revenue from the
04:14 - engine side of the business by
04:15 - introducing as a ref share or just like
04:17 - we saw a per game fee so this is yet
04:19 - another reason why it really does not
04:21 - seem that they are unlikely to go back
04:22 - on this they desperately need to make
04:24 - the company profitable in any way now if
04:26 - they are truly committed to going down
04:28 - this path if a complete reversal is
04:29 - absolutely not in the cards then here
04:31 - are my suggestions for how to make
04:33 - pretty much the best of a bad situation
04:34 - also before I mention my suggestions
04:37 - here is the same disclaimer that I made
04:39 - in my very first video I am a steam pc
04:41 - solo Indie Dev so my suggestions are
04:44 - coming from that one very specific point
04:45 - of view I am not a mobile expert I am
04:48 - not a free-to-play expert so I do hope
04:50 - that Unity won't listen to my
04:52 - suggestions but I also hope that they
04:54 - won't consult experts in all the other
04:55 - areas of game development when deciding
04:58 - what specific changes to implement the
04:59 - industry tree is huge and changes that
05:01 - might be good for one sector might be
05:03 - terrible for another one Unity have
05:04 - mentioned how the spirit of this program
05:06 - is really for them to succeed when
05:07 - developers succeed they have mentioned
05:09 - how it's not their intention to bankrupt
05:11 - anyone but right now just based on these
05:13 - rules just based on this chart it is
05:14 - technically possible for a developer to
05:16 - go bankrupt basically if your Revenue
05:18 - per user is under the fee amount then
05:20 - you're pretty much on the path to
05:21 - bankruptcy or simply just the case that
05:23 - they're talking about revenue and not
05:24 - profit so if your profit margins are so
05:27 - small that you cannot afford the fee
05:28 - then once again you go down to
05:29 - bankruptcy back to this Twitter thread
05:31 - there's actually a nice graph over here
05:33 - with some nice math and this personally
05:35 - shows the problem with the Pern sound
05:37 - model here you can see how some examples
05:39 - of fee is actually pretty fair for
05:40 - example up here Pokemon go they would
05:42 - pay literally 0.1 percent their revenue
05:44 - I think anyone would call 0.1 percent to
05:47 - be perfectly reasonable and also we can
05:48 - see that it is much better when compared
05:50 - to a flight Revenue share model so for
05:52 - Pokemon go making 60k under the parent
05:54 - selfie they would pay 60 bucks whereas
05:57 - under unreal is five percent they would
05:58 - pay three grand so definitely a much
06:00 - better deal however while the view works
06:03 - fine for this one case which is heavily
06:04 - monetizing its users it absolutely
06:06 - completely fails on games like for
06:07 - example over here Among Us in this case
06:09 - the FIFA Among Us would be a whopping 55
06:12 - or for an even worse result here is a
06:14 - hyper casual game called Bridge race and
06:16 - for this one the fee would actually be
06:18 - 180 now that is obviously completely
06:20 - insane if your fee is higher than your
06:22 - Revenue then you can obviously only end
06:24 - in bankruptcy and over here the
06:26 - following comments will point out
06:27 - exactly the same problem and basically
06:29 - the proposed solution is it would be
06:31 - individually negotiated with UNT so
06:33 - basically as things sent right now
06:34 - basically you would have to trust their
06:35 - intentions you would have to trust that
06:37 - they generally do not wish the bankrupt
06:39 - developers and you would also need to
06:40 - trust that if this scenario were to
06:42 - happen they would actually make an
06:43 - exception and help you not go bankrupt
06:45 - but right now obviously trust is
06:47 - something that UNT lacks so here's my
06:49 - very simple feedback on this issue if
06:51 - the intention is genuinely to merely
06:53 - make money when developers also make
06:54 - money and not bankrupt them if that
06:56 - truly and genuinely is the intention
06:58 - behind this fee then I believe believe
07:00 - that the rules should clearly reflect
07:01 - that meaning my suggestion would be just
07:03 - at a simple Revenue cap something like
07:05 - three percent or five percent so the fee
07:07 - would either be the parent selfie or the
07:09 - revenue royalty whichever one is most so
07:11 - in this example on Pokemon go would pay
07:13 - 60 bucks and then Among Us would pay
07:15 - four bucks again if the goal is indeed
07:17 - to only succeed when developers succeed
07:18 - then I believe that this very simple
07:20 - rule would make that call a reality
07:21 - while keeping developers safe from these
07:23 - insane edge cases now for some more
07:25 - feedback my suggestion regarding the
07:27 - issues with insounds on different
07:29 - devices again in Tia said it is not in
07:31 - the spirit that this program to
07:32 - overcharge the bumpers that's why they
07:34 - want back the fee on green songs and
07:35 - demos but they still confirm that it
07:37 - sounds on different devices those will
07:39 - be charged and the reason for that is
07:41 - because they don't want to track
07:42 - identity across devices that would
07:44 - pretty much break a ton of privacy laws
07:46 - I can understand how it's secondly
07:48 - impossible to track this over multiple
07:49 - devices without breaking those laws so
07:51 - my suggestion to solve this problem is
07:53 - very simple just allow developers to
07:55 - self-report like for example just allow
07:57 - me to send you a screenshot of my sim
07:58 - stats and do the math based is on copy
08:00 - sold if there's a huge discrepancy
08:02 - between the self-reported numbers and
08:04 - the estimates then sure go ahead and dig
08:05 - deeper but most developers are going to
08:07 - be honest so I do not believe that
08:09 - self-reporting with only two tons of
08:10 - fraud so once again if it truly is your
08:12 - intention to not punish the bumpers if
08:15 - the problem with Multi-Device installs
08:16 - is simply privacy laws then this should
08:18 - be a very simple fix by doing the math
08:20 - based on copy sold and allowing
08:22 - developers to self-report their stats
08:24 - using that it wouldn't allow developers
08:25 - like me to sell games on Steam and then
08:27 - allow those people to install the game
08:28 - on any advice they own like for example
08:30 - their PC and also on their steam deck
08:32 - without incurring extra fees and the
08:33 - self-report feature with also some of
08:35 - the Privacy problems instead of trying
08:37 - to detect piracy which is essentially an
08:39 - impossible problem once again just
08:41 - allowed the film port to self-report and
08:42 - do the math based on those numbers and
08:44 - not whatever method you have for the
08:46 - Technic piracy which again currently
08:47 - developers do not trust unity and so far
08:49 - UNT has responded to the privacy
08:51 - concerns with basically just trust them
08:52 - just trust their super magic algorithm
08:54 - whereas if you don't have self-reporting
08:56 - then there's really no trust needed the
08:58 - developer gives you their real numbers
08:59 - and math is based on that also just
09:01 - another simple suggestion apparently
09:03 - yunty personal now requires an internet
09:05 - connection for three days I don't know
09:06 - if this is new if this was already the
09:08 - case or it changed alongside this fee
09:10 - either way I really don't see why this
09:12 - needs to exist I assume it's to prevent
09:14 - some kind of abuse but I really have no
09:16 - idea on what exactly that abuse could be
09:17 - so maybe there's a good reason for it
09:19 - but I generally cannot see it so unless
09:22 - I'm missing something super important my
09:23 - suggestion would simply be just remove
09:25 - this requirement it's a free version
09:27 - this is for hobbies this is for people
09:28 - who are actually trying to learn making
09:30 - small games there's no reason to force
09:32 - them to have an internet connection and
09:34 - my final suggestion is not really mine
09:36 - but it's actually from Frey and several
09:38 - other people basically make the changes
09:40 - only apply to Unity 2024 and Beyond then
09:42 - also other people have expanded upon
09:44 - this and basically asked for a terms of
09:45 - service that is logged to a specific
09:47 - version that way technically Unity would
09:49 - be legally unable to make changes like
09:51 - this after the fact now while I think
09:53 - these changes would be great personally
09:55 - I really don't expect these to happen
09:56 - and the reason is based on the same
09:57 - analysis on why I don't think they want
09:59 - reverse course the entire Point behind
10:01 - this change is to get money from the
10:03 - likes of Pokemon go and gentian impact
10:04 - those games were launched years ago and
10:06 - they continued to live nowadays so if
10:08 - they were to modify the terms to make it
10:10 - so that the new fee is only applicable
10:11 - to Future games they would simply not
10:13 - get money from those games so that is
10:15 - why well I think this change would
10:16 - generally be great I really don't have
10:18 - much hope of it happening finally here's
10:21 - one very simple suggestion this chart
10:23 - over here really has one very
10:24 - nonsensical part and it's really this
10:26 - entire comment over here for ENT
10:28 - personal there is absolutely no reason
10:30 - why anyone would ever pay 20 cents per
10:32 - install the reason is because apparently
10:34 - the elements update instantly the second
10:35 - you change license so basically if you
10:38 - have a game and it has 200 000 installs
10:40 - and has made a hundred ninety thousand
10:42 - dollars then at that point you would
10:43 - just buy ENT Pro which instantly raised
10:45 - the limit to one mill so basically
10:46 - there's absolutely no logical reason why
10:48 - anyone would pay this fee based on this
10:50 - my very simple advice is just get rid of
10:52 - this entire side just add a revenue
10:54 - threshold on the free version pretty
10:56 - much like it was before if you make over
10:58 - a million dollars then you have to
10:59 - switch to Pro that's really it if you do
11:01 - that then you can completely cut down
11:03 - this column and nothing changes I
11:04 - believe that will really help simplify
11:06 - things since there's absolutely no
11:07 - reason why anyone would ever pay this
11:09 - one specific fee and now that I've given
11:11 - my feedback to Unity let me give you the
11:13 - viewer the unity developer my advice on
11:15 - what to do like I said taking the
11:17 - assumption that these changes are not
11:19 - going to reverse the fee is here to stay
11:21 - so with that assumption let's take some
11:22 - time to look at them as I said you can
11:24 - completely ignore the personal side that
11:26 - makes no sense if you get close to this
11:27 - you just get Unity Pro so let's just
11:29 - worry about this column this meltdown
11:31 - threshold now my advice to you is simply
11:33 - do the exact same thing that I did on
11:35 - the very first video on this topic
11:36 - basically just look at this chart
11:38 - analyze these rules carefully and calmly
11:40 - and decide what do you want to do next
11:41 - like I mentioned my own use case my
11:44 - games will never make a million dollars
11:45 - so my decision is simply I won't keep
11:47 - using Unity because for my specific use
11:49 - case I will never pay anything if your
11:52 - use case is also steam pc in the games
11:54 - if so then chances are you will never go
11:57 - over to this limit so you will never
11:58 - have to pay any fee now if your use case
12:00 - are free to play mobile games where you
12:02 - expect to only be able to monetize each
12:04 - user at under a dollar if so then I
12:06 - would definitely highly advise you
12:07 - against using Unity unless you somehow
12:10 - trust them enough to give you a special
12:11 - deal or yet another thing you can do is
12:13 - as many people I point out for some
12:15 - people the numbers don't matter at all
12:17 - for some people they don't care if the
12:19 - numbers are fair or unfair for some
12:21 - people what matters most is trust and
12:23 - they feel that ENT can never be trusted
12:24 - again if that's you then here my advice
12:27 - is you should probably quit Unity unless
12:28 - you feel there's some way they can
12:30 - regain your trust although again if the
12:32 - only way that they could regain your
12:33 - trust is to revert these changes then I
12:35 - really don't think this will happen and
12:37 - now let me also address some very valid
12:38 - points that people directed at me when I
12:40 - said that I won't keep using Unity
12:41 - because the fees do not apply to me most
12:43 - comments were saying something like okay
12:45 - so the fees right now don't affect you
12:46 - but tomorrow they couldn't lower the
12:48 - limit to a low amount which would affect
12:49 - you and my answer to that is yep that
12:51 - could definitely happen they could
12:53 - change the terms tomorrow and change
12:54 - them to something much much worse
12:56 - however personally I see that's really
12:58 - true of everything I'm right here on
13:00 - YouTube which is also a company that is
13:01 - known for changing crazy things that no
13:03 - one wanted technically I could wake up
13:05 - tomorrow and my channel would be
13:06 - completely demonetized or just outright
13:09 - deleted or another example seem could
13:11 - suddenly decide tomorrow to up their
13:12 - rate from 30 to 90 technically that
13:15 - could happen so personally for this
13:17 - argument I really don't find Productive
13:19 - to panic about all the bad things that
13:21 - definitely could happen instead for me I
13:23 - assume a look at the current reality and
13:24 - just adapt to it if tomorrow Unity
13:26 - changed these terms once more then I
13:28 - will once again read the new terms and
13:30 - come to a new decision that's also the
13:31 - exact same reason why personally I don't
13:33 - consider the trust factor in making my
13:35 - decision I've never really relied on
13:37 - trusting or distrusting Unity for me it
13:40 - is merely a tool it is a tool with
13:42 - certain capabilities and of course a
13:43 - certain cost if the capabilities or the
13:46 - cost changes then I will analyze new
13:48 - reality and once again adapt to it at
13:50 - the end of the day this is really your
13:51 - decision so make your decision on what
13:53 - engine you want to use based on whatever
13:55 - criteria you decide like I said in the
13:57 - previous two videos I'm not trying to
13:58 - change anyone's mind whether you stay or
14:00 - quit Unity either way that's fine by me
14:02 - all I can say is I generally wish you
14:05 - the best of luck in your game Dev
14:06 - Journey regardless of what engine you
14:07 - choose to use alright so thanks for
14:09 - watching and I'll see you next time
