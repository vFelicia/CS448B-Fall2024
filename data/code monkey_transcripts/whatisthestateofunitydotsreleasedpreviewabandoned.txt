00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video let's do a quick
00:03 - overview of what is the current state of
00:05 - unity dots
00:06 - although more accurately let's look at
00:08 - the state of entities the only reason
00:10 - why i put dots in the title is because
00:12 - there's still quite a lot of confusion
00:13 - and if i just put entities in the title
00:15 - then a lot of people won't know exactly
00:17 - what that is
00:18 - so as a quick refresher dot stands for
00:20 - the data oriented technology stack and
00:23 - that stack is composed of three things
00:25 - ecs the entity component system or just
00:28 - called entities
00:29 - then it's the job system and the burst
00:31 - compiler of those three the job system
00:33 - and the burst compiler have already been
00:35 - fully production ready for several years
00:37 - the only one still in preview is
00:39 - entities so when you hear dots remember
00:41 - that it composes of three things and two
00:43 - of them have already been out
00:45 - and right now there's actually already
00:46 - been some games launched that used dots
00:48 - in various ways
00:50 - one of them was diplomacy is not an
00:52 - option it's a really awesome castle
00:53 - defense game with thousands of units so
00:55 - it's very clearly using dots
00:57 - another one is zenith in less city this
01:00 - is a vr mmo on a massive scale with tons
01:02 - of players and enemies it's been
01:04 - monumentally successful and extremely
01:06 - well received by players and critics
01:07 - alike they talked about how they use
01:10 - dots in this year's gdc how entities
01:12 - help them in many ways it was really
01:14 - interesting
01:15 - another recent example which also found
01:17 - massive success is v rising great game i
01:20 - quite enjoyed playing it myself i even
01:21 - made a video recreating the very unique
01:23 - sunlight mechanic and this is also
01:25 - another one that also had a really
01:27 - interesting dev breakdown on unity
01:29 - switch
01:30 - so even though dots is still technically
01:32 - in development there's already been some
01:33 - games putting this awesome tag to good
01:35 - use so over here let's do a quick
01:37 - overview to check out the current state
01:39 - of entities this is not a step-by-step
01:41 - tutorial i'm waiting for the final phone
01:43 - release before i do a full-fledged
01:45 - tutorial on it
01:46 - and speaking of that final release the
01:48 - most important thing about the current
01:49 - state is the current roadmap they
01:51 - unveiled an updated roadmap a while ago
01:53 - and the goal is to have entities hit 1.0
01:56 - by early next year they are targeting to
01:58 - have it production ready alongside unity
02:01 - 22lts so around march or april next year
02:04 - as to what 1.0 entails we can look at
02:07 - the other cards on the roadmap to get a
02:08 - nice idea importantly is a ton of ui and
02:12 - ux improvements
02:13 - for me i haven't touched dots in about
02:15 - two years and back then it was already
02:17 - really awesome in terms of results but
02:18 - it was definitely lacking in terms of
02:20 - basic tools of the editor windows you
02:22 - had for inspecting things they were all
02:24 - just mountains of text that was really
02:26 - difficult to navigate you couldn't even
02:28 - click to select a specific unit you had
02:30 - to find it in the entity list and
02:32 - somehow selected from the thousands of
02:34 - entities in the world so one of the main
02:36 - goals for 1.0 is to fix all of that to
02:39 - make it so it has regular ui windows
02:41 - with the same level of ux that you're
02:43 - used to in the regular unity tools
02:46 - so here in the roadmap we can see
02:47 - hierarchy windows showing both game
02:49 - objects and entities you can visualize
02:51 - components systems and archetypes and
02:53 - very important scene packing so being
02:55 - able to click on an entity to select it
02:57 - then also on the roadmap are some more
02:59 - debugging tools compatibility with game
03:02 - objects so the final goal is to use a
03:04 - hybrid approach meaning using game
03:06 - objects where it makes sense and using
03:08 - entities where that makes sense
03:10 - in the beginning when dots was announced
03:11 - a lot of people thought the future would
03:13 - be pure ecs but now it's looking like a
03:15 - hovered approach won't be the best
03:16 - approach entities is also meant to come
03:19 - with its own ecs based multiplayer which
03:22 - is going to be really interesting using
03:24 - entity is going to allow for a massive
03:26 - amount of objects all of them correctly
03:27 - synchronized in multiplayer then of
03:29 - course entity is great for a large scale
03:31 - simulation that's exactly one of the
03:33 - things that entities allows that is
03:34 - simply not possible with game objects
03:37 - and finally of course lots of learning
03:38 - content entities and dots is really
03:40 - awesome but it does have quite a steep
03:42 - learning curve than just learning game
03:44 - objects so that's the current state of
03:46 - the roadmap for me the important part is
03:48 - really just 1.0 next year but let's look
03:50 - beyond the roadmap into the current
03:52 - state of the package
03:53 - right now you can use version 0.51 in
03:56 - the latest unity 21lts version
03:59 - in case you don't know this was the huge
04:01 - update that happened recently about
04:02 - three months ago unity basically stopped
04:05 - updating entities publicly for about a
04:07 - year they just worked on it privately
04:09 - and then suddenly they came out with
04:10 - this roadmap and a huge upgrade to
04:12 - version .50 and now 0.51 there were
04:15 - quite a few changes from the old version
04:17 - 0.17 but at the same time not really
04:19 - that many changes
04:21 - meaning that if you like me play the
04:22 - round with dots when it was first
04:24 - announced all the core concepts are
04:26 - still the same you still have entities
04:28 - you still have components and systems
04:30 - there are still archetypes memory chunks
04:32 - trucks and so on
04:34 - so the videos that i made on dots quite
04:35 - a long time ago those can still be very
04:37 - useful for learning the car concepts
04:39 - behind a more data oriented approach
04:42 - although of course to make the code in
04:43 - those videos work requires a bunch of
04:45 - syntax changes and thankfully on the
04:47 - documentation there's a really nice page
04:49 - to help you convert a 0.17 project into
04:51 - 0.51
04:53 - so if there's any old projects you have
04:54 - that you'd like to play with again or
04:56 - maybe follow some old tutorials then you
04:58 - can follow that upgrade path it all
05:00 - looks pretty simple you just need to
05:01 - relearn the new syntax for example job
05:04 - component system has been replaced with
05:06 - system base the dependencies for all the
05:08 - jobs have also been simplified so you no
05:10 - longer need to manually handle them
05:12 - yourself the code definitely looks quite
05:14 - a bit cleaner there's also changes to
05:16 - ijaw for each being replaced with ijob
05:19 - entity and again looking at the code
05:21 - side by side it's definitely cleaner the
05:23 - main complaint about dots since it was
05:25 - first announced is that it looks
05:26 - extremely complex and has tons of
05:28 - boilerplate code
05:29 - so these changes from 0.17 to 0.51 these
05:33 - definitely show that they are going in
05:34 - the right direction of making it easier
05:36 - to write good dots code netcode for
05:38 - entities which is the multiplayer part
05:40 - also got some updates as did the hybrid
05:42 - renderer and the dots physics there is
05:45 - also now a new build process so rather
05:47 - than going through final build like you
05:48 - do when building a regular unity project
05:51 - nowadays with dots you install the
05:52 - platform's package then create a kind of
05:55 - build configuration and use that to make
05:57 - the belt i wonder if this is just a
05:59 - temporary thing that will later on be
06:00 - integrated into the regular build
06:02 - pipeline this is the one part that still
06:04 - looks quite a bit janky so those really
06:06 - are the main changes of going from point
06:08 - 17 to point 51 based on most these
06:11 - changes it does seem that work is
06:12 - continuing in the right direction then
06:14 - the forums they also continue being very
06:16 - active with lots of people asking
06:18 - questions and unity devs entering them
06:20 - so for the current state i would say
06:22 - that everything is progressing nicely
06:24 - and the roadmap to hit 1.0 by next year
06:26 - doesn't look to be on track
06:27 - the question remains which is how much
06:29 - more different will 1.0 be from the
06:31 - current version 0.51
06:33 - they say that it's a breaking change as
06:35 - you would expect but based on how easy
06:37 - it is to upgrade from point 17 to 0.51
06:40 - based on that it does seem like
06:42 - upgrading to 1.0 might also be a pretty
06:44 - painless process so perhaps if you have
06:46 - a game idea that you're planning to
06:48 - launch by next year maybe you can start
06:50 - researching to see if dots can be useful
06:51 - for that project and definitely make
06:53 - sure to check out those dot songs from
06:55 - gdc and the recent v-rising interview
06:58 - they are great to see how studios are
07:00 - already using it in final games even
07:01 - though it's technically not yet ready
07:03 - also unite 22 which is unity's big
07:06 - conference this one is in a few months
07:07 - in november so i'm guessing we'll also
07:09 - be hearing a bit more about dots in
07:11 - there and also another quick mention if
07:13 - you're interested in dots then a great
07:14 - channel that does primarily dot's
07:16 - content is turbo makes games johnny is
07:18 - constantly up to date with everything
07:20 - related to dots and doing some tutorials
07:22 - on the latest versions so if you want to
07:24 - play around with dots before i make a
07:25 - phone tutorial on it next year or you
07:27 - just want to keep up to date with the
07:28 - news and updates and definitely follow
07:30 - his channel as for me like i said i'm
07:32 - going to continue watching from the
07:33 - sidelines with a lot of interest i
07:35 - really think dots will open up tons of
07:37 - possibilities for the types of games
07:38 - that you can create especially since for
07:40 - me the types of games that i like to
07:42 - play are usually around strategy or
07:44 - management games with lots of systems
07:45 - lots of objects and everything
07:47 - interacting with one another so for
07:49 - those types of games i do think dots
07:50 - will be very much a game changer
07:53 - so the current state is looking great
07:54 - and i'm really looking forward to the
07:56 - future alright hope that's useful check
07:58 - out these videos to learn some more
08:00 - thanks to these awesome patreon
08:01 - supporters for making these videos
08:03 - possible thank you for watching and i'll
08:05 - see you next time
08:09 - [Music]
08:12 - you
