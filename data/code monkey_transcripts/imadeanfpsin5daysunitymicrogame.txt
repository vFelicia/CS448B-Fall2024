00:00 - in this video I'm going to go through an
00:01 - overview of the FPS that I built these
00:03 - past few days using the unity FPS micro
00:06 - game as a base this game is nice and
00:08 - short with some interesting level design
00:10 - and some unique mechanics there's a
00:12 - hook-shot shield transformers mission
00:14 - briefing final boss fight and more let's
00:17 - begin
00:20 - [Music]
00:24 - okay so first of all if you haven't
00:27 - played it yet then go check the link in
00:28 - the description and come back here
00:30 - afterwards the game is very quick only
00:32 - about five minutes and is fully playable
00:34 - in your browser so go check it out play
00:36 - through it and then continue in here
00:38 - alright so if you're back here I assume
00:40 - you've played through it as you saw the
00:42 - game has a bunch of interesting features
00:44 - there's the awesome shield effect
00:46 - connect to the Transformers there's the
00:48 - hookshot which feels very nice to play
00:50 - with the mission briefing display inside
00:52 - the helicopter as well as jumping down
00:55 - into the landing zone to start my level
00:56 - super fast mini enemies two unique
00:59 - weapons plus the grenades a nice
01:01 - elevator and the final boss fight with
01:04 - multiple stages those are all the things
01:06 - that I added on to the FPS micro game
01:09 - base ok so now first of all the reason
01:11 - why I was able to get this up and
01:13 - running so quickly is because the base
01:15 - of this game is the just-released unity
01:17 - FPS micro game if you're not familiar
01:19 - with micro games this is a great new
01:21 - thing that unity has been doing recently
01:22 - in order to help new developers get
01:24 - started so if you're a beginner I
01:26 - suggest you look at them and play around
01:27 - you can find all of the micro games on
01:30 - the unity hub over here you just open it
01:33 - and go into the unlearn tab and here you
01:35 - can see all of the various micro games
01:37 - as well as a bunch more stuff so
01:38 - previously we had the Carling micro game
01:40 - then the platformer micro game and now
01:43 - it's just been released the FPS micro
01:45 - game they come as a completed playable
01:47 - based game and then you have a bunch of
01:49 - mini tutorials which they call mods in
01:51 - order to add more things onto it so for
01:53 - example you can modify the FPS micro
01:55 - game to add a new weapon type by
01:57 - following this Motty turn
01:58 - so that's unity micro games a great
02:01 - feature for complete beginners to
02:02 - quickly get started using unity even for
02:05 - more experienced developers this can be
02:07 - a great way to quickly get a prototype
02:08 - up and running and test your ideas just
02:10 - like I've done in this project also next
02:13 - month there won't be a very nice
02:14 - livestream game jam using the FPS micro
02:17 - game as a base it will be on November 24
02:20 - and it will be hosted by Android from
02:22 - mixing jam alongside myself and couch
02:24 - ferret as well as Alayna from unity it
02:27 - won't be a very fun livestream so make
02:29 - sure you add the day to your calendar in
02:30 - order to build something awesome there's
02:32 - almost a chance to win some community
02:34 - swag so here I took that nice fps
02:37 - as a starting point and I built upon it
02:39 - here you can see the entire level in the
02:41 - editor we start off at the helicopter
02:43 - when here keep going through here and as
02:46 - you can see a bunch of enemies already
02:48 - placed a bunch of worn aides there and
02:50 - there's a door and a key over here a
02:52 - weapon pickup then we go through the
02:54 - elevator and over here the nice shield
02:57 - and all the way here in the end we have
02:59 - the turret boss alright so let's start
03:02 - playing through the game and I'll talk
03:03 - about all the features and mechanics
03:05 - that I added ok here is the starting
03:07 - point we start off on our helicopter and
03:09 - after a while the door opens and the
03:11 - color turns green and you can see the
03:13 - objective we need to recover the
03:15 - microchip over here we have a nice
03:17 - mission briefing so it showcases our
03:20 - goal which is on the enemy bus turret
03:22 - which is our final boss fight the way
03:25 - this is working is a simple render
03:27 - texture and over here I have a camera
03:29 - just flying around and it's rendering
03:30 - onto this ok so that's our goal now
03:34 - let's begin so we can just out here look
03:37 - at the home level so you can see the
03:39 - boss in there the third level there 2nd
03:41 - level and there it's where we start so
03:43 - now I can jump out and as I jump out
03:46 - there you go I go straight into the
03:47 - landing zone and there we have some nice
03:49 - particle effects the drop is handled
03:51 - through code so we make sure that
03:52 - whenever we jump we always land on our
03:54 - landing position ok we start off with a
03:56 - very basic lesson this is the default
03:59 - weapon on the FPS micro game and here we
04:02 - can move into the first area and there
04:04 - you go there's an enemy in there and
04:06 - another one running over there and there
04:07 - you go he spotted me this is a very
04:09 - quick micro enemy so he moves very fast
04:12 - but dies very easily and there is
04:14 - the foam enemy now as we press through
04:21 - here we can see a nice red door and over
04:24 - here another enemy's you can shoot them
04:26 - and in here we have a nice deterrent
04:28 - message so here let's press G to look at
04:31 - the UN aid and there's an enamine there
04:33 - press G and there you go there goes the
04:34 - grenade and after a while it explodes
04:36 - and causes area of effect damage so
04:38 - let's try to hit that one over there and
04:40 - shoot this one and there he is and throw
04:47 - the grenade after a while it explodes
04:49 - and there you took him out right so
04:51 - those are some very simple grenades it's
04:54 - essentially just a rigid body being
04:55 - thrown with the script that explodes
04:57 - after a certain amount of time so we
04:59 - take out all the enemies and now here in
05:01 - the corner you can see a nice wall with
05:03 - this nice crack texture this is meant to
05:06 - indicate that hidden destructible wall
05:08 - so if we shoot it we can get access to a
05:10 - nice sitting area so there you go and we
05:12 - have some more grenades and over here we
05:15 - have our nice key so we can pick it up
05:18 - as you can see the key is on item being
05:21 - nicely animated so pick it up and there
05:23 - you go that's in the UI so we are
05:24 - currently holding our key no let's go
05:26 - into the door and when we approach the
05:29 - door there you go it plays a nice
05:31 - animation and the door opens all right
05:33 - great now let's go through here and over
05:36 - here we have another weapon so we move
05:38 - it and we pick it up and that's the
05:39 - rocket launcher as the name implies this
05:41 - fires some slow-moving rockets that
05:43 - explode on contact and have an area of
05:46 - effect damage there you go that one
05:48 - tasty I always love rocket launchers so
05:50 - when doing a FPS micro game I have to a
05:53 - minute
05:53 - now there we have a nice turret so let's
05:56 - take them out then in here we have
05:59 - another enemy so we can use the nice
06:01 - flash damage and it's very nice alright
06:09 - so as he dies he drops a nice blue King
06:11 - so we can now pick it up approach the
06:14 - blue door and it plays the animation and
06:16 - opens a nice door now inside we have
06:19 - another weapon this is a nice rail gun
06:21 - so this is pretty much a sniper rifle so
06:24 - we can zoom in very far and fire the
06:26 - weapon and land exactly on the target
06:28 - position so whereas the others are
06:30 - projectile weapons this is a hitscan
06:32 - weapon then in here we have a nice
06:37 - elevator so as we go in it starts
06:39 - playing and there you go it starts
06:41 - moving up and we can see that we are
06:43 - indeed moving up and after a while we
06:44 - reach the knee level
06:46 - so here we have a bunch of enemies
06:48 - waiting for us and let's try to shoot
06:49 - them and these small ones are our best
06:52 - animal with a nice splash damage and
06:54 - just take them all out just like that
06:55 - they're right over there you can see
06:59 - something really interesting there is a
07:01 - turret inside a very nice shield and if
07:05 - I try to shoot I cannot shoot through
07:06 - the shield but there you go he sees me
07:09 - and he can shoot me
07:10 - I made this nice shield effect in shade
07:20 - of grass and it looks really cool so see
07:22 - tuned for a tutorial on how to make it
07:25 - as you can see he can shoot me but I
07:27 - cannot shoot him so I need to destroy
07:29 - the shield and here on the floor you can
07:31 - see some power lines coming off of the
07:33 - shield and they are connecting to this
07:35 - thing and this is meant to be a
07:37 - transformer so we can shoot it
07:39 - we destroy it and when we destroy it you
07:41 - can see that the powerlines vanished
07:43 - so with that power line of wine we can
07:45 - now look and see that there's another
07:47 - one going through here so let's follow
07:49 - and see where this lands and in here we
07:52 - have a nice pickup and if we move in
07:55 - there you go we have captured our hook
07:57 - shot so this is a really cool mechanic
07:59 - that took me quite a while to make right
08:01 - so we press F and there you go it fires
08:03 - something and it tells me towards it
08:08 - this is a really fun mechanic to play
08:11 - with so I can go I can jump in me there
08:12 - and keep the momentum and there you go
08:15 - it looks very nice almost kind of like
08:17 - Spider Man
08:18 - so there you go just fire it and go
08:20 - through and there's an enemy in there so
08:22 - I can go and I can fire in the air and
08:24 - now I fallen off the map so I can go and
08:26 - there you go okay great so as you can
08:28 - see a very nice interesting mechanic so
08:32 - this will be very useful for the final
08:34 - boss fight as you will see and here just
08:36 - take out these enemies so with them down
08:40 - now I can take out the last transformer
08:42 - there go the power line is offline and
08:45 - now look yep there you go he is no one
08:47 - protected by a shield so with the shield
08:51 - gone we can now easily take him out that
08:53 - for some Rockets there you go he's gone
08:57 - okay
08:57 - great over here in the corner we can
09:00 - also see this and picked up some more
09:02 - grenades now let's pick up the purple
09:04 - key open the purple door and there you
09:06 - go we now have access into our very nice
09:08 - boss fight so let's go into it okay we
09:15 - go in make sure we have full health and
09:16 - there you go he starts shooting right
09:18 - away but luckily we have some nice
09:20 - colors that we can use in order to take
09:22 - cover and after dealing and update
09:25 - there you go the shield has been spun as
09:28 - well as some enemies so we can all
09:30 - longer damage him we now need to destroy
09:32 - all the transformers however since this
09:36 - whole thing is encasing last we can use
09:38 - the very nice hook shot in order to move
09:41 - and slide around so I can go here get
09:43 - fire there and this whole movement feels
09:45 - very nice very satisfying and there's
09:53 - another one and there yo now he's
09:55 - available and I'm gonna shoot them and
09:58 - there you go we have reached the next
10:00 - stage of the boss fight and this is
10:03 - actually quite hectic in quite we don't
10:06 - they keep talking and play at the same
10:07 - time so let's see if I can make it
11:00 - now we are on the final stage the
11:04 - enemies are still being spawned we also
11:07 - have some grenades being spawned talent
11:09 - to player and they also drop some home
11:25 - and there you go I took him out with a
11:27 - nice grenade so as he saw once he went
11:30 - down all the minions went down with him
11:32 - all right so that was quite stressful
11:34 - but also quite fun the hook shot works
11:36 - really well in order to combine it with
11:39 - a nice rocket launcher so I can fire and
11:41 - I can keep going keep jumping around as
11:43 - he saw it's a very interesting bus fight
11:47 - so wear them down as you can see he
11:49 - dropped the nice microchip which is our
11:51 - current objective so we can go pick it
11:54 - up and there you go now we have the
11:55 - final objective we need to leave with a
11:57 - microchip so let's go and over there we
12:00 - can see the nice helicopter in order to
12:02 - leave this area so let's go into it jump
12:05 - inside any of there you go we have
12:06 - completed our mission objectives
12:08 - completed awesome so here you saw the
12:15 - entire game I've built starting from the
12:17 - FPS micro game as you saw the game has
12:19 - quite a bunch of interesting features
12:21 - the mission briefing displays inside the
12:23 - helicopter and jumping down into the
12:25 - landing zone to start on level the
12:27 - superfast mini enemies to unique weapons
12:30 - plus the grenades a nice elevator the
12:34 - awesome shield effect connected to the
12:36 - Transformers the hook shot which films
12:38 - great to use and the final boss fight
12:41 - with multiple stages if you'd like to
12:43 - see a tutorial on any of these specific
12:45 - features please post it in the comments
12:47 - of those combined to make this very nice
12:49 - game you can go down to your own FPS
12:52 - game by using the micro game as a base
12:54 - just go to the unity up open up the
12:56 - learn tab and start modifying the micro
12:59 - game you can very quickly play around
13:01 - without the pre-made prefabs and build
13:03 - some really interesting levels and make
13:05 - your own weapons and enemies so give it
13:07 - a shot and see what you can build also
13:10 - next month there won't be a very nice
13:12 - livestream game jam using the FPS micro
13:14 - game as a base it will be on November 24
13:17 - and it will be hosted by Android from
13:19 - mixing jam alongside myself and couch
13:21 - ferret as well as elena from unity it
13:24 - won't be a very fun livestream so make
13:26 - sure you add the day to your calendar in
