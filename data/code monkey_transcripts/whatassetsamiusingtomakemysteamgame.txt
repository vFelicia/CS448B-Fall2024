01:51 - 10 off alright so let's see what access
01:53 - I'm using to make my sim game a reality
01:55 - the game is still in early development
01:57 - but in order to announce the game I
01:59 - needed to make the trailer which meant
02:00 - that I needed some visuals animations
02:02 - and effects as I've said many times one
02:04 - of the most important things nowadays is
02:05 - standing out you need to stand out both
02:07 - in terms of game mechanics as well as
02:09 - visuals I think mechanically the game ID
02:11 - is interesting enough to send out having
02:13 - lots of interconnected systems mixing
02:15 - many genres but as you might also know
02:18 - I'm not an artist so visuals are not my
02:20 - strong point thankfully visuals are one
02:22 - of the easiest things you can just pick
02:23 - up from the s store
02:25 - so I focus really hard on achieving a
02:27 - good interesting look specifically by
02:28 - utilizing a bunch of interesting shaders
02:30 - I tried a whole bunch of them before
02:32 - deciding on the final look the first one
02:34 - I tried was quibly this one is an
02:36 - excellent anime Inspire Shader it looks
02:38 - really awesome with some very nice
02:40 - flight colors it's extremely
02:41 - customizable you can change the outlines
02:43 - the color bands gradients and so on it
02:46 - can definitely achieve some awesome
02:47 - effects
02:48 - another excellent one that I tried was
02:50 - the flat kid tuned Shader this one is
02:52 - one of the most highly rated nests on
02:54 - the sword again excellent visuals tons
02:56 - of customization it looks really good if
02:59 - you're looking for a cartoony stylized
03:00 - look I can definitely recommend these
03:01 - two assets however with both of them I
03:04 - felt it was a bit too cartoony the game
03:06 - is meant to be fun to play it's not
03:08 - intended to be something super hardcore
03:10 - but still I don't want it to look a bit
03:12 - too chum-like so the next one that I
03:14 - experimented was pixelate I actually
03:17 - used this one in a previous video I
03:19 - bought it from bundle a while ago like
03:21 - the name applies this one helps make
03:22 - your characters pixelated so if that's
03:24 - what you want then it produces an
03:25 - excellent result in my case I did not
03:28 - want it pixelated but thankfully with
03:30 - tons of options you can lower the
03:31 - pixelation to almost zero which makes
03:33 - for a very interesting look especially
03:35 - since you can add some really nice
03:36 - outlines I really liked how this one
03:38 - looked when I made that video a while
03:39 - ago however again the same issue it
03:42 - looks a bit too cartoony compared to
03:43 - what I would like the game to look then
03:45 - I remember that I saw an asset in one of
03:47 - my top 10 list videos use a value I
03:49 - browse my list and found it again it's
03:51 - the screen space cavity and curvature
03:53 - with this one I felt it had the exact
03:55 - perfect vision that I was going for it
03:57 - basically lets you add some more intense
03:58 - shadows and highlights so I've made
04:01 - rounded settings I eliminated the white
04:02 - overlay and just left the thick outlines
04:04 - and with this I think it does look
04:06 - pretty great it looks exactly like I
04:08 - wanted to look it has some thick
04:10 - outlines making everything look slightly
04:12 - cartoony but the colors aren't extremely
04:14 - flat so it doesn't look way too cartoony
04:16 - So based on this my advice to you is
04:18 - spend some time browsing the store and
04:20 - looking at all of the awesome effects
04:21 - that exist to make your game stand out
04:23 - this becomes even more important if you
04:25 - like me are using acid packs especially
04:27 - the Senti packs which are pretty popular
04:29 - using some awesome effects helps make
04:31 - the game stand out even while using some
04:33 - common assets another effect that I
04:35 - wanted was for the building scene I
04:37 - wanted to Showcase building mechanics
04:38 - with a building being constructed I knew
04:41 - what I wanted in my hand something that
04:43 - would sort of 3D print the object
04:45 - I went into the SSR to search and looked
04:47 - at a whole bunch of the solve effects I
04:49 - browse the list and ended up picking
04:51 - this one called the solve and
04:52 - materialize it's a really awesome effect
04:54 - with tons of parameters and settings so
04:56 - you can change it to make it materialize
04:58 - exactly as you want it
04:59 - you can make it noisy make it animated
05:01 - side to side top down or what I wanted
05:04 - which was bottom up it also lets you add
05:06 - colors at various points which was
05:07 - perfect so I was able to easily make the
05:10 - top part of the building low as it's
05:11 - being built I think this effect really
05:13 - came out looking quite well another
05:15 - effect that I used was on the survival
05:16 - scene I wanted the scene sort of at
05:19 - night but it looked way too boring and
05:20 - very static so I added some lights but
05:23 - of course lights themselves only unlike
05:25 - the part where they hit they have no
05:26 - volume so I went into the store and it
05:29 - was great timing because volumetric
05:31 - lights too had just come out it's an
05:33 - excellent really easy to use asset that
05:35 - does the exactly what you expect you
05:36 - just attach the component to your light
05:38 - and it immediately creates the volume
05:39 - then you can play with the settings to
05:41 - get it looking exactly as you want I
05:43 - made the outside a little bit softer I
05:45 - increase the intensity to make it nice
05:46 - and visible and it even includes a
05:49 - really nice particle effect that adds
05:50 - some fun fireflies to your light
05:51 - everything looks really nice so if you
05:54 - have lights in your game and you want
05:55 - them to work quite a bit better I can
05:57 - highly recommend this asset so those are
05:59 - the main effects that I used but of
06:01 - course visuals aren't just about adding
06:03 - extra shaders and effects at its core it
06:05 - all starts with post pressing here is
06:07 - the game with and without post Crossing
06:09 - as you can see it's a pretty huge
06:10 - difference here are all of the settings
06:12 - that I'm using first of all I'm adding
06:14 - Bloom because of course I want some glow
06:16 - if you can't get your objects to go go
06:18 - watch my quick checklist video the next
06:20 - effect is vignette this one adds some
06:22 - Darkness on the corners I like it very
06:24 - subtle I think it looks pretty good then
06:26 - for color grading honestly this is a
06:28 - topic that I really know nothing about I
06:30 - just experiment with these three presets
06:32 - and neutron seems best then for counter
06:35 - adjustments here you can play around
06:36 - with contrast and saturation for me I
06:39 - like to add a little bit of contrast to
06:40 - make the game pop a little bit more and
06:42 - same thing with saturation again I'm
06:44 - going for a more chill atmosphere not
06:46 - something extremely hardcore
06:47 - so adding saturation to make the colors
06:49 - pop just a little bit I think looks
06:51 - pretty great
06:52 - again here it is everything with and
06:54 - without post processing and if you
06:56 - combine it with the effect that I'm
06:57 - using with this you can see a massive
06:59 - difference note how the assets are only
07:01 - exactly the same it's really only a
07:02 - change in effect but you can see how big
07:04 - a change that is so again definitely
07:06 - spend some time playing with post
07:07 - processing and shaders to help your game
07:09 - stand out I would even go so far as to
07:11 - say that you should never leave your
07:12 - game without any post processing at all
07:14 - in terms of particles I just use some
07:16 - bullet particles from this particle pack
07:18 - it's another excellent pack with tons
07:20 - and tons of particles the important
07:22 - particles that I use are some mesh
07:23 - particles which I quite like it makes
07:25 - the blood feel nice and chunky which I
07:27 - think fits the zombies okay so those are
07:29 - the effects but under those effects are
07:31 - the assets as you've heard me say many
07:33 - many times I'm a huge fan of the Cindy
07:35 - style I really like their low poly acids
07:37 - so for this game my very first 3D game
07:39 - it made perfect sense to use them the
07:41 - main pack that I'm using here is the
07:42 - Cynthia apocalypse since the game is
07:44 - post-apocal elliptical with some zombies
07:46 - this was the obvious pack it's a massive
07:49 - pack with thousands of props buildings
07:51 - characters vehicles and just about
07:52 - anything that's where most of these
07:54 - props came in including the zombies
07:56 - although I also use props from several
07:58 - other packs I can't remember exactly
08:00 - which ones I grabbed some things from
08:02 - the heist pack then a bunch more things
08:04 - from the city pack the drones that I use
08:06 - they are from the spy pack then I also
08:08 - picked up a few from the excellent
08:10 - military pack I'll probably be grabbing
08:12 - some more from this pack as I Implement
08:13 - different weapons into the game so
08:15 - basically for the props I just went
08:16 - through every pack that I had and picked
08:18 - out some props that I thought I would
08:19 - need here is a scene that I apocalated I
08:22 - just went through every pack and dropped
08:24 - all the props that I thought I would
08:25 - need dropped them here
08:26 - so you can see I've got all kinds of
08:28 - things so over here is like a
08:30 - Transformer then a bunch of cupboards a
08:33 - bunch of scent traps then some water
08:36 - thing you also got to generate it
08:37 - somewhere some trash some power poles
08:40 - there's some barbed wire a ton of boxes
08:42 - ton of crates so pretty much just picked
08:44 - anything that looked like it might fit
08:46 - the theme of the game then when I was
08:47 - making the trailer scenes I just went to
08:49 - this scene and picked up any objects
08:51 - that I needed and for characters I also
08:53 - picked up some from the city zombie pack
08:54 - and in the future when I make some more
08:57 - interesting zombies I'll probably also
08:58 - grab a few from the boss zombies pack
09:01 - and of course one of the main benefits
09:02 - of using a low poly style is you can mix
09:05 - and match assets from different
09:06 - Publishers so I didn't just use assets
09:08 - from City Studios I browse my assets for
09:11 - some more low poly packs and I said I
09:12 - already owned this pretty massive pack
09:14 - from poly perfect I think I bought this
09:16 - one a few years ago and it keeps getting
09:18 - more and more updates with more and more
09:19 - assets being added so I grabbed a bunch
09:22 - of props from that one and another
09:23 - excellent low poly publisher is an
09:25 - impact Studio specifically for my use
09:28 - case they have some survival packs which
09:30 - fit perfectly so I was able to grab
09:32 - assets from various packs and various
09:34 - Publishers and they all match since they
09:35 - are on low poly this is the main way
09:38 - that I someone with no artistic skill
09:40 - can produce a game that looks pretty
09:42 - great it's all thanks to the SSR which
09:44 - allows me to buy models and effects
09:46 - which I just could not produce myself
09:47 - one thing that was extremely useful in
09:50 - finding and picking all these props was
09:51 - the asset inventory tool this is one of
09:54 - the most useful assets that I've seen
09:55 - basically it lets you search inside
09:57 - every single pack you have without
09:59 - having to import everything into your
10:00 - own project here I've got ENT project
10:03 - and I've got the SN inventory window so
10:05 - I can just search let's say for bucket
10:07 - and there you go look at this look at
10:09 - all the buckets that I have in all of my
10:11 - props all of my Unity packages from all
10:14 - over the place one especially useful
10:16 - thing about this asset is that it works
10:17 - with any Unity package so it's not just
10:19 - limited to the ones you get from the SSR
10:21 - chances are you own some asset tests you
10:23 - bought on a Humble Bundle I certainly
10:25 - have a lot of those and you can easily
10:27 - add those ENT packages to this tool and
10:29 - it will also search inside them it works
10:31 - for finding visuals but also works for
10:33 - literally anything else for the trailer
10:35 - I want to add some extra sound effects
10:37 - to make it sound a bit more interesting
10:38 - and again this asset was super useful so
10:41 - over here I just search for zombie and
10:44 - then on the right side I can select the
10:45 - type so I can select just audio and
10:47 - there you go and look at all of these
10:48 - zombie grones yet another Super useful
10:51 - thing about this asset is how you can
10:52 - preview the sound without having to
10:54 - import the phone pack so I can select
10:56 - any of these and let's say this one and
10:58 - now I can click on the play button
11:01 - and yep that's a sound without having to
11:03 - import it directly into this project
11:04 - speaking of sound most of the effects
11:06 - that I used in the trailer came from
11:07 - this pack it's got almost 10 000 sound
11:10 - effects really an insane amount
11:12 - just with this pack you can find pretty
11:14 - much everything and for the music itself
11:16 - I also checked out tons of songs to find
11:18 - something that fits the main pack that I
11:20 - used was this one the total music
11:22 - collection it's got over 800 music
11:24 - tracks some with loops short versions
11:26 - and more so this was super useful I'm
11:29 - gonna say that for me sound is
11:30 - definitely not my strong point but I'm
11:32 - really happy with how the final trailer
11:34 - sounds I think the music fits and I
11:36 - think these sound effects really add
11:38 - something extra
11:39 - something else that I obviously needed
11:41 - was some animations for General
11:43 - animations I use this basic motions pack
11:45 - it's exactly what you expect you've got
11:47 - some basic animations so I don't want
11:49 - run and so on another good generic
11:52 - animation pack that I've also used in
11:53 - some videos is the everyday motion pack
11:55 - also another nice pack with some general
11:57 - animations for the rifle animations
12:00 - right now I'm still using the same
12:02 - animations that I use in the course
12:03 - meaning they are the free animations
12:05 - that you can download from miximo but as
12:07 - I developed the game eventually I will
12:09 - replace them with some proper motion
12:10 - capture pack
12:12 - possibly from this pack which I already
12:13 - picked up a while ago but for now the
12:15 - three maximum animations are more than
12:17 - good enough another animation that I
12:18 - needed was for the crafting scene I
12:21 - wanted the character to be able to
12:22 - hammer the table thankfully I have a
12:24 - really awesome pack that I picked up a
12:26 - few years ago and still works great it's
12:28 - this crafting mechanism pack features
12:30 - tons of crafting animations with tons of
12:32 - variation it's super useful although
12:34 - that animation actually had some issues
12:36 - basically it was made to work with root
12:38 - motion which I did not want so on the
12:40 - animation itself the feet were sliding a
12:42 - little bit to fix that you need to edit
12:44 - the animation now if you're an animator
12:46 - you would probably do it in something
12:47 - like blender but for me instead I use
12:50 - the excellent view motion asset which
12:52 - lets you edit humanoid animations
12:53 - directly inside Unity this is a fully
12:56 - featured animated tool you can do
12:58 - anything you can do with any animation
13:00 - program the main benefit is you can do
13:02 - it directly inside ENT
13:03 - so especially for making some small
13:05 - changes like the one that I needed it is
13:07 - really super simple you just load the
13:09 - humanoid animation change a few
13:10 - keyframes and that's it another
13:12 - animation that I obviously needed was
13:14 - some zombies there are tons of excellent
13:16 - packs on the store you just search for
13:18 - zombie animations and tons of results
13:19 - come up in my case I'm already on this
13:22 - one some really high quality zombie
13:24 - mocap animations it's got over 100
13:26 - animations with both root motion and in
13:28 - place so this one was the perfect pack I
13:31 - just picked a bunch of animations and
13:32 - used it in my zombies really nice for
13:34 - something else that the game needed was
13:36 - some proper environments and for that
13:38 - the first thing is making a Terrain once
13:40 - again I use the asset inventory to find
13:42 - some terrain textures I found some grass
13:44 - in their textures
13:45 - there are hundreds of excellent texture
13:47 - packs on the store I think the one I
13:49 - used was this one basically just use the
13:51 - terrain tool in order to paint the
13:52 - ground and for the bushes and trees
13:54 - again I used one of the many packs that
13:56 - I picked up some more quote unquote
13:58 - assets that I use were also my own by
14:00 - that I mean things that I made in
14:02 - previous videos on this channel for
14:04 - example for the shooting particles I
14:06 - first made those in the third person
14:07 - shooter video and I just reused that
14:09 - visual here the icons on the atoms these
14:12 - are also icons that I drew previously
14:14 - one of them is from my Red Dead neat
14:16 - system video it's the Deadeye icon then
14:19 - the lightning bolt which is a stamina
14:20 - icon from that's in video as well as
14:23 - just a simple cross Brite same thing for
14:25 - the atoms that I use in the crafting UI
14:27 - I grabbed icons from my previous games I
14:30 - think all of these are from Survivor
14:31 - Squad although the gear icon might be
14:33 - from blueprint Tycoon these are
14:35 - obviously not final icons for any of the
14:37 - items but it's a nice example to you
14:39 - basically you should use whatever assets
14:41 - you have made yourself in the past when
14:43 - you're in the beginning do anything you
14:45 - can to build your first prototype
14:46 - quickly the final category are tools
14:48 - since the game is in early development I
14:51 - haven't used that many tools yet I'll
14:53 - probably be using many of the ones that
14:54 - I covered in my asset review series I
14:57 - did mention the as the inventory super
14:58 - useful I'm also using the excellent
15:01 - Quantum console I made a full review
15:03 - video on it it's a really awesome tool
15:05 - lets you easily create a console in
15:06 - seconds then with that console you can
15:09 - call any function from inside the game
15:10 - so it's super useful for testing things
15:12 - like for example spanning some items or
15:14 - giving some units some extra action
15:16 - points for pathfinding normally I would
15:19 - use the Asar pathwaying project it's an
15:21 - excellent asset that makes your
15:22 - pathfinding pretty much essentially free
15:24 - I could not have made my other Steam
15:27 - games without it for example my game
15:28 - hypernites has battles of up to 2000
15:31 - units doing that with that many units
15:33 - pathfinding requires some really
15:34 - insanely fast pathfinding by using that
15:37 - excellent asset is pretty much how I
15:39 - managed to make that game however for
15:41 - this game since it's turn based I think
15:42 - I probably don't need to use it this
15:44 - time I'm planning to experiment making
15:46 - my own super fast pathfinding with the
15:48 - help of dots it probably still won't be
15:50 - as fast as the ASR pathfinding project
15:52 - but again this one is turn based so it
15:54 - won't probably be more than fast enough
15:55 - perhaps I might use is the Odin
15:57 - inspector for when I start building out
15:59 - some content making the many weapons the
16:01 - enemy stats and so on for all those
16:03 - tasks having a custom inspector will be
16:05 - very useful also the recently released
16:07 - Odin validator it looks really
16:09 - interesting for helping you validate
16:11 - your project I'll probably use that to
16:12 - make sure there are no hidden errors
16:14 - anywhere in the project then when I get
16:16 - to the Polish stage I will definitely be
16:18 - using feel to add all kinds of
16:19 - animations and effects you basically
16:21 - should make every element that the
16:23 - player touches do some kind of animation
16:25 - and feel is an excellent tool for doing
16:27 - just that alternatively I might also use
16:29 - due twin Pro I haven't used this one
16:32 - much but I have heard great things about
16:33 - it it looks really great if you want to
16:36 - do things especially if you want to do
16:37 - it a bit more through code I'm thinking
16:39 - I might do a nested review on this one
16:40 - sometime soon for any 2D elements I will
16:43 - probably be using the all-in-one Sprite
16:45 - Shader it's a really excellent tool for
16:47 - making awesome looking shaders the other
16:49 - great one by the same developer is the
16:51 - all-in-one VFX toolkit I'm thinking I
16:53 - might use this one to make some kind of
16:55 - UI effects and for some more UI polish I
16:58 - might also use shapes
16:59 - this one is a great tool for making any
17:01 - kind of interesting shape and making it
17:03 - nicely animated I've also already
17:05 - mentioned how I'm using umotion to do
17:07 - any small animation edits that I need
17:09 - for the save system I'm still
17:11 - questioning whether I won't build it my
17:13 - own or use for example easy save it's
17:15 - another asset that I've heard great
17:16 - things about although I haven't used it
17:18 - myself of course I won't be using my own
17:20 - mouse cursor system Pro adding a custom
17:23 - cursor is an excellent way to add a
17:25 - little bit of Polish to your game and I
17:26 - made it to almost super easy to use so
17:27 - it will only take a few minutes to add
17:29 - it during the Polish stage then in terms
17:31 - of free Unity tools I'm probably going
17:34 - to use the animation rigging package in
17:36 - some way whenever I need to do some
17:37 - Dynamic animations
17:39 - I'm already using the Ragdoll for when
17:41 - the enemies die I covered Ragdoll in
17:43 - detail in a lecture in my ultimatinity
17:45 - overview course of course I'm using the
17:47 - new input system I'm still questioning
17:50 - whether I won't be able to make the game
17:51 - playable on the GamePad but if so the
17:53 - new input system is definitely going to
17:55 - make that super easy I am of course
17:57 - using send machine to manage all of my
17:59 - cameras and like I mentioned I will
18:01 - probably be using dots for making some
18:02 - super fast pathfinding or really
18:04 - anything else where the game has some
18:06 - performance issues I'm also still
18:07 - questioning if it's possible to add some
18:09 - kind of multiplayer mode if so I won't
18:11 - be using netcode for game objects
18:13 - alongside the various EGS tools like
18:15 - Lobby and relay and another excellent
18:17 - Unity tool that I might use is the free
18:19 - Unity photo mode it's a really
18:21 - interesting package that is free on
18:22 - their GitHub that I've been waiting to
18:23 - look at so with all this as you can see
18:25 - I'm using lots of stuff both free and
18:27 - paid alright so that's pretty much all
18:29 - the assets that I'm using and that I'm
18:31 - going to use in order to build my next
18:33 - steam game hopefully this video helped
18:35 - you see a very practical use case for
18:37 - how you can use assets to make a proper
18:38 - game as you you can see I'm not making a
18:40 - demo I'm not making just a quick YouTube
18:43 - video I'm making a proper steam game
18:45 - with the hope of making it commercially
18:46 - successful and to achieve that I'm using
18:48 - all of these assets a bunch of these are
18:50 - on sale right now with the Black Friday
18:52 - sale so if any of them look interesting
