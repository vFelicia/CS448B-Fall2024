00:27 - it's like someone's okay
00:33 - foreign
04:19 - foreign
04:22 - how's it going
04:24 - all right I'm trying to oh
04:28 - crap I'm hearing myself
04:38 - okay
04:44 - all right I'm also trying to figure out
04:46 - how do I stream onto Steam
04:48 - I've never done this before so just a
04:51 - second
04:53 - uh
05:01 - all right okay I think this should be
05:03 - working
05:06 - hey Super Chat thank you so much all
05:08 - right thank you
05:09 - sorry just a second just trying to
05:15 - okay so I think steam should be working
05:17 - now
05:19 - so if I refresh the page
05:23 - and if there you go let's show up in
05:25 - there alright so that's good
05:28 - all right okay so I think everything is
05:30 - working I'm guessing you can all hear me
05:32 - okay
05:35 - okay
05:41 - all right I think everything is working
05:43 - everything seems correct so
05:47 - just everything that is good good
05:52 - uh yep
05:56 - all right
05:59 - okay just put everything this one over
06:01 - here all right okay good
06:03 - oh did I
06:06 - this is good
06:09 - okay now I'm a bit can oh okay it's just
06:11 - the
06:12 - never mind just the the preview here
06:15 - wasn't was stopped for some reason but
06:17 - anyways all right
06:23 - I assume everything is working
06:25 - it's a preview okay I think it is
06:27 - working all right this is a bit strange
06:29 - because I'm trying to stream to multiple
06:30 - places at once so
06:32 - trying to figure out if everything is
06:34 - working correctly
06:37 - uh
06:38 - all right so I'm going to assume that
06:40 - everything is correct seems correct
06:42 - and okay all right so hey everyone how's
06:45 - it going thanks for being here yeah
06:47 - thank you big daddy Game Dev thanks so
06:49 - much for the Super Chat thanks so much
06:51 - how's your demo doing it's doing quite
06:53 - well actually in terms of wishlist got
06:55 - like 500 wishlists in two days in terms
06:58 - of feedback got a mountain of feedback I
07:00 - still haven't gotten through all of it
07:02 - so if you post a a comment with a bunch
07:04 - of feedback don't worry I'll get to it I
07:06 - try to go as much as possible but yeah
07:09 - there's so much stuff so much awesome
07:11 - stuff so thank you all so much for the
07:12 - feedback that has been super useful so
07:14 - yeah I'm trying to get through all of
07:16 - that I've got my to-do list right here
07:19 - and it's got like a billion things on it
07:21 - so I'm going to try to do a little bit
07:24 - of progress and see how much I can do
07:27 - uh all right so let me try doing a bit
07:30 - of work try to answer some questions
07:31 - just a bunch of things okay
07:34 - so first thing that I would like to
07:36 - implement is the chase mines making them
07:38 - jump up a little bit so let's try doing
07:41 - that
07:42 - okay
07:43 - some more visual scripting tutorials uh
07:46 - probably not I mean ideally I would like
07:49 - to but yeah there's just so many things
07:52 - that I have to prioritize so yeah going
07:55 - for visual scripting I don't think so
07:58 - but it is quite interesting I mean the
08:00 - course that I made in terms of logic
08:02 - that is all still very much up to date
08:04 - so if you want to learn how visual
08:05 - scripting Works definitely go watch that
08:07 - uh okay so let me make the chase mines
08:10 - make them jump up so I'm gonna be first
08:12 - get a nice testing save scene so
08:15 - here I got a scene and let me spawn a
08:19 - zombie by the way if you haven't picked
08:21 - up the demo well of course you can go on
08:24 - to seam and you can go download the free
08:26 - demo uh and if you haven't tried the
08:29 - last version on the last version I had
08:30 - this little debug window so it has all
08:33 - kinds of funny things so this is
08:34 - actually super useful for
08:36 - for developing the game so I can spawn
08:38 - any kind of object I can completely
08:40 - research at experience and so on and I
08:42 - can also spawn the zombie so this is
08:44 - going to be quite useful to test out how
08:46 - I want the chase mines to work so let me
08:49 - see versus Zombie I drop the mine and
08:50 - just go straight basically I wanted to
08:52 - be able to jump up before it actually
08:54 - goes because right now it can actually
08:56 - get stuck on a bunch of these buildings
08:57 - so if I spun another one and if it goes
09:00 - oh why is it only spawning down there
09:02 - that actually doesn't help uh
09:05 - we only try picking up one from here and
09:08 - if I drop the mine there eventually as
09:11 - he approaches or anything okay come on
09:14 - come on
09:15 - there's the mine there
09:17 - and I think it's already yeah it's
09:18 - already trying to move but it can't
09:20 - quite get there because it gets stuck
09:22 - and only after a while it gets so
09:23 - basically I want to make them jump up
09:25 - and then Chase I think that should be
09:27 - quite a nice thing okay
09:31 - then unit testing in unity no not really
09:33 - although I do kind of do test driven
09:36 - development in the sense that I try to
09:37 - make sure that all the code that I write
09:39 - all of it is testable
09:41 - so I don't actually write the tests but
09:45 - I do make sure to
09:47 - make sure that all the code that I write
09:48 - isn't the testable Okay so let me just
09:52 - all right so this is the chase mines
09:54 - let's see one I've got and looking for
09:56 - Target so it's just a basic state
09:57 - machine so look for Target find the
09:59 - Target and I think that this should be
10:02 - quite simple right because I'm using a a
10:04 - rigid body so actually this should be
10:07 - quite easy I should just need put
10:09 - velocity Vector 3 dot up by
10:13 - a little bit let's say 10f that is
10:15 - probably too much but I think that
10:17 - should be all that I need if it goes
10:18 - like this then it should go
10:20 - is it working you see us nope not right
10:22 - now although with the ideas that I have
10:25 - for the final game eventually when I add
10:27 - uh the goal is you basically colonize
10:29 - One Planet you make it fully automated
10:31 - then you go on to another planet
10:32 - colonize that one get a bunch of
10:33 - resources so it has a whole
10:35 - interplanetary network and when I get to
10:38 - that scale I might actually need ECS so
10:40 - I might Implement not actually fall on
10:43 - entities but at least just the uh the
10:45 - job system that I won't probably need to
10:48 - implement that so yeah right now no ECS
10:51 - but in the future you probably won't
10:54 - need to okay so let's see coming from
10:56 - the oh did you all right yeah it did
11:00 - work but it jumped a bit way too much
11:01 - okay so 10 is way too much let's put
11:04 - just five all right
11:07 - future plans with dinky Gardens well I
11:09 - wrote a little bit on the main menu but
11:11 - yeah basically I've got a ton of things
11:14 - so right now the demo is essentially a
11:17 - alpha build of the game so the idea is
11:19 - still to come out in uh around the end
11:22 - of July perhaps August
11:24 - so
11:26 - it's still got quite a while
11:29 - all right so let's see if that mind
11:31 - jumps up as that one gets closer
11:33 - so let's see if it jumps up enough in
11:35 - order to busantly jump over all these
11:36 - buildings in order to be able to
11:38 - actually hit the target
11:40 - okay there and there you go with the
11:42 - jump up all right awesome so yeah I do
11:44 - think that does work okay let me spawn a
11:46 - whole bunch of them and see if they work
11:48 - so spawn a whole bunch of them okay that
11:50 - is way too much but yeah let me pick up
11:55 - and let me drop a bunch of Mines so just
11:57 - throw yeah right because they're already
11:59 - so as soon as I throw it it actually
12:01 - goes up because it's got a bunch of
12:06 - all right but yeah it does work look at
12:08 - that it jumps up so that is
12:10 - all right but that one jumped up but
12:13 - okay but yeah it did all right so yeah I
12:16 - do think just this one change actually
12:17 - works quite well okay great all right
12:20 - awesome
12:21 - game released internally access I'm
12:23 - probably not going to do only access so
12:25 - or I guess the demo over here this is
12:28 - essentially Early Access so I'm keeping
12:30 - the demo even after the festival so I'll
12:33 - keep developing the game and keep
12:34 - updating the demo so pretty much if you
12:37 - go ahead and play the demo please give
12:39 - me your feedback and I will pretty much
12:41 - keep that going probably until release
12:43 - yeah that's pretty much what I won't
12:45 - keep doing okay
12:46 - all right so yeah the chase mine jumping
12:48 - up that was a simple one that was nice
12:50 - okay the other one that I want is the
12:52 - research making it out of progress
12:54 - because that one is actually
12:56 - quite uh quite annoying so once again
12:59 - thanks so much for the Super Chat uh
13:01 - yeah because that one is so if I go if I
13:04 - continue can I go over here into
13:06 - research and I research and let's say
13:08 - the red personal yeah this one is going
13:09 - to take quite a bit so basically having
13:11 - to press e every time is a bit annoying
13:13 - so let's see if I can figure out how to
13:16 - do this
13:17 - uh okay so for this one let me go over
13:20 - here on the player
13:23 - so the active game action okay let me
13:25 - actually go into the research lab
13:29 - so on the research lab because you can
13:31 - finally rest a while yeah I definitely
13:33 - want to I was hoping to rest a little
13:35 - bit this week but I definitely want to
13:38 - take advantage of you know when the when
13:40 - the uh Festival is ongoing so with lots
13:43 - of people playing the game giving me
13:45 - their feedback I definitely want to take
13:47 - advantage of that so yeah it's probably
13:48 - going to be until next week that I can
13:51 - finally rest a little bit hey good
13:53 - morning thanks hello hey thanks for
13:55 - being here
13:56 - okay so for the research yeah I think I
13:59 - just need to make a different one
14:02 - yeah
14:03 - yeah the autoprobe is pretty much just
14:05 - so you don't have to press e every time
14:07 - so basically every time the progress
14:08 - ends I wanted to start automatically so
14:10 - for that reason why I just need to
14:12 - create a new type of action instead of
14:13 - using my generic time action but
14:16 - actually uh
14:18 - because the action part is actually
14:20 - something that I haven't implemented way
14:21 - too much so just a little bit by the way
14:23 - if you want to see the scale of the of
14:25 - the game so here are all of the tons of
14:28 - script monologies that I have for the
14:30 - recipes resource notes all the objects
14:32 - all the things that can be carrying and
14:34 - over here all of the various scripts
14:36 - that make up the game so really quite a
14:38 - lot of stuff and most of this was
14:39 - actually written in the past two weeks
14:42 - so in terms of scale this it was really
14:45 - quite quite insane making making all
14:48 - this work in such a short amount of time
14:50 - but yeah I'm quite happy with the
14:51 - progress okay
14:53 - uh C sharp chords for beginners yes I
14:55 - have my my
14:58 - free course which is started at
15:00 - beginners and intermittent users so if
15:03 - you're a beginner go ahead go through
15:04 - them lots of people have gone and
15:05 - they've really enjoyed it so give it a
15:07 - try okay
15:09 - so I want uh what was the because I know
15:13 - I did some uh player action so I'm gonna
15:16 - get into the player visual
15:19 - uh because I got a yeah The Gather
15:22 - resource section yeah let me just find
15:25 - this one so over here let me find the
15:27 - gather resources action
15:30 - uh right this is DUI so it's not here so
15:33 - down here get a resource section and let
15:36 - me say uh
15:39 - purpose
15:42 - okay uh so
15:45 - research action something like that
15:49 - all right research action
15:52 - okay so we search action
15:56 - and basically I'm going to have yeah
15:58 - it's pretty much the same thing I'm
16:00 - going to have some kind of time let's
16:01 - use the same time so I use 2f so let's
16:03 - go with 2f so research timer and then
16:07 - over here for the
16:10 - research timer Max and yeah pretty much
16:13 - is doing the exact same thing so just
16:14 - Waits a little bit and then ends okay
16:17 - great
16:19 - uh
16:21 - uh you prefer using event handlers in
16:23 - action yeah just to keep with the the
16:25 - standard so yeah pretty much I always
16:27 - use event handlers uh I only use actions
16:30 - when I actually want to delegate not
16:31 - really an event so yeah for the most
16:33 - part I just stick with the standard use
16:35 - regular event action even handlers and
16:37 - yep works quite well uh
16:41 - yeah for the research timer okay all
16:44 - right so basically what I need to do is
16:46 - make sure yeah it's really just this so
16:48 - then I go into research lab instead of
16:49 - creating of that type I created this
16:51 - type and now I don't even have any
16:53 - action primes I don't think
16:57 - okay so now I'm trying to think how do I
16:59 - make the because basically for the
17:01 - player
17:02 - where do I got the active game action so
17:04 - like for example I've got the on action
17:06 - completed
17:07 - and I think I can make it so that when
17:09 - the action completes
17:13 - I can essentially just queue up the next
17:15 - action
17:18 - Okay so
17:26 - all right but I actually need to
17:27 - interact with it as well but actually
17:29 - the lab there's only ever one lab so
17:33 - all right so this actually
17:35 - quite simpler
17:39 - all right so I've got the action
17:40 - completes
17:42 - and yeah I can actually just put it over
17:44 - here so
17:46 - okay so here if the active game action
17:49 - active game action if this one is of
17:52 - type research action
17:54 - then
17:56 - then the player completed a research
17:59 - action
18:01 - and then I'm basically going to start a
18:03 - brand new one so if it is a research
18:05 - action that I'm going to repeat it
18:07 - so
18:09 - repeat the same action
18:12 - and if it is not
18:15 - don't ah
18:17 - don't repeat the action okay so if I'm
18:20 - going to repeat the action I pretty much
18:22 - just need to create a brand new
18:24 - so create a new one
18:27 - uh right how do I
18:30 - because I just do the get and yeah I
18:32 - already know the yeah so I can actually
18:34 - run the exact same code right
18:36 - yep I can actually just run the exact
18:38 - same code so when the action is created
18:44 - so I can just do the active game action
18:46 - the interactive one the interactive one
18:48 - is going to be the not the HQ the
18:50 - research lab there's only ever one
18:52 - research lab so I can just access it
18:53 - like this
18:55 - I just do well let's actually call it I
18:57 - interactable interactable equals the
19:01 - research lab instance as I interactable
19:05 - okay so I've got that one I go into that
19:08 - one get and create the start action you
19:10 - do it get the action
19:12 - and then
19:13 - oh the action complete that's inside the
19:15 - the thing right
19:18 - sorry if I'm not reading chat I'm trying
19:20 - to trying to think a little bit so that
19:24 - is why
19:25 - I happen to use find I previously used
19:28 - to use it quite a lot but nowadays I
19:29 - never use it so nowadays whenever I want
19:31 - to reference I just do a serialized
19:33 - feeling so for example over here the
19:34 - player visual requires a reference to
19:36 - the player animator so I just drag the
19:38 - references directly instead of using
19:39 - fine so yeah nowadays I never do any I
19:43 - never use fine at all
19:45 - okay
19:46 - application generosity made a profound
19:48 - and long-lasting positive impact on give
19:50 - death Community oh that's awesome hey
19:51 - I'm glad I'm glad the videos have been
19:53 - useful to you that's awesome as long as
19:55 - you keep watching I'll keep that I'll
19:57 - keep making them so thank you all so
19:59 - much for being here yeah it's nice
20:01 - why do you cast into interface just so I
20:03 - don't have to rename all these the code
20:06 - is already made to work with an
20:07 - interface so just keep working with an
20:09 - interface uh okay so I think actually
20:12 - like this
20:13 - it should already work
20:18 - oh it's actually good I forgot that I
20:20 - had the tri-start interaction right
20:22 - because I use this for the okay so that
20:25 - actually makes it quite a bit simpler
20:28 - right
20:34 - right yeah
20:36 - okay so this part this might actually
20:39 - make it a bit similar so first I reset
20:41 - it just in case something goes wrong and
20:43 - then I try to start the action that will
20:44 - automatically fire off the event and
20:46 - something okay so let's see if that is
20:49 - working where's my thing down here all
20:51 - right
20:53 - okay
20:55 - you don't need the as interactable uh
20:57 - not up here since it's going to cast it
20:59 - automatically just when I need to kind
21:02 - of things since that one does implement
21:04 - the interface as long as I use it and
21:05 - the function expects an interface it
21:07 - won't automatically cancel okay
21:09 - so let's go down here let's research
21:11 - something let's say ammo let's start
21:13 - researching
21:16 - all right didn't work why did it not
21:18 - work
21:21 - uh okay when the action completes so
21:23 - let's do a debug.log let's see what
21:25 - happened this one is research action all
21:30 - right let's see
21:31 - make a minimap yeah I'm thinking I don't
21:34 - know if I'll make a mini map or just say
21:36 - just saying
21:38 - uh basically just an arrow pointing back
21:40 - to each to the HQ so I don't know
21:43 - because minimap is nice unlike minimaps
21:46 - but
21:47 - right now the UI is already starting to
21:50 - become a bit cluttered so yeah trying to
21:51 - add minimap is going to make things
21:53 - quite a bit more complex okay so it's
21:56 - still using a timed action so I didn't
21:57 - actually change that so research action
22:00 - all right
22:01 - as always basic issue I just forgot to
22:04 - save the file so yeah because this one
22:06 - yeah it's already
22:07 - using that one yeah it doesn't even take
22:09 - any action params no just like this
22:12 - all right that should fix it oh hey
22:14 - Jason enchant hey Jason how's it going
22:16 - nice
22:18 - all right
22:20 - uh
22:22 - using Quantum console in this project
22:23 - yes I am and if you're actually uh if
22:26 - you're playing the demo you can actually
22:28 - access the console I mean right now I
22:30 - made this debug menu so it's not real
22:32 - necessary but if you press shift Escape
22:33 - yep over here is the Quantum console
22:36 - which has been quite useful so I've got
22:38 - a bunch of debug commands that I was
22:39 - using for testing but then I just made
22:41 - this debug window so if you click on the
22:43 - secret little pink button over there
22:45 - everything works quite well
22:47 - uh okay so if I go into ammo let's grab
22:51 - some ammo alright I just forgot the
22:52 - visual video there you go now it does
22:54 - that and I can cancel any time so now I
22:56 - don't have to press e every time I can
22:58 - just press and wait and everything works
23:00 - all right that's pretty good so that
23:02 - should make it a lot more intuitive so
23:04 - that people don't get lost in trying to
23:06 - actually make the action now let me just
23:09 - apply the same visual
23:11 - so the visuals this is still going to
23:13 - require quite a lot of refactoring
23:16 - actually let's use the building
23:18 - construction so for the research action
23:22 - and do I gotta stop one I don't think I
23:24 - gotta stop one nope don't okay great
23:28 - if you work in a game Studio nope just
23:30 - by myself all right let me get rid of
23:32 - the logs no longer need them and
23:34 - actually don't need this code because I
23:35 - can just use the try starting Direction
23:37 - and I also don't need yeah since uh yeah
23:40 - right I don't I can know the active game
23:43 - action and if it is on then I'm going to
23:45 - repeat it and if not then well don't
23:47 - repeat it
23:48 - all right nice okay cool
23:52 - all right
24:01 - challenge you to make a video tutorial
24:03 - without using IF else
24:05 - it's a bit of a weird challenge
24:07 - I mean I I love switches so yeah that
24:11 - could definitely
24:12 - definitely be done uh okay so just
24:15 - making sure that everything still works
24:16 - ah I don't want to pick up some power
24:18 - all right there you go so now it does ah
24:21 - crap
24:23 - was I building
24:25 - no did I put it the wrong way around
24:28 - what did I change
24:33 - oh never mind yeah I'm not very smart
24:36 - yeah
24:37 - uh I thought I didn't need that yeah
24:40 - see this is kind of the issue when
24:42 - writing code on stream
24:44 - which is yeah that's the problem is that
24:47 - my brain if I was working by myself I
24:49 - would see that obviously I needed like
24:51 - this I can't do it the other way but
24:53 - since I'm on stream and my brain is
24:54 - trying to think and talk at the same
24:55 - time
24:56 - things work not very well
24:59 - what is the is keyword you can use that
25:02 - to test if a certain objective is a is
25:04 - of a certain type or implements a
25:06 - certain interface or something like that
25:08 - so in this case I can test if the action
25:10 - that the player is taking if it is a
25:12 - research action if so then I'm basically
25:14 - taking it just like that so
25:16 - basically over here the active game
25:18 - action contains an action so this is of
25:19 - type iGame action and then I'm checking
25:21 - if it is a research action which is an
25:23 - action which implements IEM action which
25:26 - in itself just has a basic interface so
25:28 - start cancel get the progress and so on
25:30 - all right okay so that's another test
25:33 - done
25:34 - uh oh right I still need to save the
25:36 - mines
25:37 - so what I was saying right the research
25:40 - Auto progress
25:42 - and if you want to see how I
25:45 - how I handle my design list there you go
25:46 - super basic I have no idea if the camera
25:48 - can actually see that there you go lots
25:50 - of tasks
25:52 - lots of things I need doing so yep still
25:55 - a lot of work to do okay
25:58 - uh right
26:00 - okay so that is working now what do I
26:02 - want all right I want to save the mines
26:03 - because that's actually
26:05 - that is actually an object type that is
26:07 - not being saved
26:10 - how to use YouTube apri to create a live
26:12 - chat overlay uh
26:14 - affectionately I keep forgetting the
26:16 - link
26:17 - for the thing but
26:19 - there it is so if you go onto this page
26:21 - where you can customize the livestream
26:23 - character if you want and if you go down
26:25 - to the bottom you can see the various
26:26 - tutorials for how I made this live
26:27 - stream feature so basically just
26:29 - involves contacting the YouTube API so
26:32 - you can do that with a basic HTTP
26:34 - request then for the animation for the
26:36 - characters these are mesh based
26:37 - animations and this is basically just a
26:39 - transparent TNT window and then I'm
26:41 - basically tinting and randomizing all
26:42 - the characters so quite a lot of things
26:45 - oh hey Jason sorry is also here hey nice
26:48 - lots of people that's cool
26:50 - uh uh right I guess today is
26:53 - yeah at 7 pm it's actually pretty late
26:55 - for me but I guess it's pretty early in
26:57 - the US so yeah I guess that makes sense
26:59 - all right uh okay so let me save the
27:02 - minds because right now let me just
27:03 - first of all verify the issue
27:06 - throw away change the email uh no but
27:09 - you can either use the contact form to
27:12 - email me and I'll change it manually or
27:14 - you can just create a new account so
27:15 - basically the account is really just the
27:17 - email and password so you can just
27:19 - create a brand new one and everything
27:21 - won't work okay so basically the issue
27:23 - is okay so I put a bunch of Mines then I
27:26 - go I save the file then I go back
27:28 - outside I go in single player continue
27:30 - and nope there are no Minds okay so
27:33 - let's fix them and that should actually
27:35 - be pretty easy I just need to go into my
27:37 - save system and just over here got all
27:40 - of the objects that I'm saving
27:42 - so for the mine
27:45 - uh I think the mine is actually quite
27:47 - simple so yeah pretty much just need to
27:50 - save the position I think
27:52 - so let me actually go into oh crap go
27:55 - into the chase mine
27:57 - let me go inside this one oh so I
27:59 - already added the save
28:01 - I just don't think yeah I just didn't
28:04 - call this anywhere but I already saved
28:05 - it I already gotten loading so I really
28:08 - actually don't need the reference to
28:09 - that
28:10 - okay so this should actually be quite
28:12 - easy so let me go into the save system
28:14 - so first of all let's add some more data
28:16 - to the save objects so let's go into the
28:19 - chase mine and story save object so this
28:22 - is going to be the chase mine save
28:24 - object list
28:26 - then over here I just need to create the
28:28 - list so quite a bit of copy pasted code
28:31 - definitely need to figure out some other
28:33 - way because right now as more and more
28:35 - object types happen this becomes quite a
28:38 - bit more unwieldy but so far it's
28:40 - unmanageable okay so the chase mine and
28:43 - basically just looking for all of the
28:45 - objects that exist in the world trying
28:47 - to find all of their of their types all
28:50 - their things
28:51 - Chase mind save object list then I save
28:53 - that save data okay so that is going to
28:55 - save everything
28:57 - and then down here I just need to load
28:59 - it so just need to go into the chase
29:03 - mine they don't follow these same
29:04 - patterns so quite a lot of copy-faced
29:07 - code but at least it's all pretty much
29:09 - exactly the same so go into the
29:12 - Chase mine load save this one object and
29:15 - yep that should be doing
29:16 - okay
29:19 - dark mode yeah dark mode burns my eyes I
29:23 - can look at it for more than five
29:24 - seconds literally I don't know what is
29:27 - it with my eyes but if I look at the
29:29 - white letters on a black background my
29:32 - eyes cannot focus they get all messed up
29:34 - so that is
29:35 - yeah I really can't do it I can look at
29:37 - it for more than a few seconds it really
29:39 - messed me up all right so let's play
29:41 - some mines here let's go save the file
29:44 - go back main menu continue
29:47 - and if there you go got the mind all
29:49 - right awesome okay great so mines can
29:52 - now save
29:54 - all right so next one I want a dinky
29:57 - spawn indicator
29:59 - okay so how am I going to do this hmm
30:05 - give me one has white letter yeah but
30:07 - it's not it's just a tiny thing so like
30:09 - this doesn't bother me but if it was an
30:11 - entire window all black with white
30:13 - letters yeah that lack of contrast
30:15 - really gets
30:16 - quite messed up
30:17 - [Music]
30:19 - okay so I do that one or maybe the
30:21 - remaining building refund
30:26 - oh how about the energy because the
30:28 - energy actually has
30:30 - yeah over here basically yeah if I spawn
30:34 - the energy I can spawn a massive amount
30:37 - never actually stop so let me actually
30:39 - is this stinky doing anything
30:42 - I guess doesn't matter so well actually
30:44 - if I got since I've got a bunch of debug
30:46 - things let's pick up some more
30:48 - interactive Bots
30:50 - let's build them
30:52 - and put it interacting with that
30:55 - and there you go and build another one
30:59 - actually yeah instead of
31:02 - placing the Bots although that shouldn't
31:05 - have happened I think I just saw a bug
31:08 - so if I'm carrying one of these
31:12 - ideally I shouldn't yeah right why am I
31:15 - inspecting the interactor bot yet it's
31:17 - missing
31:17 - it's missing something there
31:20 - all right
31:22 - so I can go I can interact with it
31:24 - and yep and basically the thing is I
31:26 - want to limit that but first let me
31:27 - actually fix that bug that I just saw so
31:30 - let's save it okay
31:32 - saving players on like you are saying I
31:34 - did make a video on that quite a long
31:35 - time ago and even though the video was
31:37 - made quite a long time that is still
31:39 - exactly how I do things nowadays so
31:42 - saving and loading to a file with Json
31:43 - that is still exactly how I do it
31:46 - nowadays so basically for each of these
31:48 - like for example over here the chase
31:49 - mine
31:50 - so I just create a save object in there
31:52 - I put all the data that I want to save
31:54 - and I just get the save object so that
31:57 - is common over here on the save system
31:59 - so it just Cycles through all the chase
32:01 - mines and gets the save object for all
32:03 - of them so it stores them in that list
32:04 - and then I've got that list stored in an
32:07 - even bigger save object so this save
32:09 - object this is the main save object
32:11 - which then contains all the save data
32:12 - for all the individual objects and then
32:14 - using this save object I just convert
32:17 - into Json which basically converts into
32:18 - text or not saving binary I mean this is
32:21 - a single player game so if you want to
32:23 - hack the the save files to get more
32:25 - resources by all means go ahead that's
32:27 - not really a concern of mine uh so yeah
32:30 - basically just using Json to save them
32:32 - and then bring them back and just
32:34 - loading them and for loading them in
32:36 - this case this one only takes is the
32:38 - position so we're only just going to
32:39 - instantiate a Chase mine on this
32:41 - position and that's really it so yeah in
32:43 - terms of save file that method that I
32:45 - covered in that video quite a long time
32:47 - ago yeah this method is still going so
32:50 - this was in 2018 and yep nowadays I
32:52 - still do pretty much is only the same
32:53 - thing all right
32:56 - generic dictionary yeah that's
32:58 - interesting
32:59 - newtonself does have some weird issues
33:01 - or at least for me usually it has
33:03 - problems with serializing Vector threes
33:05 - it is a very strange thing
33:11 - all right okay so where was I already
33:15 - forget all right the oh right first let
33:17 - me fix that bug so on the interactor bot
33:22 - there was a bug on this one which is on
33:25 - the can interact
33:28 - where is the can interacts here it is
33:31 - uh
33:33 - carry this can interact
33:36 - if it does not have
33:42 - oh it's the
33:43 - yeah because I don't like to see Canon
33:45 - correct alternate
33:46 - so no I need to remember how I uh let's
33:50 - see into the crafting machine
33:54 - so yeah basically let's see I just test
33:57 - if it is carrying something if not then
33:59 - I can't so let's go where's my
34:01 - interactor but not the ey
34:03 - where's the interactor bot script just
34:05 - close
34:06 - can interact alternate there it is there
34:09 - it is this one
34:10 - see if this one is being carried then
34:12 - you cannot interact with it and if the
34:14 - interwriter is holding something then
34:15 - you also cannot inspect this guy this
34:18 - dot name String
34:20 - kind of inspect it while carrying
34:22 - something
34:22 - okay so that should hopefully fix that
34:25 - issue
34:26 - all right
34:28 - binary is just better and more compact I
34:31 - mean that's technically true but these
34:33 - save files right now are 20 kilobytes so
34:36 - that's really not size isn't really a
34:39 - concern right now
34:43 - and yeah if you want to learn more about
34:45 - saving then definitely go ahead and ask
34:47 - Jason sorry go watch his his talk on
34:50 - game that I've done about
34:52 - serialization and decentralization
34:54 - because that's basically that's
34:55 - basically what uh saving and loading is
34:58 - all about just serializing and
34:59 - deserializing data so all right so uh
35:02 - the issue was that I was holding
35:03 - something and I was interacting and
35:04 - right now okay great so that's one bug
35:07 - nicely fixed uh right now the other
35:09 - issue is you have way too much power is
35:11 - being generated so I want to stop that
35:14 - and basically I need to basically I want
35:16 - to do the exact same thing is on the
35:17 - dinky so what did I call it the gather
35:21 - resource node thinking Behavior
35:24 - so yeah over here it tries to find
35:26 - things tries to move the object and it
35:29 - tries to see if it can actually spawn so
35:31 - it does a query in order to find all
35:33 - things so let me go
35:37 - huh
35:38 - where did I add it did I oh that's good
35:42 - oh
35:43 - okay so now I'm thinking
35:45 - yeah because I had it on the interactor
35:48 - thing not the other one
35:52 - okay so this is actually a bit trickier
35:54 - than I thought
35:57 - or maybe not I can actually just go yeah
35:59 - if I go into the
36:00 - uh what did I call it the power
36:02 - generator manual
36:04 - yeah I guess I can just extend the can
36:07 - interact so
36:11 - see how this one is going to yeah try to
36:14 - spawn the power right so I guess just on
36:17 - this one I can do a bowl can spawn power
36:21 - and over here I'm just going to do the
36:23 - basic thing so I'm going to do that I'm
36:25 - going to look for
36:26 - don't look for a carry object how to
36:28 - customize my character follow the the
36:31 - guide on the website you can draw a
36:34 - thing and so on uh
36:38 - okay so Kim spawn power yeah the power
36:40 - is a carry object right yes so I see if
36:42 - it is a carry object then I check if the
36:45 - carry object dot carry object as so
36:48 - if this one equals the game assets
36:51 - instance let's grab the carry object
36:53 - list so and gravity power
36:56 - so it's power
36:57 - so if it is power then do an end so uh
37:03 - Power amount
37:05 - okay and up here Power Plus was
37:10 - and then okay so let's do you know let's
37:13 - call it pretty much the same thing so
37:15 - private const int for the resource
37:19 - object nearby Mount Max let's say just
37:21 - three
37:23 - okay so basically I don't want to spawn
37:25 - more power if there's already at least
37:27 - three of them so if power amount is
37:31 - bigger than that how big or equal to
37:34 - that if so then return false so cannot
37:36 - spawn power
37:37 - and if not then yep everything does
37:39 - works over here return true
37:42 - so on the interact I'm basically going
37:44 - to check if can spawn power
37:48 - so if I can no if I can not spawn power
37:51 - then I'm going to basically return phone
37:53 - so I cannot interact with this and I'm
37:55 - going to need to return a positive game
37:57 - message so this is basically the message
37:59 - that shows up on the interactor UI and
38:02 - for the negative game message let's say
38:04 - something so
38:06 - uh cannot generate power too many
38:10 - already spawned
38:12 - uh it's not a good message only spawn
38:14 - nearby too many already nearby something
38:17 - like this
38:19 - okay so if you cannot spawn the power
38:21 - then he's going to do that and same
38:24 - thing over here for the try spawn
38:25 - interact let's do another check even
38:28 - though this should never cause problems
38:30 - but if you can spawn power then you
38:32 - spawn it if you don't then
38:34 - everyone lose motivation how do you
38:36 - regain it uh the answer is don't hold my
38:38 - own motivation I know that sounds
38:40 - I know that sounds strange oh I've got
38:42 - the power right here I didn't even know
38:44 - that so I can actually use that instead
38:45 - of using the Singleton makes it a bit
38:47 - better uh yeah so basically pretty much
38:50 - motivation is a very uh uncontrollable
38:53 - thing so I would say try not to rely
38:55 - upon it so I would say try to write from
38:58 - a list write a nice student list of
39:00 - everything that you need to do and then
39:01 - just force yourself to do them as long
39:04 - as you really want to achieve the final
39:06 - goal then I would say rely on that
39:08 - instead of actually having relying on
39:10 - motivation which is something that comes
39:12 - and goes but as long as you focus on
39:15 - being professional doing the work as
39:17 - long as you do that then motivation
39:19 - isn't really a factor so for me even on
39:21 - the days when I don't really feel like
39:22 - it I know that if I want to actually
39:25 - finish the game there are a bunch of
39:26 - things that I need to do so I've only
39:28 - just pushed through and finally actually
39:30 - do them so
39:31 - yeah uh all right
39:35 - okay so I think it's already working
39:37 - I've got there's way too many of these
39:40 - of these caps on Bots go away
39:43 - uh let me take it can I tell you to
39:47 - interact with something else no I can't
39:49 - and I can also not yeah that's a bit
39:52 - tricky what tune shade do they use this
39:54 - one is it's called quibly so on the
39:57 - asset store
39:58 - ah crap because I don't have a link to
40:00 - the SSR
40:03 - it's quibly which is this one an anime
40:06 - Shader and looks really nice and has a
40:08 - nice outline so that is actually perfect
40:10 - for the interaction so as I approach
40:12 - something
40:13 - basically just change the outline from
40:15 - black to white and that alone makes it
40:17 - super easy to be able to select things
40:19 - so yeah it's uh pretty nice uh okay so
40:22 - yeah that already works so right now
40:24 - even if I were to disable this one so oh
40:27 - I can actually disable well that's
40:28 - interesting well I can disable that one
40:30 - okay sound is no longer going to pick up
40:31 - anything and these are going to
40:34 - generates some power
40:36 - and now don't generate any more because
40:38 - there's already way too much okay great
40:40 - so now let me just actually use a proper
40:42 - number so I don't know maybe seven
40:45 - seven within radius of five yeah I think
40:47 - that's uh maybe six
40:49 - all right
40:51 - what is this game about it's a nice
40:52 - automation Colony building management
40:55 - game so lots of things
40:58 - right look at that lots of resources
41:01 - whoo
41:02 - okay great so yep that is indeed working
41:05 - so I've got a limit so you can no longer
41:07 - spawn infinite power so that's good
41:09 - uh there was something else which was
41:12 - if I tell
41:15 - what is this one doing adding power
41:18 - well it doesn't really matter doesn't uh
41:20 - let me just
41:23 - is there a dinky over here what is he
41:25 - doing I don't know uh okay so let me
41:28 - tell him to interact with that
41:31 - and basically the issue was
41:34 - yeah I think the issue was with
41:37 - I don't remember there was some issue
41:38 - with this
41:40 - was like spawning the
41:44 - hmm don't debug menu in demo yup it is
41:48 - there so if you go on the right side the
41:50 - little pink button if you're using the
41:52 - very last uh the very last version yep
41:55 - it is right there so I'm asking please
41:57 - let us move items yep I did Implement
41:59 - that on a few buildings so actually I
42:01 - should probably work on that right now
42:03 - but yeah for a few buildings like for
42:04 - example this I don't grab a machine
42:06 - there are now these two so refund that
42:08 - one converts it into the resources you
42:10 - use to make it and if I put back in the
42:12 - capsule there you go picks up a Capstone
42:14 - so now you can pick it up and place it
42:16 - somewhere else
42:17 - so no I just need to actually apply that
42:19 - to all of the other ones
42:22 - uh so yeah let me try doing that
42:24 - basically limit the energy generator
42:26 - okay so that's good
42:28 - all right I also need to sync the dinky
42:31 - Behavior okay
42:33 - uh yeah because that one is going to be
42:35 - a bit tricky
42:43 - yeah for the other ones because how is
42:46 - this one
42:48 - okay
42:52 - so yeah it's the interactive bot that
42:54 - does not have it
42:56 - because I implemented it just on the
42:59 - building
43:00 - this game Loop you are aiming for and to
43:03 - be more of a roguelike
43:05 - no it's more of a longer campaign thing
43:08 - so it's meant to be one playthrough
43:10 - rather than constantly
43:12 - uh going so basically you spawn on a
43:15 - level then you spawn your very first
43:17 - dinky you use that dinky to make more
43:20 - dinkies gather more resources do a bunch
43:21 - of things then do some research then
43:23 - replace the dinkies with automated
43:24 - machines then when the when the planet
43:27 - that you start on when that planet
43:29 - becomes fully fully automated then
43:32 - basically there's going to be a second
43:33 - layer on top where you can go into a
43:35 - second planet colonize that that one is
43:37 - going to have some different resources
43:38 - maybe different dinkies different enemy
43:40 - sort of things so yeah it's pretty much
43:42 - going to be like that so going to a
43:44 - planet colonize it go into another one
43:45 - colonize it mix all the things so yeah
43:47 - something like on the scale of Dyson
43:49 - Sphere program not not quite like that
43:51 - because that's an insane scale but
43:54 - something like that where you got
43:55 - multiple planets and interplay internal
43:58 - Logistics that's pretty much what I'm
43:59 - going for uh
44:01 - okay so let me go into the building
44:05 - uh any upon the building already
44:08 - implemented the put back in capsule and
44:11 - the refund building okay so basically I
44:13 - just need to implement that also over
44:14 - here on the interactor bot
44:16 - which should actually be
44:19 - doable I don't know let me see
44:22 - oh didn't I save this nope okay
44:25 - uh but yeah so basically I've got the
44:28 - put back in the council does this will
44:30 - not have a destroy itself I don't think
44:32 - so
44:33 - no it only has for the carry out oh it
44:35 - does
44:36 - so am I calling this heifer
44:40 - uh
44:42 - oh no I think I just made it as part of
44:44 - the interface
44:48 - oh because this one is a carry object
44:50 - right yeah that's why it implements this
44:51 - one all right okay
44:54 - so yeah basically just need to put it
44:56 - back in capsule and refund building
44:58 - so
45:02 - all right yeah I just need the building
45:04 - caption list so
45:05 - so let me just because this one has a
45:07 - carry object but that's not the capsule
45:10 - right yeah so let me put a building
45:12 - capsule so for the building capsule so
45:17 - all right
45:18 - keep the UI separate not overlaid over
45:20 - one canvas yeah it just makes it super
45:22 - easy to uh to actually work on it so
45:25 - right now all of the UI Windows those
45:28 - are all separated but I've got a super
45:30 - basic script so let me pick one of these
45:34 - got a reset position script all it does
45:36 - really just says just grabs the rec
45:38 - transform and sets the anchored position
45:40 - and size Delta to zero so basically as
45:42 - soon as the game starts all these
45:43 - windows get positioned on the in there
45:45 - but yeah while developing it is really
45:47 - nice not to have all of them overlapping
45:50 - so I don't need to constantly enable and
45:51 - disable things in order to see them I
45:53 - can just position them all over and
45:55 - everything works quite nicely all right
45:58 - you can throw Apple above building is
46:00 - this okay
46:01 - above building sure you can throw it
46:04 - wherever you want
46:06 - uh yeah actually in terms of collisions
46:09 - I do think most buildings actually do
46:11 - have collisions so yeah you can you can
46:14 - have quite a bit of fun with throwing
46:16 - lots of things uh okay so
46:20 - yeah I think that is actually all that I
46:22 - need for this in order to refund the
46:23 - building if I've got the building
46:24 - capsule I can get the crafting recipe so
46:26 - I can get all the contents and if I go
46:30 - yeah I think this one is really just the
46:33 - 22 Force dropping carry object where
46:36 - that I put this yeah I put it on the
46:37 - network despawn and I've got the all
46:40 - destroyed and on any destroyed
46:43 - okay so yeah I'm going to need to
46:45 - implement this because this one yeah
46:46 - this one does not extend that one right
46:50 - so you're pretty much
46:52 - going to need to implement a on
46:54 - destroyed over here and let's also do it
46:57 - on any destroyed and this is a static
46:59 - event
47:01 - so let's clear it
47:03 - and oh I did not make it static uh okay
47:08 - because I need the on network despawn
47:11 - and I don't have any here all right
47:13 - so because I'm going to need to do
47:15 - pretty much the exact same thing I'm
47:16 - going to need to force drop the carry
47:18 - object and then despawn it
47:21 - so yeah
47:24 - all right so basically put back in
47:25 - capsule I'm going to instantiate the
47:27 - capsule I'm going to destroy this one
47:28 - then on this one I'm going to force drop
47:30 - in case this one is carrying something
47:32 - which I don't think this one can
47:34 - actually yeah this one is not a parent
47:36 - so this one
47:37 - fan sure it doesn't it's not a problem
47:40 - okay
47:42 - whichever
47:43 - Contour float over a simple phone I mean
47:46 - if you want it to be a constant then you
47:48 - should make it a constant so over here
47:50 - this max range the range for the
47:52 - interactor bot this is never going to
47:53 - change so yeah pretty much if a value
47:56 - never changes then just go ahead and
47:58 - make it a Content that makes the code
47:59 - quite a bit more clear
48:03 - yep I just need to uh because right now
48:06 - you can directly interact with them so
48:07 - that is the issue but yeah that is also
48:10 - uh I need to make a UI for them in order
48:12 - to be able to do it but yeah okay so
48:14 - anyways I do think this one should
48:16 - already be working so if I go into the
48:18 - interactor.i yeah I just counted this
48:20 - out because I didn't actually finish
48:21 - implementing it but like this should be
48:24 - work
48:26 - I gotta say my voice is not made for
48:28 - constantly talking on the live stream
48:33 - do you go surfing no I'm not very much
48:36 - an aquatic person so yeah surfing
48:40 - swimming not really my thing I much
48:42 - prefer dry land
48:44 - uh okay so let me just go here enable
48:47 - the buttons and technically with that
48:49 - this should be working
48:52 - we need to keep using
48:54 - ugs or use something like Facebook uh
48:57 - I'm not sure I mean so far ugs is
48:59 - actually working quite well I mean the
49:01 - demo has actually got quite a lot of uh
49:03 - quite a lot of people playing it and yet
49:05 - I'm still on the on the free tiers so
49:08 - yeah I think ugs is working quite well
49:11 - so far all right so I go I interact with
49:14 - one of these I put it back in capsule
49:16 - and nope nothing works whether it's not
49:17 - work I got an error okay what's the
49:20 - error all right because I forgot to
49:22 - assign it of course
49:24 - it's always a simple bugs and simple
49:26 - issues
49:27 - uh
49:29 - that's not what I want
49:32 - where's my
49:35 - so the carry object no the interactor
49:38 - bot
49:40 - is it in
49:43 - where did I put it did I make it oh I
49:44 - made it the building object yeah that's
49:46 - why I couldn't find it okay so the
49:48 - interactor bot
49:49 - let me just see if it's over there on
49:51 - that list
49:52 - uh okay so for the interacting I just
49:55 - need to assign the only cap zone for the
49:56 - interactor bot yep there you go just
49:58 - like that that didn't break anything
50:00 - okay great
50:02 - so yep and let me also uh just never
50:04 - pause just so I can easily see the
50:06 - errors because with all of with all of
50:09 - the characters down here it's kind of
50:10 - hard to see the the console down there
50:12 - all right so let's go
50:15 - continue
50:16 - and try to do that so I go up to one of
50:19 - these inspect put back in capsule and it
50:22 - does work except this one did not hide
50:24 - itself so okay so I just gotta fix the
50:26 - UI so how did I do that
50:29 - I can just go into the crafting machine
50:31 - because I did it in the exact same way
50:34 - yeah I basically just need to
50:36 - store the reference and yeah that's it
50:40 - yeah just listen to the event and when
50:41 - the event happens yeah that's how I was
50:43 - that's how I was doing that so up here
50:48 - right because indirect body is not a
50:49 - building that is why this one is not uh
50:52 - so interactor but on any destroyed
50:56 - then go and I'm pretty much going to do
50:58 - the exact same thing so I can actually
50:59 - just copy this if it isn't interactive
51:01 - bot then I'm going to hide it and yep
51:05 - all right so that should fix it
51:08 - okay
51:11 - which Unity on license did you buy I
51:13 - mean right now I've got uh Unity Pro
51:16 - because uh since I'm part of the unity
51:19 - insiders thing they give me a pro key
51:21 - but yeah before that I had the plus is
51:24 - that the name yeah I have the
51:27 - the uh the one above the free so pretty
51:29 - much I mean I think that one is just
51:31 - like 20 bucks a month or something like
51:34 - that so yeah definitely a if we're going
51:36 - to make games and trying to make it
51:38 - professionally then yeah that's a pretty
51:40 - and low cost all right so only does this
51:42 - work so I can do that I can refund it
51:44 - there you go with that a bunch of only
51:46 - oh right I didn't add visuals for the
51:48 - electronics just yet so
51:51 - so yeah this one is just a a green
51:54 - all right that's fun okay great all
51:57 - right so that does work so I can do that
51:58 - one the other one that I needed was the
52:00 - moving object I think I had one up here
52:03 - yeah there's one over there
52:05 - oh this is kind of the issue is that it
52:08 - moves way too fast but yeah okay so I
52:10 - need to do pretty much the exact same
52:12 - thing on the
52:13 - on the moving objects so that's the
52:17 - where's my moving up the carry vehicle
52:19 - and I think I already added
52:22 - yeah I did already add the buttons the
52:24 - other day I just didn't actually
52:26 - because I put out the last update was
52:29 - yesterday at 9 00 PM as I was dying
52:33 - wanting to go to bed so
52:34 - [Music]
52:34 - um
52:37 - all right
52:40 - this game do you expect to sell on the
52:42 - first week uh I think the goal that I
52:45 - put on my I I did talk about my goals in
52:48 - the in the announcement video
52:51 - and the this one right here uh yeah so
52:55 - basically the goal was I actually don't
52:57 - remember what I said what did I say a
52:59 - thousand was that it
53:01 - was my
53:04 - yeah where did I put my
53:06 - final goals
53:09 - where did I put it oh there it is
53:13 - busily my goals for the game so the
53:17 - ideal ones and then the good and the
53:20 - great
53:20 - so yeah basically they only said five
53:22 - thousand wish list that is the minimum
53:24 - which right now is at 2000 which is
53:26 - actually going pretty well so it
53:28 - releases in two months hopefully I
53:30 - should be able to hit at least five
53:32 - thousand so with that I should be able
53:33 - to sell 500 copies and in year one maybe
53:36 - some 1500 and that would make a monthly
53:39 - income of about a thousand bucks so that
53:40 - would be my minimum to consider this
53:42 - success which would be a fun month so I
53:45 - think I'll be able to hit this and who
53:46 - knows perhaps I'll be able to hit this
53:48 - one so that should be interesting all
53:51 - right
53:52 - uh okay what was I doing the carry
53:54 - vehicle
53:55 - so let me go inside my carry vehicle
53:58 - okay so I'm going to need to make the
54:00 - events
54:01 - so what did I call on any destroyed or
54:04 - demolished destroyed okay so on any
54:07 - destroyed
54:10 - and this one equals no and let's make
54:13 - another look on one even though I'm
54:14 - actually not using the local event but
54:16 - yeah sure I guess doesn't hurt
54:19 - say I'm going to do pretty much the same
54:20 - thing so I'm going to obviously need to
54:22 - refactor this at some point in the
54:24 - future after the after the festival is
54:27 - done
54:28 - so I just need the building capsule
54:30 - so just the building capsule put it like
54:33 - that and just for this it should already
54:35 - be working
54:37 - okay so that's good so we just need to
54:39 - assign it yep
54:41 - to write some C plus plus I think I
54:43 - wrote a little bit in in college so a
54:46 - long time ago but yeah never in any
54:48 - serious capacity so I remember
54:52 - I've just seen where I was constantly
54:54 - getting segmentation fonts that was so
54:56 - frustrating back then I didn't really
54:58 - have any skills when it comes to
54:59 - debugging so yeah just seeing and
55:02 - everything segmentation font I had no
55:04 - idea what that meant that was so
55:05 - frustrating that was definitely
55:07 - definitely quite tricky yeah
55:10 - uh okay so building capsule I just need
55:13 - this one to be the carry vehicle and
55:15 - just with that this should only be
55:17 - working let me just go into the UI
55:19 - where's my carry vehicle only y instead
55:22 - of the building on destroyed uh carry
55:25 - vehicle
55:26 - start and then destroy just rename this
55:29 - so carry your vehicle on destroyed like
55:32 - that alright
55:35 - think about the one being Java compared
55:36 - to C sharp uh they're actually quite
55:38 - similar I did I did do quite a bit of
55:41 - java once again also in college that was
55:44 - fun uh yeah Java was was interesting and
55:47 - going from java to c-sharp was super
55:50 - easy
55:51 - so
55:52 - yeah that was a nice transition also
55:54 - before I was into Unity I was making
55:56 - games for several years using Flash and
56:01 - and Flash action script 3.0 that was
56:04 - pretty much the same thing as you have
56:06 - pretty much the same thing as C sharp so
56:07 - that was pretty easy put back in cap
56:09 - Zone and nope why did it not work
56:14 - could I not
56:16 - did I forget to add the right of course
56:19 - I forgot to remove the comment all right
56:21 - used to be Portuguese yep same
56:24 - I mean I live here so yep
56:29 - uh
56:31 - uh okay
56:36 - so UI window workflow like uh
56:39 - during development those are placed all
56:42 - over the place but when the game starts
56:44 - running they all get merged over there
56:47 - and now they're pretty much all disabled
56:49 - so now for example where's the carry
56:51 - vehicle UI so as I approach the carry
56:53 - vehicle and as I interact with it there
56:55 - you go the window enables and is now
56:57 - visible so put back in capsule and now
56:59 - it is hidden disabled any of the rounds
57:01 - so did that work
57:03 - oh yeah it just it just dropped the
57:05 - thing that the vehicle is carrying okay
57:07 - great uh so yeah I can pick it up I can
57:10 - drop it constructed
57:12 - what happened about your squad game what
57:15 - do you mean what happened
57:17 - what happened
57:19 - it was made I don't know uh all right so
57:23 - yeah that does work all right so I can
57:24 - put this one back in the capsule
57:29 - oh man my voice already messed up I have
57:32 - no idea how can people do live streams
57:34 - for several hours
57:36 - I've been
57:37 - when did I start at 6 30 so it has only
57:40 - been one hour and my voice already
57:41 - messed up so yeah
57:43 - is each one a separate canvas nope I
57:45 - just got one canvas and all of these UI
57:48 - elements those are on challenge of the
57:50 - same canvas except for the World objects
57:54 - so for these ones these are all
57:56 - individual separate canvas so for
57:58 - example over here the power indicators
58:00 - each of these objects
58:02 - like over here the interactor bot it's
58:04 - got a worm UI so this is a warm canvas
58:06 - same thing all these are one canvases
58:08 - then the dinkies themselves they also
58:10 - got a bunch of worn canvases so they've
58:13 - got they've got a world UI to show the
58:16 - hunger bar the health bar the other
58:18 - linky and so on so yeah quite a lot of
58:21 - UI stuff all right
58:25 - you make yourself doing you're really
58:27 - active breathe a bit yeah it's kind of
58:29 - tricky too
58:30 - actually Tonk yeah do any work live
58:34 - streaming yeah yeah that is because it
58:37 - is it's definitely a skill so it
58:39 - definitely so I definitely admire people
58:41 - who can live stream and tonk non-stop
58:43 - for hours on end that is really
58:45 - impressive yeah and being able to think
58:47 - and talk at the same time so yeah it's a
58:50 - doing this is quite uh mentally
58:54 - demanding mentally and physically yeah
58:55 - it's a quite tricky say QA streams yeah
58:58 - those are definitely quite a bit easier
59:00 - trying to do I mean it does help that
59:02 - I've got my to-do list in my side so at
59:04 - least I don't have to think about what
59:05 - to do next I can just look at all my
59:07 - tests and figure out which ones work on
59:09 - next Okay so
59:11 - I do think I implemented the caption on
59:13 - all of them
59:15 - so let's see what I do if my character
59:18 - is not how I customize them how did you
59:20 - do that did you add a a custom texture
59:23 - because those need to be uh manually
59:26 - validated so I'm going to see
59:28 - if there's any new
59:31 - uh any new pointer textures okay so I'm
59:33 - going to see that but
59:36 - use Trello nope for project management
59:38 - I've got a text a text object and then
59:42 - I've got a nice basic to-do list super
59:45 - huge on lots of pages that's pretty much
59:47 - how I handle things so yeah don't really
59:49 - use Trello or something like that
59:51 - uh
59:53 - okay what was I doing just look at the
59:55 - other UI figure out if there's any of
59:58 - them that's on this not
60:01 - okay so yeah I think those yeah the
60:04 - waste dispose on the tower the Caribbean
60:06 - actually this shouldn't be called waste
60:08 - I forgot that I renamed that because
60:09 - that one can be used to dispose of
60:12 - anything so that should really be just
60:13 - called disposal all right
60:17 - I mean when we can play Squad game you
60:20 - mean Survivor Squad I mean that game is
60:21 - already out so you can go play it if you
60:24 - want if you want to see what was my
60:26 - very first steam game you can go ahead
60:29 - and play it although gauntlets is the
60:32 - sequel which I'm really happy with how
60:35 - this came out I'm really I'm really
60:36 - proud of how this one happened
60:39 - I do think even nowadays I do think it's
60:41 - an interesting game it's got some
60:43 - interesting mechanics some interesting
60:44 - design obviously visually it's quite a
60:47 - bit subpar but in terms of terms of
60:49 - mechanics in terms of what I built for
60:50 - this game I still really like it so yeah
60:52 - I do still I do still think this game is
60:55 - really nice
60:58 - uh okay so I see a bunch of quite a lot
61:01 - of custom characters let me actually
61:03 - validate them
61:08 - uh right there's another one
61:10 - and I think that's it okay another one
61:14 - yeah because the character validation
61:16 - that is manual so I need to
61:19 - go through the list click the button in
61:21 - order for them to work okay so I think I
61:24 - validated all of them
61:27 - so now let me just now it should
61:29 - download so if any of you over here have
61:31 - a custom character
61:36 - uh
61:39 - okay so I don't know if it didn't
61:41 - download or if
61:43 - the people that made it did not
61:49 - so artem okay I do see that you uploaded
61:53 - one but it's the yeah you need to link
61:55 - your uh YouTube account so that the live
61:58 - stream overlay knows which character
62:00 - blocks you say your character already
62:02 - validated it but it doesn't have the
62:04 - so just go into your user page and Link
62:06 - the YouTube account so that it knows
62:09 - okay
62:10 - uh
62:13 - uh right what was I doing uh
62:18 - uh okay so they only got
62:21 - yeah they cannot oh right there's only
62:23 - ah there's the crate object yeah that
62:25 - one is going to be quite tricky
62:28 - all right fine let me try doing that one
62:31 - quickly so I'm going to need another UI
62:34 - to make it for that one
62:37 - so let's put it up here
62:40 - and I'm going to put this one that's
62:42 - going to call the crate container
62:44 - building UI
62:47 - and inside yeah I'm just going to have
62:49 - the close the refund the capsule this
62:51 - one has no settings no nothing so
62:54 - create container
62:57 - oh crap I can see it sorry uh
63:00 - all right so let me just definitely get
63:02 - one of these just make it easier
63:06 - all right so for the Crave container
63:08 - building UI
63:15 - uh
63:17 - so the correct interior building UI
63:19 - oh crap
63:21 - okay
63:25 - about doing a 3D character that can have
63:28 - different cloth options to wear
63:31 - uh that's a bit tricky there's a I did
63:35 - make I did research that topic a little
63:37 - bit when I made a video on
63:39 - character customization uh customization
63:44 - and there's basically a ton of options
63:47 - that you can take so it can be as simple
63:48 - as just just spawn something on there
63:51 - so
63:53 - it can be just spawning objects but then
63:55 - if you've got skin mesh renders that
63:57 - becomes a bit more complex if you've got
63:59 - bones even more complex so yeah doing
64:01 - character customization there are plenty
64:04 - of options so just research on the
64:05 - option and see which one best fits your
64:07 - game okay
64:09 - so the
64:11 - crate container building UI
64:16 - all right so on this one I don't have
64:18 - that one I've got a close I've got the
64:20 - crate container building for the create
64:22 - container building
64:24 - then I'm going to eventually just do
64:26 - that just do that I register the UI I
64:29 - need the crate container building to
64:31 - implement those events I'm going to need
64:34 - to I can't rename it because it's it's
64:36 - bugged on oh this one all right because
64:38 - that one is a building so that one
64:39 - actually makes that part quite a bit
64:41 - easier
64:44 - so going to down this one for crate
64:47 - container building on any of them
64:50 - open it
64:52 - all right instead of an interactor bot
64:54 - this is all create container building
64:57 - say this kind of thing where it would be
64:59 - helpful if this was instead
65:01 - uh generic script instead of constantly
65:04 - having to rename all of this so yeah
65:09 - uh yeah I don't have any slight
65:11 - interactive ones so I don't have any of
65:13 - this on the update visual I just set it
65:15 - on permanent close I don't have any
65:17 - extra things and so on
65:20 - it's normal Liberation yep the goal is
65:21 - to go back to that in 24.
65:24 - so yeah that is hopefully going to be it
65:28 - should be a fun a fun project that I
65:30 - definitely want to get back to it but
65:31 - yeah it's going to take quite a bit of
65:33 - work so that is why for now I swapped
65:36 - this simpler project
65:37 - even though it's actually been quite
65:39 - quite a lot of work to get this work
65:41 - even though even though it did start as
65:43 - a super simple project uh I wouldn't say
65:46 - that it has gone way too far out of
65:48 - scale but definitely definitely quite a
65:51 - bit uh trickier all right
65:54 - okay so I've got the crate container
65:56 - building so I need the on any open UI so
65:59 - for this one let me go into the uh the
66:03 - crap interact alternate
66:07 - right because I didn't even add that of
66:09 - course
66:10 - of course so let me see it's always easy
66:12 - to remember how I implemented
66:15 - on somewhere else
66:18 - so yeah pretty much you can interact
66:19 - alternate
66:20 - and yeah I can pretty much just copy the
66:23 - exact same options because on this one
66:25 - next on this one I'm never doing an
66:27 - interact alternate so that is going to
66:29 - be
66:30 - interesting to see
66:33 - uh
66:35 - this one is being carried this one can
66:36 - never be carried so that is not an issue
66:38 - if it is holding something then it
66:40 - should be able to yeah so pretty much
66:43 - the contract alternate is always going
66:45 - to work
66:47 - okay I need to make sure that this does
66:49 - not break any of the other logic
66:52 - so I've got the can interact yeah I
66:54 - think I'll
66:57 - yeah I think actually that should be the
66:59 - easiest way so return can interact
67:01 - especially the same condition so if I
67:03 - can interact then I can do the interact
67:05 - alternate so yeah
67:08 - all right so that should work
67:10 - so negative game message okay so they
67:13 - can attract alternate that one works and
67:16 - then I just need the on any open UI
67:19 - when do I call this yeah it's really
67:21 - just the try and try contact that is
67:23 - wrong just all I do I call the UI okay I
67:25 - like that all right so that should be
67:27 - able to trigger the on any opening Y and
67:29 - then on the create containing UI on this
67:32 - one I should be able to open it and all
67:35 - right okay so I think this should work
67:37 - okay
67:39 - make an in-depth dots tutorial anytime
67:42 - soon uh yep I mean right now I'm super
67:44 - busy trying to get this working but yeah
67:50 - next month I definitely want to research
67:53 - dots try to see what has changed and all
67:56 - kinds of things so yeah should be fun
67:58 - still doing the kitchen chaos cars Ah
68:00 - that's awesome I hope you're enjoying it
68:01 - I hope you're learning quite a lot yeah
68:03 - that was a fun game to work on that was
68:06 - interesting I mean I mean that game and
68:08 - the follow-up multiplayer course was
68:10 - essentially what inspired me to make
68:12 - this game so yeah that's a
68:15 - definitely was fun making that course
68:17 - how to make these characters on
68:18 - Livestream I covered the pretty much all
68:21 - these tutorials at the end of this page
68:22 - that covers pretty much how it all works
68:24 - so pretty much is an HTTP request to
68:26 - work with YouTube API then some mesh
68:28 - based animations and this is an entire
68:30 - transparent TNT window so that's pretty
68:32 - much it
68:34 - or to keep up with all new software
68:36 - changes uh pretty much just constantly
68:38 - reading the news so every time Unity
68:40 - announces something I always see it on
68:42 - Twitter or their blog post or maybe they
68:45 - tell me directly on slack or something
68:47 - like that so yeah
68:49 - definitely
68:51 - there's quite a lot of stuff but yeah
68:52 - it's a
68:53 - tricky keeping up uh okay what was I
68:56 - doing I was
68:57 - uh right on one of those kind of yeah
69:00 - way too many testing objects okay let's
69:03 - Place one over here let's build it
69:08 - uh nope
69:11 - oh right because he's gonna say that I
69:13 - cannot interact
69:16 - hmm
69:21 - yeah because on this one you try to see
69:23 - if it is carrying something and if it
69:25 - isn't then it's going to say no
69:29 - ah crap that's tricky
69:38 - hmm
69:41 - ah damn it because I really did not want
69:43 - to be
69:45 - copy pasting all this code I wanted a
69:47 - bit better what do you use for Version
69:48 - Control for me I use the most basic
69:50 - thing possible which is just a basic zip
69:53 - file
69:54 - at the end of every day just make a
69:56 - basic zip file with a project and that's
69:58 - really it I mean since I work solo just
70:01 - by myself there's really no need for
70:03 - anything super complex so yeah for me
70:05 - Super Bass again it works first
70:07 - motivation thank for all the videos oh
70:09 - it's awesome thank you for watching them
70:10 - yeah I'm glad the videos I found you
70:12 - it's awesome thanks uh okay so yeah
70:15 - basically uh the problem here
70:23 - if it is a carrying object parent and
70:24 - carrying something
70:33 - but why do I care if it's a
70:36 - trying to think
70:39 - yeah I guess the other one the I've got
70:40 - the interactor bot and I've got the
70:42 - other one
70:50 - uh okay so basically the problem is
70:55 - whatever the sector is carrying cannot
70:57 - go inside a parade okay so that should
70:58 - not go inside the parade but it should
71:00 - still
71:05 - just always
71:07 - okay let me think
71:10 - yeah because basically the issue is if
71:12 - it is the same type or not
71:18 - so actually
71:20 - um
71:24 - so can interact
71:28 - so if you can interact then obviously
71:30 - just return to the right way
71:33 - if not I think I can still use on those
71:36 - conditions
71:38 - and then
71:39 - just check if crate container so if this
71:43 - one is holding nothing
71:48 - so if this one doesn't actually is this
71:49 - one holding a yeah it is holding a
71:51 - carrier so it has carry object I think
71:53 - like that it should work so if this one
71:57 - yeah if this one is not holding
71:59 - something that I'm going to return true
72:01 - so I can't try to answer it and if it is
72:03 - holding something then I shouldn't be
72:05 - able to interact with this one I think
72:07 - that's
72:09 - I think that should do it okay
72:12 - okay hopefully that works so let's test
72:17 - put a pack from the asset store but it
72:18 - just doesn't work
72:20 - uh you got to be a lot more specific
72:22 - than that I mean if you want someone to
72:24 - help you you can just say it just
72:25 - doesn't work just what does that mean do
72:27 - you not can you not import them can you
72:30 - not see the animations can you not see
72:31 - the assets do you see them in pink do
72:33 - you see them
72:34 - just saying it doesn't work that is not
72:36 - very helpful
72:37 - uh okay right
72:39 - different error what exactly went wrong
72:43 - the Y has been destroyed oh right
72:45 - because I forgot to
72:46 - clear these static events right of
72:48 - course
72:49 - uh or I didn't even
72:53 - no he didn't
72:57 - did I not yeah no oh right
73:01 - well that's on so this should have been
73:04 - breaking something wasn't it okay that's
73:07 - strange
73:10 - on the crate container build
73:12 - okay that's strange that should have
73:15 - been causing some kind of bug before but
73:17 - it didn't
73:19 - okay I guess nothing was listening to
73:21 - that one that's a bit strange
73:24 - all right anyways that should fix it
73:27 - um
73:28 - you play General Zero Hour yep that was
73:30 - an awesome game yeah I loved I love
73:32 - playing generals although Zero Hour
73:34 - itself the expansion I never got too
73:36 - much into it but yeah generals itself
73:38 - was really awesome and playing Red Alert
73:40 - Red Alert 2 that was so cool Tiberian
73:43 - sun was very strange so yeah playing
73:47 - command conquer as a kid was really
73:49 - awesome
73:50 - really fun okay great so just like this
73:53 - already working
73:54 - can go I can refund it any of it works I
73:58 - can pick it up and it even works for
74:00 - things like for example this one which
74:01 - is busy
74:03 - I can take some stuff out interact
74:05 - alternate put back in capsule and yeah
74:07 - now I can move objects with a manual all
74:09 - right awesome
74:13 - for the character when I make an
74:14 - animation controller for some reason it
74:17 - goes in the same state every time
74:19 - state that chosen muscles tab
74:25 - I don't know that sounds very specific
74:27 - to the animation I would say add some
74:30 - debug.logs to see how you're setting the
74:32 - animation parameters and all the things
74:33 - and so on please don't spam come on I'm
74:37 - just by myself don't make me mod chat
74:40 - yes hand only joins yes that is
74:42 - something I would like to eventually
74:43 - cover pretty much just handles ordering
74:45 - objects but yes
74:47 - all right
74:49 - we'll come up to Kitchen chaos yep I
74:51 - would also like to like to cover that as
74:54 - always my issue is just time so yeah
74:59 - all those things I would love to cover
75:00 - them if only I could find the time
75:03 - alright so yeah I do think that all of
75:05 - the yeah just the mining machine Okay so
75:09 - let me just do that one as well yeah
75:11 - because that's the only one missing oh
75:13 - in the fracking machine also needs
75:15 - moving actually right now there was
75:17 - something else that I wanted to do
75:20 - all right I want to check the
75:22 - synchronizing the dinky Behavior
75:26 - so for that I'm going to need to make a
75:28 - build let me just go into the player
75:31 - settings
75:32 - put it on windows so I can test it out
75:35 - okay so let me build and run
75:44 - think about starting a twitch Channel
75:45 - yeah for me I don't really
75:49 - I mean doing live streams those are
75:51 - really tricky so yeah I mean I've been
75:54 - doing this for an hour and a little bit
75:55 - my voice already messed up I'm already
75:57 - really really struggling so yeah I don't
76:00 - see myself becoming a full-time streamer
76:02 - anytime soon so yeah for me streams are
76:04 - just very much sporadic whenever they
76:07 - happen
76:08 - and yeah trying to
76:12 - uh trying to just do the basics so yeah
76:14 - uh
76:17 - uh uh right so I want to test and see so
76:22 - let me if I just continue and on this
76:25 - one
76:27 - oh right it's on this one
76:29 - ah crap I forgot yeah right so for
76:33 - testing I need to change this a little
76:34 - bit so I need to make sure the other
76:36 - scene shows up first all right so that
76:38 - should not work let's make another build
76:41 - like kitchen case now we built the
76:43 - defender oh that's awesome
76:45 - well I hope you'll learn a lot from
76:47 - Kitchen cows that was fun so I hope to
76:49 - learn a lot nice
76:51 - okay
76:54 - all right
76:57 - make a better tutorial at first yep I
76:59 - definitely want to expand upon the
77:01 - game's tutorial there's still
77:03 - quite a bit so yeah right now I
77:06 - definitely do want to expand upon the
77:09 - options okay so I've got a client
77:11 - connected and basically the issue is
77:14 - yeah the client inspects something and
77:16 - it says their own items so it's not
77:17 - currently synchronizing the state
77:20 - okay so let me think how do I solve this
77:23 - so let me go into the dinky the actual
77:27 - dinky script
77:29 - and for the Behavior I've got the active
77:32 - dinky Behavior but I cannot really
77:34 - synchronize this can I
77:37 - actually this is a network Behavior
77:40 - so maybe I can synchronize this
77:43 - huh
77:46 - uh
77:49 - uh okay let's see
77:53 - huh does this actually work I don't
77:56 - think so
77:58 - can I make a
78:00 - a network variable this
78:02 - I
78:04 - oh
78:05 - um
78:07 - because I
78:10 - all right trying to think
78:15 - yeah because this one sets it
78:21 - right I think I'm actually um okay I'm
78:23 - trying to trying to think
78:25 - actually yeah all right no active dinky
78:29 - Behavior index
78:31 - natural variable just natural variable
78:33 - with ends
78:34 - all right so I've got this one and on
78:37 - network spawn let's add a listener on
78:40 - this so I'm probably going to need that
78:46 - so I've got this guy when that happens
78:50 - do I change the uh on the key Behavior
78:53 - changed
78:55 - I guess I could uh
78:58 - I guess I could fire that on this one as
79:00 - well so that the client actually learns
79:02 - about it are you Portuguese yep I am
79:04 - we'll make another q a well I'm trying
79:06 - to work and answer questions at the same
79:08 - time so I'm kind of trying to kind of
79:10 - trying to do both at the same time thank
79:12 - you for kitchen chaos huh it's awesome
79:14 - well you liked it nice
79:16 - General web dev languages would be a
79:19 - good idea to write a server for a game
79:21 - uh maybe but that sounds very strange
79:25 - I mean if I were making a game with
79:27 - dedicated server I would just use Unity
79:29 - for the dedicated trying to do that
79:32 - trying to do a custom web server to
79:35 - handle the dedicated server that sounds
79:37 - real tricky like you would have to
79:38 - translate Unity objects into something
79:41 - in your web server so that would be
79:43 - quite tricky so personally no I would
79:45 - just you I mean technically it is
79:46 - possible you're just throwing bytes
79:48 - around but yeah doing something like
79:50 - this yeah uh
79:52 - [Music]
79:54 - Discord yeah sorry I'm not on Discord so
79:58 - I don't know guys what's this game idea
80:01 - I mean you can go play it right now so
80:03 - the demo is available on Steam nextfest
80:07 - so go ahead and go there and also if you
80:10 - haven't already go ahead and add it to
80:12 - your wish list
80:13 - so I'm basically working on the demo
80:15 - right now trying to keep working out
80:18 - okay what was I doing
80:19 - changing the active index okay so this
80:22 - is the
80:28 - because basically for this one
80:30 - yeah this one doesn't actually
80:34 - so could it be this easy all right okay
80:37 - put this one equals yeah if I'm just
80:39 - going to synchronize the index I can go
80:41 - in there on this index so this new value
80:44 - or let me grab the Active network
80:46 - variable.value
80:49 - so I can just scroll down so debug.log
80:52 - let me do the active linky Behavior
80:56 - on this one so all I need to do is when
80:59 - I modify the active dinky Behavior
81:04 - so when I go on to this one so update
81:08 - behavior that one cancels it and sets it
81:10 - on idle and this one is always going to
81:12 - run the server so like this it should
81:14 - work
81:14 - so I go into the dinky Behavior array
81:18 - can I get an index of oh I can't get an
81:21 - index of
81:22 - I need to do system.array dot index of
81:27 - index of firstly rain then the value
81:29 - which is all the active dinky Behavior
81:32 - rights
81:34 - okay so yeah pretty much just like this
81:36 - so every time that I change the active
81:38 - thinking behavior I'm going to update
81:40 - the network variable so I'm just going
81:42 - to cancel it and it's going to modify it
81:45 - and
81:46 - yeah I think that is the those are the
81:49 - only places where I'm actually saving
81:50 - and setting it all right okay so let's
81:53 - see if the client is receiving those
81:56 - messages
81:58 - okay let's try building and running
82:04 - to your own how to make a transparent
82:06 - window assistant
82:08 - from fiber or telegram I mean I did
82:11 - Cover a transparency window so for that
82:14 - part
82:15 - I do have it it's the same thing that I
82:18 - that I'm using down here for the overlay
82:19 - so that's how you make a transparent
82:21 - window and then for how you contact that
82:23 - I mean you gotta look into their API but
82:26 - it's going to be the same thing that I'm
82:28 - using down here so how to do an HTTP
82:30 - request from Unity so you combine those
82:33 - two with whatever API you want and yep
82:36 - you can build pretty much any
82:38 - interesting overlay you want okay so
82:40 - I've got the demo here
82:42 - let me just start a brand new game
82:46 - okay so let me uh go back in the main
82:49 - menu let's create a new game and on this
82:52 - one let's connect as a client okay so
82:55 - I've got the client connected
82:58 - and now let me open up the console to be
83:00 - able to see things
83:03 - oh crap Network prefab not found this
83:06 - one also
83:08 - no okay so that's strange I'll have to
83:11 - look into that one
83:13 - um
83:15 - right so you got the player ID
83:19 - was Alan supposed to okay so if I go
83:21 - here if I tell you to gather resource
83:23 - nodes from this area go ahead and on
83:26 - this one any of the review did work it
83:28 - did got the gather resource node
83:29 - behavior and if I go into this one I
83:31 - inspect all right awesome okay so that's
83:33 - already working well that's cool okay I
83:36 - didn't expect that to be that easy but
83:38 - it was really just synchronizing a basic
83:40 - end and yeah it worked right away
83:44 - so if I spawn another linking is going
83:47 - to be idle
83:48 - so yep that one is idle and now on the
83:51 - host
83:52 - I'm going to interact with it I'm going
83:55 - to tell it to do something and the idle
83:56 - icon should disappear and start the
83:59 - order any of it does and I go and I
84:01 - inspect yep it is indeed doing that and
84:03 - I can go on this one can I tell them to
84:05 - pick up objects uh well I can't because
84:07 - that one is well tell it to follow me
84:10 - and now if I go into that one and yeah
84:12 - that one is falling all right awesome
84:14 - okay so that works so that's cool
84:16 - all right all right I didn't expect that
84:18 - one to be actually that easy so that was
84:20 - a fun one
84:22 - yeah thank you behavior is nicely
84:23 - synchronized
84:25 - all right
84:28 - okay one more thing that I want to
84:30 - implement the waste chance because right
84:32 - now the game doesn't have too much waste
84:39 - don't you want to work at a game studio
84:40 - with a team not really I enjoy working
84:43 - by myself and over here in Portugal
84:45 - there really aren't many
84:49 - oh well that's fun well so there's a bug
84:52 - that I gotta fix
84:55 - all right so let me add that the noise
84:57 - because that is going to be quite tricky
85:00 - so yeah
85:02 - uh fix
85:04 - dinking
85:07 - Fong Wu
85:09 - player disconnects
85:12 - all right so I'm gonna have to fix that
85:15 - one that is going to be tricky
85:17 - all right for another easy one I need to
85:19 - save the tutorial or even Portugal yep
85:23 - right here okay
85:26 - I want to make a drop down an input
85:28 - field from text mesh Pro
85:31 - but I can't interact with it
85:33 - what do you mean by that being
85:34 - transparent shouldn't be shouldn't stop
85:36 - you from interacting with it as long as
85:39 - the object is
85:41 - uh
85:43 - as long as the object is marked as a
85:45 - raycast Target then you can interact
85:46 - with it whether it's transparent or not
85:48 - in fact that's how you can make
85:50 - basically a blocker image
85:53 - if it's an image and it's got raycast
85:55 - Target enabled then it's going to
85:56 - receive events so yeah
85:58 - oh Elian hey how's it going
86:01 - oh if you've been working on the game I
86:03 - hope it's going well nice
86:04 - become an indie Game Dev oh that is
86:07 - awesome hey I hope it goes well that's
86:09 - cool
86:11 - yeah doing paperwork is tricky but hey
86:13 - that makes it official so congrats
86:14 - that's awesome nice
86:17 - all right
86:21 - [Music]
86:21 - um
86:22 - transparent window I can't interact with
86:24 - the input field do you mean you have an
86:26 - input you have a transparent window on
86:28 - top
86:29 - if you have a transparent window on top
86:31 - and you want the clicks to go through
86:32 - then you do the opposite you go into
86:34 - that window that image and you said
86:35 - raycast Target to false alternatively
86:38 - you can add a canvas roof if it's more
86:40 - than just an image you can add a canvas
86:42 - group and make the entire canvas Group
86:44 - which is going to be this object and
86:45 - whatever it is a channel this and you
86:47 - can disable unbox recast and that will
86:49 - be able to go through
86:50 - any objects in the UI
86:54 - so I'm working on it right now while I'm
86:55 - listening to you oh that's awesome well
86:57 - best of luck with development let's go
86:59 - uh okay
87:02 - all right so I want to save the tutorial
87:05 - because right now I'm pretty sure that I
87:07 - didn't save it
87:08 - uh what did I call the tutorial mention
87:10 - let me just close these windows there's
87:12 - way too much stuff here
87:15 - uh right here the tutorial isn't really
87:17 - saving so I need to save
87:19 - all of this okay that should be easy
87:22 - so let me see the other simple systems
87:25 - that I'm saving what's the closest yeah
87:28 - I guess the tech tree
87:29 - even though this one is actually quite a
87:32 - bit complex
87:35 - yeah the HQ is doing like that yeah okay
87:37 - but let me go into the tech tree
87:40 - click on this yourself nope I picked up
87:43 - pretty much all the assets from the
87:44 - accessor
87:45 - I think the only things that I made
87:46 - myself were yeah pretty much the visuals
87:48 - for the the windows the things but yeah
87:51 - all these visuals so this one is for the
87:53 - Cynthia sci-fi pack the background that
87:55 - is also from the city sci-fi pack the
87:57 - characters are from different one so
87:59 - yeah I'm planning to make a video
88:00 - covering all the assets that I'm using
88:02 - to make the game which should be should
88:04 - be a a fun video should be interesting
88:06 - okay
88:07 - so I need to save and load the tutorial
88:10 - and for that I really yeah this one is
88:13 - an enum so that is actually going to be
88:15 - super simple so that's the only data
88:17 - that I need to save just see the journal
88:19 - stage and nothing else
88:21 - because everything else is already
88:22 - perfect so yeah just the tutorial stage
88:25 - equals the Eternal stage and I don't
88:27 - need any of this
88:29 - so I pretty much don't need
88:31 - any of these
88:33 - uh add an afternoon with action oh
88:36 - that's actually interesting
88:37 - because the way that I was making the
88:39 - tutorial okay so that completes
88:42 - and goes on to the next tutorial
88:47 - all right I don't need I just need to
88:49 - exactly
88:51 - and the activate to turn on that one is
88:53 - going to the so I actually yeah but I
88:55 - should probably do it afterwards in
88:56 - order to prevent any issues
88:59 - so yeah just go into the
89:02 - yeah let's go into the save object and
89:04 - grab the Eternal stage just activated
89:06 - and yep that is going to do that
89:10 - I don't have Super Chat button I don't
89:13 - know
89:15 - are you talking on YouTube I don't think
89:18 - I changed anything so uh how many
89:20 - wishlists are you getting per day on the
89:21 - steam Fest on the first day it was like
89:23 - 300 which was really nice I was
89:25 - expecting something like 150 so again in
89:28 - 300 that was really good and on the
89:29 - second day was 200 so yeah that's really
89:31 - so far it has been really good I mean I
89:34 - was hoping to make
89:35 - uh to get about a thousand wishlists uh
89:38 - for the seam Fest so getting 500 on the
89:42 - first two days that is really cool yeah
89:45 - your FPS course you use some you're
89:47 - talking about the visual scripting
89:48 - course yeah that one is just fully
89:50 - visual scripting there's no code
89:51 - anywhere on that course so yeah although
89:54 - of course everything that is being built
89:56 - there you could definitely do it with
89:58 - c-sharp if you wanted that would be a a
90:00 - fun challenge
90:02 - to be able to go through that course and
90:04 - convert into C sharp that would be
90:06 - interesting so the tutorial manager
90:10 - let me save that so I've got the HQ and
90:12 - for the tutorial manager I'm going to go
90:14 - tutorial manager so I've got an instance
90:17 - have you got an instance okay great
90:19 - so that is going to save all that
90:22 - and just go tutorial manager load the
90:26 - tutorial manager
90:29 - okay so that should really be it so
90:31 - saving the tutorial State should be
90:33 - quite easy
90:37 - you are so good at programming bro not
90:40 - really good more experience I would say
90:43 - uh just because I've been writing code
90:46 - for 25 years so yeah by now
90:49 - it's pretty natural just anything that I
90:51 - any of these sets that I have on my
90:53 - agenda to-do list I know that I have the
90:55 - skills required to actually build them
90:58 - I just need to actually do it so
91:01 - uh
91:03 - yeah so yeah pretty much the answer is
91:05 - always just experience okay so let me
91:07 - craft a quick container
91:10 - all right so let's go although I think
91:13 - yeah I do think that all of these
91:15 - uh tutorial stages
91:18 - according to this math as a programmer I
91:20 - mean just the basics as long as you know
91:22 - the basics that is going to be more than
91:24 - good enough
91:25 - so
91:28 - write this one uh yeah so as long as you
91:30 - know some basic math some basic Vector
91:32 - math pretty much that's all you need you
91:34 - don't need anything complex for me I
91:37 - actually don't remember then I fail in
91:39 - calculus or
91:41 - I think I filmed once and then I made it
91:43 - on the second semester I don't know but
91:45 - yeah complex math is definitely not my
91:47 - thing so yeah you don't need anything to
91:48 - complex just basic algebra basic uh
91:52 - trigonometry whatever it is vectors
91:54 - things that's uh pretty much oh yeah if
91:57 - you want to do super low level graphic
91:59 - stuff then yeah that requires quite a
92:01 - lot more math
92:02 - but if you're just working with UNT just
92:05 - working with an engine they don't really
92:06 - need too much
92:08 - all right
92:10 - uh
92:12 - only this one is not listening to that
92:14 - section like this I do think it should
92:16 - only be working okay so the tutorials on
92:18 - the Staple in the second dinky so let's
92:20 - save the file name go back into the main
92:22 - menu and let's continue
92:25 - and
92:28 - okay that was
92:30 - shh
92:32 - huh
92:34 - okay that went because kind of like
92:40 - uh
92:44 - okay that's a bit
92:47 - odd because I did do the activate
92:48 - tutorial and the tutorial oh I still
92:52 - forgot to add this message let's get rid
92:55 - of it
92:56 - um
93:04 - why did you
93:06 - okay that's strange the tutorial skipped
93:10 - all of these why did you skip all these
93:15 - the function timer didn't load it went
93:18 - into the
93:21 - dinky Behavior which then fired off the
93:24 - event all right
93:26 - hmm
93:28 - okay so that's interesting because
93:30 - basically it's going to
93:32 - all right
93:39 - actually why did you go into that one
93:40 - did I mess up the logs
93:42 - that's a bit strange
93:48 - oh no it makes sense I think
93:52 - yeah he's going in to feed dinky which
93:53 - he shouldn't be but
94:03 - all right because he unloads it right
94:05 - away
94:06 - all right I'm trying to figure out
94:09 - what is he in logic not the active
94:11 - tutorial but the
94:13 - so let's unlock here how's this code
94:16 - compounds so quickly uh I don't know uh
94:19 - sometimes people talk about being stuck
94:21 - in the compilation for minutes and I
94:23 - don't know for me
94:25 - I don't think my CPU is anything too
94:27 - special I think I've gotten like a
94:30 - 5950x
94:31 - which is pretty good don't get me wrong
94:33 - but it's like
94:35 - four years old something like that so I
94:37 - don't know it's it's strange people talk
94:39 - about how their code takes ages compound
94:41 - words for me even on a big project it
94:44 - still doesn't take too long so it is
94:46 - strange
94:48 - okay let me see how is that actually
94:50 - loading
94:52 - trying to make another Unity course yeah
94:54 - sure of course I mean
94:55 - the issue is always finding time to do
94:58 - things but yeah especially one on Unity
95:00 - dots I definitely would like to make a
95:01 - nice one mini project on that so
95:06 - that is definitely something that I
95:07 - would love to have time to do okay so
95:09 - he's going to load
95:12 - but that's not what I now I don't even
95:14 - remember what did I save
95:18 - because I was on the second okay let me
95:20 - make the save file again
95:22 - because I'm
95:25 - because I don't remember what did I save
95:28 - let's save debug download on my tutorial
95:31 - stage just to see what am I Saving right
95:34 - here
95:39 - you can say on the automatically we're
95:41 - unload yeah uh previously it was only
95:44 - reloading when I go but yeah
95:47 - but right now I think it was this
95:49 - version they changed the defaults which
95:51 - annoyed me at first but right now it's
95:53 - actually working quite well
95:58 - video of a problem
96:03 - are you talking about the asset thing I
96:05 - think the best of crap let's not
96:06 - continue I think the best thing is
96:08 - contacting the asset store developer if
96:10 - you're having problems with some
96:12 - specific asset
96:13 - that is probably going to be the best
96:16 - thing skip my question I skipped your
96:19 - question
96:20 - about game architecture that is a very
96:24 - broad topic that is something that is
96:25 - really difficult to cover but yeah uh
96:32 - uh but I did make sure to talk about
96:35 - that quite a lot in my hey Timber Jones
96:37 - hey thanks for being here nice uh but I
96:40 - did cover that quite a lot in my free
96:42 - course so in my 10 hour course I do talk
96:44 - about code architecture quite a lot so
96:46 - if you want to focus on that definitely
96:49 - go ahead watch the course and yeah I
96:52 - talked quite a bit about General
96:53 - architecture things okay so order it let
96:56 - me Spawn that one
96:59 - and I think this is where I yeah okay so
97:01 - I built it and this is where I saved it
97:04 - I think
97:05 - all right so I'm saving on the state
97:07 - clone the second dinky so let's see if I
97:10 - save
97:12 - if I go and it saves clone second leaky
97:14 - okay makes sense so now let's go out
97:16 - let's go back in actually I didn't need
97:19 - to close but okay uh let's go back into
97:23 - the main menu
97:24 - and let's continue
97:27 - and now unloading
97:29 - why did you go back to that one
97:35 - oh never mind right of course
97:38 - what okay now I'm a bit confused
97:46 - oh right because I didn't actually print
97:48 - the thing right because I've got the
97:49 - afterload action so basically spawning
97:51 - on the dinky is automatically completing
97:53 - the first one and then goes into the
97:54 - second one and yeah so on yeah yep it is
97:57 - the Cynthia sci-fi worlds pack yep that
97:59 - is indeed the one all right
98:02 - okay so this is a bit confusing but I
98:03 - think I've figured out
98:05 - face pops up here that I still need to
98:07 - finish the freedom of course yeah
98:09 - definitely go for it
98:11 - how how much you have left definitely
98:13 - take your time go slow just a little bit
98:15 - day by day and
98:17 - soon enough you won't have it completed
98:19 - yeah
98:20 - uh okay
98:22 - I'll beat procrastination
98:24 - procrastinating you with you all right
98:27 - but just make sure that when I finish
98:28 - the stream which will be in about 30
98:30 - minutes definitely go ahead and watch
98:32 - the course follow it for about 10
98:34 - minutes if you do just a tiny bit every
98:36 - single day then even if it takes you
98:38 - sometimes people are like sometimes
98:40 - there are some comments on that on that
98:42 - course people saying something like oh I
98:44 - feel bad because it took me like a month
98:45 - to go through the course and I'm
98:47 - thinking it took me a decade or more to
98:49 - learn everything that course so if
98:51 - you're if you manage to go through the
98:52 - course in one month or two months or
98:54 - three months or whatever you're already
98:55 - doing so much better than me so yeah
98:57 - definitely take your time go slow just a
98:59 - little bit and if you fully understand
99:01 - everything then you will have learned
99:03 - quite a lot so yeah
99:08 - I appreciate it well I appreciate you
99:10 - watching it so thanks for being here
99:13 - all right okay so basically the issue is
99:15 - that I'm loading the tutorial on this
99:16 - tutorial is loading on the Clone second
99:18 - dinky but then as the tutorial unloads
99:21 - that it is going to load that stage so
99:23 - it is going to activate the stage for
99:25 - cloning the second thinking
99:29 - no that actually makes no sense
99:31 - no it does it does make sense
99:33 - yes because it's going to listen to this
99:35 - one which in turn is going to
99:39 - fire off the events okay so one way
99:42 - would be over here instead of completing
99:44 - right away I would have to check for the
99:46 - dinky amount that's one way to do it or
99:49 - perhaps a simpler way you just download
99:52 - this
99:53 - after a little bit just make sure that
99:54 - tutorial loads after the end
99:59 - which actually
100:03 - yeah actually if I just load the
100:05 - tutorial at the very end I think that
100:08 - should solve all of those problems
100:11 - I think so so now it should spawn the
100:13 - dinky go like that and you should no
100:15 - longer skip onto thinking it should go
100:20 - even tell the second one to grab
100:21 - resources oh right because I'm just
100:23 - listening for
100:24 - all right yeah okay so I think this this
100:26 - one fixed it but I think I should still
100:28 - fix the other one
100:31 - how to make a better round game and I'm
100:33 - new on TNT well if you are still a
100:35 - beginner I would definitely encourage
100:36 - you to limit your scope do something
100:39 - much smaller making a battle round game
100:40 - that is a massive scope that's a huge
100:43 - project so I would not recommend that
100:45 - genre for beginners
100:47 - so I would say watch my free course
100:49 - which is a nice
100:51 - easy to learn things so yeah definitely
100:54 - say focus on something much smaller or
100:56 - maybe do something like Flappy Bird
100:57 - maybe Tetris maybe Pac-Man yeah if
101:00 - you're a beginner that's the kind of
101:01 - skill that you should be thinking of
101:02 - instead of instead of a battle round
101:05 - which is quite complex but anyways okay
101:07 - so it worked so here I am calling a
101:09 - second Nikki and yep it did work
101:11 - perfectly so it goes into that one and
101:13 - it wasn't like that and the tutorial
101:15 - state is now correctly saving and
101:16 - loading all right awesome
101:20 - okay so another one so save the tutorial
101:23 - State yep and if you just join you
101:25 - didn't see how do I handle my to-do list
101:27 - where's my camera I don't see hey there
101:30 - you go
101:31 - that's all the all the things just super
101:34 - basic to-do list
101:36 - just like that that really helps beat uh
101:39 - procrastination motivation all kinds of
101:41 - things so as long as I got a list of
101:43 - things to work on I can just go through
101:44 - all these lists
101:46 - and yeah pretty much is complete my
101:49 - tasks one by one
101:50 - all right so yeah my
101:55 - what do you do in your free time I mean
101:57 - I go walk my dogs
102:00 - um
102:01 - I go to gym I go for a run
102:04 - uh
102:07 - uh pretty much it yeah pretty much
102:10 - that's the only free time that I've got
102:12 - I was playing
102:13 - I was playing something and I was really
102:15 - enjoying it but yeah that was like three
102:18 - weeks ago since I since I started really
102:21 - crunching on making this demo getting
102:22 - everything done in time so yeah it's
102:25 - been about three weeks since I touched
102:26 - Zelda so yeah next week when things
102:28 - hopefully become a bit more calm I
102:30 - definitely want to get back to it and
102:32 - hopefully complete the game because I
102:33 - was really enjoying it it's a really
102:35 - interesting game lots of interesting
102:36 - systems so yeah I definitely would like
102:38 - to have some free time to get back to it
102:40 - that should be should be fun
102:45 - uh okay what was I doing so the
102:48 - remaining buildings refund I think that
102:50 - one is working
102:53 - great
103:01 - all right so let me just do the mining
103:03 - waist chance okay because that one is uh
103:06 - so for that let me go into the resource
103:10 - node so
103:12 - okay
103:15 - or is it resource node
103:21 - oh yeah the resource amount for the
103:23 - resource note Okay so
103:27 - uh okay so we're here let me do a float
103:30 - for the waste spawn chance
103:34 - and by default it's going to be zero
103:35 - okay so now let's go for example onto
103:39 - the oh let's say on the player I'll
103:41 - sound on the player actually it's on the
103:43 - shh on the yeah it's on the resource
103:46 - node itself
103:49 - hmm
103:51 - so on the resource node I got a resource
103:53 - node so okay so on Canon tract okay I'm
103:55 - going to do whatever and on try interact
103:58 - oh this was one of the first ones
104:01 - okay come or pressing the search that's
104:03 - control and the uh comma thing so the
104:08 - comma control comma goes into this
104:10 - control all then you can search for
104:12 - types so in order to move between things
104:14 - for example find the player I can find
104:16 - all the references for the player or I
104:18 - can go into the player.cs and it opens
104:20 - up the player file so that is actually a
104:22 - super useful shortcut yeah pretty useful
104:24 - and then control tab for switching
104:26 - between the tabs that is actually quite
104:28 - useful if you do just once it goes back
104:29 - and forth if you go multiple times you
104:32 - can go into learning and you can even
104:33 - click with the mouse that also works so
104:35 - yeah definitely learning how to make uh
104:38 - learning how all the shortcuts work that
104:40 - is quite useful okay
104:43 - uh right so the try interact
104:47 - now the problem is that back when I
104:48 - implemented this I was still still doing
104:56 - okay so basically I want the the let me
104:59 - do it here
105:00 - uh so float for the what did I call it
105:03 - the resource node waste one chance uh
105:09 - okay so boom spawn waste equals
105:13 - random.range
105:16 - so I'm going to randomize between 0 and
105:18 - 1f
105:21 - and
105:22 - so if this one is under the resource
105:25 - node so the always one chance if so then
105:28 - true if not oh just like this yeah oops
105:31 - uh
105:33 - right yeah so the spawn chance if I put
105:35 - it at one then it's going to spawn 100
105:36 - okay so if
105:39 - spawn waste then I'm going to want to
105:41 - spawn some waste if not then I'm going
105:43 - to want to spawn the regular resources
105:47 - okay how old are you I just turned 35
105:50 - about a month ago so
105:52 - that's interesting yeah I guess for for
105:55 - a bunch of people 35 is super old no
105:57 - honestly I definitely don't feel it I
105:59 - still feeling pretty young so yeah
106:01 - definitely
106:03 - it's nice
106:07 - okay it's one way so
106:10 - this one I'm spawning an object and
106:12 - giving it to the parent
106:14 - yeah this is some of the first code that
106:17 - I
106:18 - road so I'm going to need to
106:20 - kind of refactor this way I do think
106:22 - this is the one that it spawns the
106:24 - objects
106:26 - and then
106:29 - adds the oh right it has the explosion
106:32 - Force okay
106:33 - or do I give it to the player no I think
106:35 - yeah all right
106:38 - uh so I go into the I carry objects
106:42 - spawn a carry object and I'm going to
106:44 - spawn of waste so let me go yeah
106:46 - probably store it in the game assets so
106:50 - carry object list spawn some waste on
106:53 - this transform dot position
106:56 - okay so I think that's it that should
106:57 - actually be quite easy all right
107:00 - could not code for game objects uh
107:03 - become limiting in larger size games
107:06 - technically yes I mean they say that
107:09 - it's limited that it's meant for small
107:11 - scale games although I haven't yet
107:13 - tested to see what the limits are I mean
107:15 - right now for the game that I'm
107:17 - developing I actually I don't have it
107:19 - very well optimized meaning all of the
107:22 - tons of
107:24 - name the
107:26 - yeah
107:30 - yeah basically all of these objects
107:32 - those are only networking so there's
107:35 - quite a lot of objects roaming around
107:37 - here and right now everything some Works
107:38 - in multiplayer so I don't know what are
107:40 - the limits they do say small scale but
107:42 - over here I've got I don't know maybe a
107:44 - hundred objects Maybe 15. 50 objects and
107:48 - I've tested it with up to four players
107:50 - and everything still worked quite well
107:52 - so yeah I don't know they do say that
107:54 - it's meant for small scale but so far I
107:56 - have not yet uh encountered the limits
107:58 - of those so so far I'm quite happy with
108:00 - net good for emerge that has been quite
108:02 - well
108:04 - thank you enough for kitchen chaos
108:05 - multiplier oh that's awesome
108:08 - make a working multiplayer third person
108:10 - shooter oh that's really cool hey
108:11 - congrats yeah that's nice
108:14 - yeah congrats on learning something and
108:16 - building upon it that is really awesome
108:18 - that's how you really learn so yeah
108:19 - great job nice
108:21 - uh
108:23 - uh uh okay what was I doing
108:25 - you should make a zoom scroll wheel for
108:28 - this game yeah right now the camera is
108:31 - fixed just because I didn't have time
108:32 - but yeah I definitely want to add a tiny
108:34 - bit of zoom in zoom out I want to be
108:36 - able to rotate the camera that's
108:37 - actually one of the things I've got on
108:39 - my to-do list so you know
108:41 - so yeah definitely want to implement
108:43 - that and what Brazilians
108:45 - nice thanks for being here yeah
108:48 - what time is it in Brazil right now
108:50 - since it's on the other side I assume
108:52 - it's like 3 P.M Maybe
108:54 - sounds nice hey thanks for being here
108:56 - yeah on this random wedding say it's
108:59 - nice
109:00 - about demo is being discovered and doing
109:02 - over on team yep so far it's actually
109:04 - doing quite well I mean in terms of wish
109:06 - lists it got 500 wishlists in the first
109:09 - few days
109:10 - so
109:11 - uh
109:13 - so yeah so far I'm quite pleased with
109:15 - the with the results on things so yeah
109:17 - it has all been
109:19 - it has gone quite well and the response
109:20 - has been great and lots of feedback so
109:22 - thanks for all the people who have been
109:23 - playing to them and giving feedback it
109:25 - has been it has been tricky to keep up
109:27 - with everything there are still a bunch
109:28 - of messages that I haven't replied so I
109:30 - still gotta gotta go back to that so
109:33 - yeah thank you all so much for the
109:34 - feedback it has definitely been
109:35 - extremely useful in terms of adding tons
109:38 - of stuff to my tomatoes yeah right
109:43 - 3 P.M in the US yeah nice
109:47 - uh okay what was I doing
109:50 - research uh research resource notes all
109:52 - right so let me go into my resource node
109:55 - so okay let's see the food let's say the
109:57 - food is going to spawn waste every
109:59 - single time so put it on one
110:02 - all right so let's see if now food
110:03 - instead of spawning food let's see if it
110:06 - spawns some waste
110:07 - hopefully it should which should be fun
110:10 - so let's continue do yeah do pretty much
110:13 - this one so here's some food and if I go
110:16 - let's see anything did work it did spawn
110:19 - some ways so there you go instead of
110:21 - food I grabbed some waste all right so
110:24 - that's a cool mechanic that's exactly
110:25 - what I want to do
110:27 - so yeah if the players on top he gets a
110:29 - bit buggy so maybe I should spawn it
110:32 - a little bit above Maybe
110:35 - yeah let me Spawn it just a tiny bit
110:37 - above so uh when I'm spawning
110:42 - the way so I'm transforming opposition
110:44 - points like the three dot up yeah just
110:46 - got up just one unit that should be
110:48 - enough to do it
110:50 - uh and let me actually play around
110:52 - should the player automatically pick it
110:54 - up uh he does if it is the right thing
110:56 - but for Waste I do think it makes more
110:58 - sense for it to just show up since waste
111:01 - uh is not intended so I do think that
111:05 - not picking it up automatically I do
111:06 - think that is hopefully better so for
111:09 - this one well let's say for food spawns
111:11 - your waist and on the gem green let's
111:13 - say 0.5
111:14 - and let's see what that one does all
111:16 - right
111:22 - running out of water so it's gonna be
111:25 - about time in a little bit okay
111:29 - let me continue
111:31 - hey a custom character hey that's nice
111:33 - that's fun all right let's go
111:35 - that's one oh right did I put zero on
111:38 - the phone yeah right I put zero on the
111:39 - food so it's funny food okay so that's
111:41 - good
111:43 - use a special keyboard mouse uh nope
111:46 - it's all pre-basing although I do have a
111:49 - a little wrist uh thing because I really
111:53 - this keyboard is actually pretty nice
111:55 - it's actually pretty and low profile but
111:57 - still just using it without this this is
112:00 - a very steep angle so I really like just
112:03 - a little rubber thing that really helps
112:05 - like this I can type no problems
112:08 - and the most being Wireless also helps
112:10 - uh really good in terms of making the
112:12 - mouse room light really easy to hold uh
112:16 - right okay so as I do that
112:19 - okay so good news is it worked bad news
112:23 - is why did the dinky
112:27 - seems like the dinky is a dinky
112:30 - oh I think I might have made it
112:33 - essentially
112:34 - uh not go through the interact action
112:37 - let me go into the gather resource node
112:40 - dinky Behavior
112:43 - so this one yeah exactly it's going to
112:47 - gather the resource and then spawns it
112:49 - all right
112:53 - I do think the logic should more be hmm
113:00 - uh right I made that because
113:14 - okay let's do practical test
113:20 - should spawn waste
113:24 - test chance should spawn waste and I'm
113:27 - basically going to
113:29 - do this
113:31 - and if so then you're going to do that
113:33 - if not then you're going to do that
113:36 - so let's make this one public so now on
113:38 - this one I can go into the resource node
113:40 - test shoots one way so if you do that if
113:45 - so then I'm going to want this one waste
113:48 - and if not and let's put it on times two
113:51 - F just make it is only the same and if
113:53 - not then you're going to do that
113:56 - and this one doesn't actually remove the
113:57 - amount right yeah it doesn't okay good
114:00 - uh right
114:02 - okay so now the dinky should also be
114:05 - Gathering waste so let's see if that
114:07 - does happen
114:11 - nightmare fuel Knockouts it was a bit of
114:13 - a
114:14 - strange Sprite
114:17 - uh how did you come up with the dinky
114:20 - name well I actually asked Che GPT so I
114:23 - I talked about that process a little bit
114:25 - in the announcement video
114:28 - so if you want to see how that that came
114:30 - about me I pretty much asked Chachi BT
114:32 - to give me a cute sounding words for for
114:37 - some cute creatures
114:38 - and it generated a bunch of them and one
114:41 - of them was dinky which I thought was
114:43 - quite fun so that was that was
114:45 - interesting
114:47 - all right yeah it's Quantum waste so
114:50 - that's cool
114:51 - all right so that did work now obviously
114:53 - I still gotta design all the things
114:56 - inside the spawn chains obviously these
114:57 - ones are not supposed to spawn waste
115:00 - but this one oh it was a experience belt
115:04 - right yeah yeah I think so because it
115:06 - seemed like it spawned two of them
115:09 - make sure yeah right it's an experience
115:10 - palette yeah but two is spawning a bit
115:13 - too high so I think I'm just going to
115:14 - put one yeah
115:17 - on both them yeah 2f is a bit too high
115:20 - so just put one F even though yeah I
115:22 - guess I can omit it if it's one F hmm
115:27 - I'm lucky best man ever oh I mean it's
115:29 - great download that my videos have don't
115:31 - you
115:34 - only Shadows from image collusion yep
115:36 - that is actually that is true and that
115:40 - is actually a funny thing which actually
115:42 - wasn't funny at all that was actually
115:44 - very
115:45 - frustrating but basically uh
115:49 - so one of the last things that I did
115:50 - before I published the demo was work on
115:52 - the environment
115:53 - so I built the environment out of a
115:55 - whole bunch of things it is actually it
115:58 - is actually one task that I really
115:59 - dislike doing
116:01 - so building this entire map that was
116:03 - really annoying trying to get something
116:04 - but I finally got it working and once I
116:07 - got it working for some reason there's
116:09 - something in the Shader that these
116:10 - environments use that somehow makes it
116:12 - all messed up so
116:15 - so basically the answer was to remove
116:17 - the Shadows uh where do I
116:21 - because that is still a a visual bug
116:24 - that I
116:25 - cannot figure out no right I disabled it
116:28 - on the other one so if I go on settings
116:32 - on the renderer
116:35 - and I cast Shadows
116:37 - so now on this one over here on the
116:39 - editor everything actually still works
116:41 - quite well
116:42 - so
116:44 - if I go in
116:46 - let's go continue spawn
116:49 - and there you go works well so the
116:51 - character has a shadow so I can pick up
116:53 - something I can throw it yep got Shadows
116:55 - perfect but now if I were to make a
116:58 - build and this is the part that really
117:00 - destroyed me now let's see if the bug
117:02 - still happens or not because basically
117:04 - the issue was as soon as I made a build
117:06 - for some reason the build had flickering
117:08 - shadows and I have no idea what was
117:09 - going on and my only answer was really
117:11 - just the only Shadows
117:13 - so let's see if the first if the same
117:15 - thing still happens where's you get the
117:17 - graphics yeah I got them pretty much on
117:19 - from the asset store so I just made some
117:22 - basic Sprites myself everything else
117:23 - just comes from the asset source so yeah
117:28 - would you switch from to these 3D games
117:29 - well the answer is because I learned how
117:31 - to use the assets order that's pretty
117:32 - much it because for me I only know how
117:34 - to draw to the assets so
117:38 - uh so yeah North to move to 3D as soon
117:41 - as I learned that the accessor exists I
117:43 - was able to do that and yep there you go
117:45 - here's the problem so this is why I had
117:47 - to disable Shadows this is a bug that I
117:49 - still have not figured out I have no
117:51 - idea what is causing this it only
117:53 - happens of this if I run on the editor
117:55 - there are no problems no issues nothing
117:58 - but over here on the build
118:00 - I don't know there's something with the
118:02 - normal something with the mesh there's
118:04 - something very strange but yeah the
118:07 - strange thing is really how
118:09 - the editor works perfectly fine here in
118:11 - the shadows everything works great but
118:13 - on the build itself for some reason
118:15 - everything gets messed up the player
118:18 - character the shadow appears and then
118:20 - disappears
118:21 - so yeah very strange graphical bug I
118:24 - have no idea what is going on I'll have
118:26 - to inspect this figure out why is this
118:28 - happening this is very very strange yeah
118:31 - I definitely also hate those bugs that
118:33 - only haven't built I thought everything
118:34 - was working great and then everything
118:36 - suddenly broke
118:39 - what is the graphic quality in the
118:40 - building it's the same one so both are
118:42 - using the exact same
118:44 - uh the exact same render pipeline asset
118:46 - everything is exactly the same so I have
118:49 - no clue no idea why this is happening so
118:51 - I've tried I tried baking the light and
118:54 - it didn't didn't work didn't do anything
118:56 - all these objects are marked as static
118:58 - so yeah
119:00 - yeah I do think it is something in the
119:01 - Shader so I'll have to look into it this
119:03 - is actually pretty complex Shader it's
119:06 - from the it's from the asset pack so
119:09 - it's a trip planner Shader I have no
119:12 - idea if that is what is causing the
119:14 - issues but yeah it is on this Shader
119:16 - because if I use a different Shader and
119:18 - everything works uh without issues so
119:21 - yeah there's something with this Shader
119:23 - on this build that for some reason for
119:25 - some strange reason it just bugs out so
119:28 - so yeah basically that's the answer as
119:30 - to why there's no there's no
119:32 - no shadows in the final game right now
119:35 - yep I did try out the normal bias I I
119:38 - tried changing everything I was spinning
119:40 - from like two or three hours modifying
119:42 - all of these settings all of the things
119:44 - I was changing the distance changing the
119:46 - Cascades over here saying the depth buys
119:49 - the normal base I was modifying all this
119:51 - try tons of stuff and nothing actually
119:53 - worked so so yeah that was something
119:55 - that was really insane I have no idea
119:58 - what the answer is but The Simple
120:00 - Solution is really just disable the
120:02 - Shadows which actually since the game
120:04 - does have the ambient occlusion it
120:07 - actually ends up quite well I don't
120:09 - think I don't think it's too noticeable
120:11 - I mean now that I've mentioned it now
120:12 - you will notice that it's liking quite a
120:14 - bit of Shadows but thankfully for the
120:16 - game the way the camera is set up it
120:18 - doesn't look too noticeable but yeah
120:20 - I'll definitely have to figure out how
120:22 - that is working
120:24 - throw Shadow casting terrain Yep this is
120:26 - not a it's not an actual terrain it's
120:28 - just a just a mesh render with a mesh so
120:31 - yeah
120:35 - ah boy my voice already messed up uh
120:37 - right
120:40 - uh okay so
120:45 - all right so I was just doing that one
120:48 - so the mining waste chance let me just
120:51 - set some basic boundaries and I'll have
120:53 - to balance them
120:54 - and do things
120:57 - whatever this Shadow issue another
120:59 - projects nope never
121:00 - so yeah very very strange thing uh right
121:06 - so the resource node the food should not
121:08 - spawn any chance
121:13 - I came physically
121:16 - oh I got that open okay come on
121:20 - taking it
121:26 - hey
121:29 - give me
121:34 - uh right okay okay baby okay
121:46 - all right okay
121:50 - um
121:51 - right so the food for the gem black
121:54 - motivational dog yeah can our dog write
121:57 - some code maybe I don't know I've never
121:59 - asked her
122:00 - uh okay so
122:03 - yeah maybe the gym black the gem Grand
122:05 - this one is not supposed to spawn any
122:07 - waste and the purple on this one is
122:09 - meant to be quite wasteful so like 0.7
122:13 - then the red let's say 0.4 the envelope
122:16 - let's say
122:17 - 0.2 and the stone also zero okay so just
122:20 - some basic things then I'll have to
122:24 - I'll have to balance all of this all
122:26 - right
122:27 - um
122:29 - okay so I think that's gonna be it
122:31 - because my voice is already messed up
122:32 - and yeah but I didn't manage to do quite
122:35 - a lot of things so yeah the money waste
122:36 - chance that oh actually no actually I
122:39 - don't know that I fully did this
122:43 - uh
122:46 - because there is still the mining
122:48 - machine because since I didn't implement
122:51 - it on the resource node itself it was on
122:54 - yeah it was on this one okay so I also
122:57 - need to implement the same thing on the
122:58 - mining machine so let me just do this
123:00 - and verify things
123:02 - say it's really as simple as that so on
123:04 - the money machine it is going to ask the
123:07 - same question so should you spawn waste
123:08 - if so spawn some waste if not then spawn
123:11 - this end for the mining machine yeah for
123:14 - this one let's put it on the 2f and
123:16 - everything should work okay so let me
123:18 - just verify that the mining machine is
123:21 - working
123:23 - and with that everything's gonna be
123:26 - pretty good
123:29 - I will stuck at constructing Rock I mean
123:31 - it's awesome that he made it that far
123:33 - but yeah the rocket right now doesn't
123:35 - have a a fully uh an end goal so yeah
123:40 - sorry about that but yeah I don't have
123:43 - uh yeah the rocket only has two stages
123:46 - right now yeah that actually reminds me
123:47 - that I should probably I should probably
123:49 - add at least just make it functional so
123:51 - yeah sorry about that I'll try to I'll
123:54 - try to fix that in a little bit uh okay
123:57 - for now let me just focus on this one so
124:00 - I made the that one have a Spanish let
124:02 - me use
124:04 - let me spawn a mining machine so let me
124:08 - pick up one of these craft it and let's
124:11 - see if it goes and there you go it
124:13 - spawns a bunch of waste all right so
124:15 - that's cool
124:17 - all right awesome so it's working on the
124:19 - mining Machines working on the player
124:20 - and it's working on the denkis so I can
124:22 - go into all these and everything works
124:25 - all right let me just go into the food
124:27 - okay okay so yeah actually since I'm
124:30 - here might as well try
124:33 - doing that so
124:35 - yeah basically because it's on the
124:37 - rocket
124:38 - oh I actually did Implement these stages
124:41 - well then it's gym uh for that but yeah
124:48 - so actually yeah I think the
124:52 - uh I think the only issue is that well
124:54 - let me try let me try doing this
124:58 - so only
125:00 - like the main menu let me start a new
125:02 - game
125:04 - and now in fact I'm currently braced on
125:06 - separate lines yeah everyone has their
125:09 - preferred sound for me I quite like them
125:11 - like this but yeah if you like it on new
125:12 - line by all means go ahead and do it uh
125:16 - just follow whatever makes sense to you
125:18 - uh did I not put the rocket here
125:21 - oh I did Capstone rocket we got 99
125:24 - Rockets okay
125:28 - so let's place oh why does the rocket
125:31 - okay that's strange
125:34 - why do you not have a material assigned
125:38 - oh no that's weird
125:42 - oh because I didn't set the
125:46 - didn't I
125:48 - wait why are you even
125:51 - all right because I put it just the
125:52 - black one so okay so let me just quickly
125:55 - fix that and actually I just need to
125:59 - just open up the network prefile just
126:02 - make sure that nothing breaks where's my
126:05 - rocket
126:08 - uh
126:10 - uh so the rocket base is right there
126:12 - just make sure uh okay so on the rocket
126:15 - base send yes to yourself nope I'm using
126:18 - various asset tags because I definitely
126:20 - cannot do I cannot do any visuals myself
126:23 - so
126:24 - yeah I am not uh doing that okay so just
126:27 - on the selected just put the standalized
126:30 - and the selected even though
126:32 - it shouldn't be interactable so that is
126:35 - why
126:36 - pretty much is scalable I mean that
126:38 - depends on the scale uh right now I've
126:40 - managed to get up to something like uh
126:44 - 15 networked objects with four players
126:46 - and everything still works so yeah that
126:48 - really depends on exactly what you mean
126:50 - by scale okay
126:52 - so let me spawn a rocket and some crate
126:58 - containers okay
127:00 - so let me take the Rockets So on the
127:02 - rocket and build it
127:05 - ah crap
127:08 - ah crap did you ah I hate this bug
127:13 - this is an annoying uh net code for game
127:15 - objects bug where sometimes if you
127:18 - modify a prefab for some reason
127:20 - over here on the prefab list for some
127:22 - reason this one goes missing this is a
127:25 - really annoying bug I really hope they
127:26 - fix this this is something that has
127:28 - driven driven me insane for quite some
127:30 - time so for some reason when you modify
127:33 - something sometimes it generates a brand
127:35 - new uh prefab instance prefab thing and
127:37 - for some reason that was on the
127:39 - references so I need to go back to all
127:42 - the objects and drag all the references
127:43 - so I need to put it in there and over
127:45 - here let me find the rocket base and yep
127:48 - I've got a missing prefab so I need to
127:51 - drag the reference and okay I think
127:52 - that's it
127:54 - okay
127:56 - how many years with unity uh I started
127:59 - in uh December of 2012
128:02 - so where are we 23 so I've been using
128:06 - Unity for a bit over 10 years yeah it's
128:08 - been quite quite a while quite some time
128:10 - yeah definitely quite a bit of time
128:13 - how many players have you tried to run a
128:15 - netcode for your Market I've only tried
128:16 - up to four so yeah I haven't done any
128:18 - any serious stresses so yeah that is
128:22 - actually something that I very much
128:24 - would like to do try to push it to the
128:26 - limit to see how far it can go but yeah
128:29 - so far I'm actually quite happy with how
128:31 - it all works it is all I need places uh
128:35 - yeah so far
128:36 - uh yeah the uh the netcode the overall
128:39 - that works quite well okay
128:45 - how old are you and how long in
128:47 - programming uh I've been I start writing
128:50 - code I started writing IRC scripts back
128:52 - when I was 10 years old
128:54 - so if I'm now 35 it's been 25 years so
128:58 - yeah quite a long time
129:00 - quite a long time no inputs have one
129:02 - green Crystal okay so I need to get the
129:04 - green crystals and then the the other
129:06 - ones
129:08 - okay let me let me Spawn some just to be
129:11 - able to see some some green crystals and
129:13 - then I'm going to need I think it's some
129:14 - Stone so let me drop some Stone here
129:17 - some green crystals there
129:18 - on this have control support yep I
129:20 - didn't manage to to make it over here in
129:22 - time for the
129:25 - oh this one also doesn't have a oh it
129:28 - takes food uh but yeah the final version
129:30 - will indeed have Gamepad support so yep
129:33 - there's definitely something that I need
129:35 - to implement okay so let me pick up some
129:37 - food
129:38 - so these interact
129:41 - and okay
129:45 - to put it this way it's difficult or
129:46 - easy to make a decent living out of
129:48 - publishing in the games the answer is it
129:50 - really depends on what this uh decent
129:53 - living mean for you that really is the
129:55 - answer I mean one of the things that has
129:57 - helped me quite a lot is in with the
129:59 - fact that I live in Portugal which is a
130:00 - low cost of living country
130:02 - so when I first started doing this
130:05 - professionally and I was making enough
130:06 - to move out of my parents house I was
130:08 - living on about 700 bucks a month so
130:13 - so yeah if you only need 700 bucks a
130:15 - month to to live then in the game
130:17 - development is actually quite doable but
130:20 - on the other hand if you only live in
130:21 - something like San Francisco and you
130:23 - only and you need 10 grand a month in
130:24 - order to consider it a decent living
130:26 - then yeah at that point it is quite uh
130:29 - quite a lot more different so
130:31 - so yeah the answer is whether in The
130:33 - Game Dev is easy or hard it really
130:36 - depends on your costs the more you spend
130:39 - the harder it is uh
130:42 - okay so basically the logic is working
130:44 - it simply just never completes okay so
130:46 - I'll have to I'll have to come up with
130:49 - something because you know like this let
130:51 - me just inspect the debug
130:54 - uh Network object ID I've got the
130:58 - building capsule and the stage
131:03 - oh stage is undone yeah so I just need a
131:06 - rocket form UI so I need to figure that
131:09 - out
131:11 - um
131:13 - so the rocket
131:16 - World UI all right okay so I'll have to
131:19 - fix that but for now I'm already pretty
131:22 - messed up my voice is going it's almost
131:24 - 9 p.m so ah so yeah definitely uh need
131:29 - to go it's only got to do a lot of work
131:31 - a lot of things but yeah but yeah this
131:33 - was a productive live stream I did
131:35 - manage to do quite a lot of tests so
131:37 - yeah quite a lot of progress
131:38 - I'm just going to clean up things a
131:41 - little bit and put out an update
131:42 - hopefully in the next 30 minutes
131:44 - something like that so yeah that should
131:46 - be interesting
131:49 - situation where you're studying
131:50 - programming but worrying when you are
131:52 - you try to do something you struggling a
131:54 - lot I mean struggling he's definitely
131:55 - part of the learning process so yeah if
131:57 - you if you are struggling with with the
132:00 - learning something that's perfectly
132:01 - normal don't get frustrated just keep
132:03 - going a little by a little all right
132:06 - okay so I'm really all messed up so let
132:08 - me just set things up in order to
132:11 - in order to go close is everything still
132:13 - working on Steam I actually don't even
132:15 - know because I I'm using restream for
132:18 - the first time I assume let me let me
132:21 - actually open up here let me go dinky
132:24 - Guardians if I go onto this theme page
132:26 - is the live stream still there
132:27 - uh yep there it is all right that's fun
132:30 - okay so that's cool so
132:32 - all right so this was the first time
132:34 - streaming on Steam I have no idea
132:37 - what that does what that means
132:39 - I I have no clue who knows maybe some of
132:42 - you came over from Team I don't know uh
132:45 - but okay anyway so yeah uh go ahead and
132:48 - go play the game add it to your wish
