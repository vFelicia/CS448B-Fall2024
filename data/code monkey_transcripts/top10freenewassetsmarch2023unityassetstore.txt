00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the asosaurus full of awesome tones and
00:04 - assets to help me make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:07 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - March 23 in this first video I'll be
00:11 - covering a list of free assets and next
00:12 - ones I'll be covering paid ads and tools
00:14 - let me know in the comments if you pick
00:15 - up any of these and what you intend to
00:16 - do with them by the way right now
00:18 - there's a Humble Bundle with a huge 97
00:20 - off discount on Senti assets there are
00:22 - so many game ideas you could build with
00:24 - all of these maybe you could build a
00:25 - World War II shooter or a plane
00:27 - simulator with war pack maybe even Lord
00:29 - of the Rings inspired RTS with this one
00:31 - then perhaps use the gang Warfare pack
00:33 - to make some kind of tycoon game maybe
00:35 - make your own left for that with the
00:36 - boss zombies you could build something
00:38 - like fallout shelter with the apocalypse
00:40 - Interiors maybe make some kind of Battle
00:42 - Royale with a better round pack or
00:44 - perhaps a songs like with the dungeon
00:46 - pack or really just prototype anything
00:48 - with a very useful prototype pack
00:50 - personally I'm a huge fan of their own
00:51 - low poly style and if you also like it
00:53 - and you want tons of assets with a huge
00:55 - variety for a super deep discount then
00:57 - check it out to the link in the
00:58 - description alright so on to the top 10
00:59 - list starting off with a really nice
01:01 - looking toon Shader there are tons of
01:03 - tutorials out there where you can learn
01:04 - how to build this kind of thing but
01:06 - having a simple free package makes it so
01:08 - much simpler personally I'm always a fan
01:09 - of tune shaders always makes the game
01:11 - look really interesting regardless of
01:13 - what assets you use so if you want to
01:14 - make your games a little bit different
01:15 - then this is a really easy way of
01:17 - achieving them next here is an
01:18 - interesting tool that does exactly what
01:20 - it does it helps you serialize
01:21 - dictionaries this is also something that
01:23 - is quite a bit annoying dictionaries are
01:25 - really awesome but not being able to see
01:27 - them in the inspector is quite a bit of
01:28 - pain usually what I do is I have to find
01:30 - a struct with the key and Valley types
01:31 - then I make a list of that type and on a
01:33 - wake I fill up the dictionary using this
01:35 - really makes that process so much easier
01:37 - next if you want some nice low poly
01:39 - houses here is a nice pack features
01:41 - quite a lot of variation for a free pack
01:42 - looking at this makes me really want to
01:44 - make a quick City Builder prototype just
01:46 - with the road tunnels alone you can
01:48 - really make something quite interesting
01:49 - then here is another interesting tool
01:51 - it's a graph for your object references
01:53 - meaning that you can inspect an original
01:55 - object then that object references a
01:57 - Sprite and another object and you can
01:59 - easily visually see those references
02:01 - it's a very inventive tool I've never
02:03 - seen anything like this so this can be
02:04 - really great if you have tons of
02:06 - references for your objects like for
02:07 - example if you use tons of scriptable
02:09 - objects to hold all kinds of data if you
02:11 - need some VFX here is a bundle with a
02:12 - whole bunch of magic effects they are
02:14 - all excellent quality and quite a lot of
02:16 - variety for a free pack feature some
02:17 - magic circles some auras a bunch of
02:19 - slashes explosions and more adding some
02:21 - excellent VFX is a super easy way to
02:23 - really add some punish to your games
02:24 - this one is a free pack and if you like
02:26 - it then this dev has tons more if
02:27 - instead your game has some weapons here
02:29 - is a nice low poly pack it features a
02:31 - pistol a knife and a rifle all with
02:33 - separated body parts so I think this
02:35 - would be the perfect pack to do a quick
02:37 - prototype on a kind of weapon attachment
02:39 - system by being low poly means you can
02:40 - start from this one as you build your
02:42 - system then you can buy a complete pack
02:43 - to use in the final game this nav has
02:45 - packs with tons and tons of weapons for
02:47 - a really low price up next for another
02:48 - tool here is a simple rest server this
02:51 - one is quite interesting basically you
02:52 - can make Unity into a server which can
02:54 - then receive and respond to http
02:56 - requests and that could be obviously a
02:58 - server on the Internet or it could also
02:59 - be religious localhost if you want to
03:01 - build some tunes just for yourself for
03:03 - example I researched how to do
03:04 - c-sharpening pipes which is quite tricky
03:06 - using this tool would have definitely
03:08 - make that process much easier it looks
03:10 - extremely well built and really easy to
03:11 - use honestly I'm quite surprised that
03:13 - this is free if it helps you may not
03:14 - look into picking up one of the paid
03:16 - assets to support this stuff if you have
03:18 - a 2d side roller then look at this robot
03:20 - pretty nice character with some separate
03:22 - body parts and multiple weapons so this
03:24 - would be a great starting point for a
03:25 - size rolling shooter then for another
03:27 - tool here is simple atoms this one
03:29 - appears to be an implementation of that
03:31 - famous Unity script object song it
03:33 - supports variables events and listeners
03:35 - so you make a swordball object and you
03:37 - can easily link up logic by linking that
03:39 - object it's an interesting pattern one
03:40 - that is more designer friendly than just
03:42 - linking up regular events and if you're
03:44 - making a cute game look at this Sparrow
03:46 - very tiny very cute quirky character it
03:48 - includes the character and 18 animations
03:50 - as usual if you like this style then
03:52 - this dev has tons more alright so those
03:53 - are my top 10 free new assets on the NTS
03:56 - store for March 23. there's links are in
03:58 - the description and also check out my
