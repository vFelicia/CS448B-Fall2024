01:10 - video really makes it look more than
01:12 - perfect I just finished watching
01:13 - chainsaw man the other day and this
01:14 - would definitely fit there it's all
01:16 - based on much more pieces so you can
01:17 - build your own Japanese Village then for
01:19 - a bunch of VFX here is a nice casual
01:21 - pack in total 126 effects so you've got
01:24 - lots of Airy effects a bunch of fire fog
01:26 - loot projectiles regen and a bunch more
01:28 - next here are some high-end Cliffs these
01:31 - look like they could be taken straight
01:32 - from Skyrim if your game has a realistic
01:34 - style and lots of mountains you can
01:36 - definitely Place tons of these around to
01:37 - really populate your world or maybe your
01:39 - game is low probably if so look at this
01:41 - armor pack in total almost 600 modular
01:43 - armor parts this one is an expansion
01:45 - which works with either the paid base
01:47 - pack or the free base pack it's all in a
01:49 - really nice style I quite like the asses
01:51 - from this publisher then if your game is
01:53 - sci-fi and you need some backgrounds
01:54 - look at this one features some super
01:56 - high res textures all of them in 8k it
01:58 - includes a Shader so you can play around
01:59 - with some nice atmosphere effects for
02:02 - something quite a lot more Jolly here is
02:03 - a gorgeous puppy it's a German Shepherd

02:07 - really nice model with 75 animations and
02:10 - it also includes accessories like colors
02:12 - footballs and a bunch of toys maybe
02:13 - you're working on a card game if so look
02:15 - at this pink Shader you can easily add
02:17 - some rain effects add some snow and some
02:19 - dirt you can add some particle Nas and a
02:21 - bunch of decals there is an atrp version
02:23 - and a urp version then if you're working
02:25 - on a survival game and you need tons of
02:27 - props look at this Mega kit I'm using a
02:29 - similar kit from the same publisher in
02:31 - my own game turn one Liberation by the

02:41 - bunch more next here is an interesting
02:43 - scene it's a big room with a huge Globe
02:45 - some nice windows and a chair the first
02:47 - thing that comes to mind is this would
02:48 - be a great location for some kind of fun
02:50 - on boss fight maybe in a game inspired
02:52 - by either 007 or Austin Powers
02:54 - definitely a bit of a strange asset but
02:56 - it doesn't look great next if you need a
02:58 - bunch of weird fantasy monsters check
02:59 - this one out it includes eight unique
03:01 - monsters all of them pretty strange

03:09 - poly check out this interior and food
03:11 - bundle these are very simple assets but
03:13 - this pack has a massive amount of them I
03:15 - can see this one being perfect for
03:17 - either some kind of game kind of like
03:18 - the Sims or maybe something like a
03:20 - kitchen game possibly in VR then for a
03:22 - really fun effect that players always
