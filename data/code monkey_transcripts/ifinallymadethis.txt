00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your codm and I
00:02 - finally made something that I've wanted
00:04 - to do for a real long time now if you've
00:06 - been following the channel for a while
00:07 - you might have seen me post some of
00:08 - these questions these are some
00:10 - interesting multi-choice questions that
00:11 - every once in a while I would post on
00:12 - the community time I think this is an
00:15 - easy fun way to learn and I definitely
00:16 - would like to do some more of these by
00:18 - answering some questions and then
00:19 - reading the detailed answer with all the
00:21 - links by doing that you can really learn
00:23 - in a really nice fun way so I've always
00:25 - wanted to make this a more regular thing
00:27 - but when I post these this was all just
00:29 - an entire men ual process and
00:31 - considering how always so busy working
00:32 - on so many things at the same time I
00:34 - really couldn't find the time to
00:35 - constantly post this so the goal that
00:37 - I've had for literally years at this
00:38 - point was to Simply automate this
00:40 - process and lately I finally found some
00:42 - time and I've been exactly working on
00:43 - this project on my website I made a
00:45 - really nice system where every 3 days a
00:47 - new question is selected automatically
00:49 - this is picked randomly from the list of
00:51 - questions so it's also fun for me since
00:52 - I wrote a ton of questions and I don't
00:54 - remember half of them questions like for
00:56 - example over here what is the equivalent
00:58 - to input get mouse button down on new
01:00 - input system package so is it input
01:02 - system. getet Mouse button down or is it
01:04 - mouse. current. left button was presses
01:06 - frame or is it player input. Mouse read
01:09 - value of bone so if you want to answer
01:10 - take a few seconds and try to answer so
01:12 - in my case I'm pretty sure I know the
01:14 - answer and I'm pretty sure that it's
01:15 - this one and yep I was thankfully
01:17 - correct like it says here the new input
01:19 - system is awesome and a lot more capable
01:20 - although that comes at the cost of
01:21 - increased complexity so doing something
01:23 - like a simple button check that is super
01:25 - easy in the input manager but not many
01:27 - people know you can also very easily do
01:28 - it in new input system here's another
01:30 - interesting question so can you modify
01:32 - the transform. for directly in order to
01:34 - rotate a transform so yes or no in my
01:37 - case I do know the answer is yes because
01:39 - this is my preferred method for rotating
01:40 - a transform so let's vote and yep I am
01:42 - indeed correct you can modify transform
01:44 - forward in order to rotate a transform
01:46 - the simplest way is really just calulate
01:47 - a direction to your Target and then set
01:49 - it to that direction that will make the
01:50 - transform Point directly towards your
01:52 - target alternatively you can also modify
01:54 - the transform. up to match a collision
01:56 - normal this is exactly what I use in the
01:58 - video on how I made the Scout probe
02:00 - launcher from other Wells basically how
02:02 - that Scout probe is thrown and then it
02:04 - attaches to a place and gets pointed to
02:06 - the opposite of where it lands or
02:08 - alternatively one working in 2D it can
02:10 - be super useful for some kind of top
02:11 - down shooter here's another fun one so
02:13 - what is the difference between action
02:14 - float and Funk float so are they both
02:16 - the same does Action take a float
02:18 - parameter and Funk return a float or
02:21 - does Funk float take a float parameter
02:22 - and action float return float so which
02:24 - one is it I'm going to take a random
02:26 - guess and let's say that it's a third
02:28 - one and no this is actually incorrect
02:29 - cor so the correct answer was B so
02:31 - action float takes a float parameter and
02:33 - fun float returns a float both these are
02:35 - types of delegates actions are delegates
02:38 - that return void and can have multiple
02:40 - parameters or none of them whereas funks
02:42 - they are delegates that return a
02:43 - specific type delegates are super
02:45 - awesome I definitely encourage you to
02:46 - learn about them I covered them in
02:48 - detail here and I've used them in tons
02:49 - of places like for example in the video
02:51 - where I talked about how to make an HTTP
02:53 - request from directly inside unity in
02:55 - doing this class I made a really nice
02:56 - callback so it actually gets the output
02:58 - back into a deleg
03:00 - or alternatively for interacting with
03:02 - all kinds of cloud providers usually
03:03 - that is done through an HTTP request so
03:06 - again you would use a delegate in order
03:07 - to not have the game freeze up whilst
03:09 - waiting for a response and a secondary
03:11 - thing related to this question is the
03:13 - type inside the angle brackets this is a
03:15 - generic which I also have a video on and
03:17 - it's also another Super useful thing so
03:19 - as you can see these are fun interesting
03:20 - questions related to C Unity or game
03:23 - development in general if you'd like to
03:24 - set up a habit of getting these I made
03:26 - an automated email notification you can
03:28 - go to the website and then log in then
03:30 - go into your user page then here you can
03:32 - manage your email notifications and
03:34 - there's a new one so you can receive
03:36 - every question of the day like I said
03:37 - these are all automatically generate so
03:39 - every 3 days there's a brand new
03:40 - question or alternatively you can just
03:42 - see it on the website I made it over
03:43 - here right underneath the last three
03:45 - videos I think this is an interesting
03:47 - way to increase your knowledge by
03:48 - answering some interesting questions
03:49 - every few days one thing that I always
03:51 - say is that it's much better to learn
03:53 - something regularly as opposed to making
03:55 - a huge Sprint and then not touching
03:56 - anything for an entire week so making a
03:58 - habit of answering a question every 3
04:00 - days that should hopefully help you
04:01 - learn better and as you saw regardless
04:03 - if you get the answer right or wrong I
04:05 - made sure to include lots of extra
04:06 - details in the actual answer alongside
04:08 - links to any helpful videos that I've
04:09 - already done so whether you get it wrong
04:11 - or you already know the answer either
04:13 - way you might still learn something new
04:15 - this is something that I've wanted to
04:16 - make for a long time and I finally made
04:17 - it so I really hope you enjoy it thanks
04:19 - for watching and I'll see you next time
