00:00 - personally I'm always a fan of gorilla
00:01 - style gameplay where you control
00:02 - basically a small team and you have to
00:04 - sneakily take out a very large enemy
00:05 - Force the game basically has a mechanic
00:07 - where you start off hidden and as long
00:09 - as you are hidden you can take out tons
00:10 - of enemies silently although there is
00:12 - also a really nice noise radius I like
00:14 - how the game gives you perfect
00:15 - information so before you attack you can
00:17 - see okay is this going to make me
00:18 - discovered or not as a game designer you
00:20 - always have both options do you want to
00:21 - give the player perfect information or
00:23 - do you want her to be some Randomness
00:24 - involved in both options are personally
00:26 - valid it just depends on what kind of
00:27 - game you're trying to make
