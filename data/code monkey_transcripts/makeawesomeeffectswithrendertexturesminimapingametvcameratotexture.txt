00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's learn how to use render
00:04 - textures
00:05 - this is a unity feature that is
00:06 - extremely useful for making all kinds of
00:08 - interesting effects
00:09 - like an in-game tv or a mini-map or much
00:12 - much more
00:12 - also this video is a lecture taken from
00:15 - my ultimate unity overview course
00:17 - unity is massive so in the course i
00:18 - explain over 30 features and tools of
00:20 - the engine that you might not know about
00:22 - there's individual lectures explaining
00:24 - tons of things like shadowgraph assembly
00:26 - definitions
00:27 - pro builder the video player and so on
00:29 - also the course will continuously be
00:31 - updated with free updates as i add more
00:33 - and more
00:34 - lectures explaining more and more tools
00:35 - and features so go ahead and get the
00:37 - full course and
00:38 - learn how to master all the unity tools
00:40 - to help you make better games faster
00:42 - in this lecture we're going to learn all
00:44 - about render textures in yinty
00:46 - this is a really awesome feature that
00:48 - has limitless potential for making some
00:50 - really cool effects
00:51 - essentially they are textures that you
00:53 - can render onto so instead of having the
00:55 - camera render directly onto the screen
00:57 - you can make it render onto a texture
00:59 - and then you can use that texture to
01:01 - make all kinds of effects
01:03 - like an in-game tv or a mini-map or some
01:05 - custom post-processing
01:07 - so let's see how it works first thing we
01:09 - need to do is actually create the render
01:11 - texture so
01:12 - for that just right click go into create
01:14 - and up here we've got the render texture
01:16 - so you get the object and over here in
01:18 - the inspector we can see all of these
01:19 - settings
01:20 - now the most important one is up here
01:22 - going to be the size
01:24 - so this is the resolution of the
01:26 - rendered texture
01:27 - naturally with a higher resolution you
01:29 - won't get better quality but at the same
01:31 - time obviously it has a cost for
01:32 - performance
01:34 - so the resolution needs to be tailored
01:35 - towards what you're going to use the
01:37 - texture for
01:38 - the size of the resolution itself is
01:40 - very important as is the aspect ratio
01:42 - so with 256 by 256 i've got a square
01:45 - image
01:46 - then you can apply anti-aliasing or not
01:48 - again this is going to have a certain
01:49 - performance cost
01:51 - you can set the depth buffer to be
01:53 - included or not so no that buffer
01:55 - no stencil or width stencil and the rest
01:57 - are pretty similar to the normal texture
01:59 - options
01:59 - so enable mid map play around the color
02:02 - format
02:03 - mess around with the wrap mode filter
02:04 - mode and so on okay so this is the
02:07 - render texture
02:08 - now let's see how we can use it over
02:09 - here for my very simple demo i simply
02:11 - got a player character that i can move
02:13 - around
02:14 - and now let's say i want to create the
02:16 - tv to see myself moving
02:17 - so for that let's create a new camera so
02:20 - a new camera
02:22 - let's name this the tv camera and now
02:24 - just like this
02:25 - both cameras are rendering onto the same
02:27 - screen however if we go into the camera
02:29 - and down here we go into the output
02:31 - section here we have an output texture
02:34 - field and as you can see it receives a
02:36 - type render texture so if we drag our
02:38 - render texture onto it
02:40 - and if just like that the main camera is
02:42 - back to normal and now the render
02:43 - texture
02:44 - yep there you go now it is rendering
02:46 - what that camera is seeing
02:48 - so this second camera is running onto
02:49 - the texture instead of the screen
02:51 - so now let me just place it on a random
02:53 - position so let's say about here
02:55 - and here's a quick unity shortcut you
02:57 - move around the scene view
02:59 - then select the object and then hit ctrl
03:01 - shift f and it places that object
03:03 - directly in there
03:04 - alright so there i've got my tv camera
03:06 - and all we need to do is just make a
03:08 - simple quad to display our texture
03:10 - so let me create a 3d object let's say a
03:13 - quad
03:15 - and let's position it in there
03:22 - then just make a material for it
03:26 - and simply render this render texture so
03:29 - we're using the render texture as if
03:31 - it's a normal texture and now if i hit
03:33 - play
03:33 - and yep there it is we have our tv fully
03:36 - working so as i'm moving around
03:37 - yep i can see my character move around
03:39 - on that tv
03:41 - alright awesome so these are the basics
03:44 - for render textures you render a camera
03:46 - onto a texture instead of directly onto
03:48 - the screen
03:48 - now one feature that is perfect for this
03:50 - is making a mini map
03:52 - so for that instead of placing the tv
03:54 - camera on the side let's place it
03:55 - directly above
03:57 - so let's put the y position bottom 20
04:00 - everything else on zero
04:01 - and let's just angle it downwards so
04:04 - down by 90 degrees
04:06 - and now for a mini map you don't want to
04:08 - render it directly on the scene view but
04:10 - instead of
04:10 - on the ui so let's create the ui let's
04:14 - first of make a canvas then inside
04:17 - make a ui and now here you see two
04:20 - objects
04:21 - so normally you would use a normal image
04:23 - so if i go and see it
04:25 - yep this is a normal image so you can
04:26 - choose a sprite and it shows up
04:28 - however if i try to drag the random
04:30 - texture nope does not work
04:32 - that is because this one expects a
04:34 - sprite and not a texture
04:36 - so in order to show a texture or a
04:37 - render texture on the ui
04:39 - you remove this component and instead of
04:41 - adding an image
04:43 - you add a raw image and now this one
04:46 - does take a normal texture
04:48 - as its input so if we drag this one on
04:51 - there
04:52 - if there you go now it does correctly
04:53 - display our render texture so this is
04:55 - our ui
04:56 - let's just put it down in the corner
05:04 - and let's just add an outline just to
05:06 - make it look a bit nice
05:11 - okay so let's play and see and all right
05:13 - here i am and as i move
05:14 - yep i can indeed see myself moving from
05:16 - the camera that is seeing from above
05:18 - now a mini mac camera is usually
05:20 - supposed to be a 2d camera so in there
05:22 - that one has some perspective
05:24 - so it's not supposed to do that so
05:26 - that's an easy fix
05:27 - instead of making a perspective camera
05:29 - just make an orthographic
05:31 - then play around the size and yep now
05:34 - that is correct we've got a flat camera
05:36 - so like this minimap is working but mini
05:39 - maps are usually a simplified
05:40 - representation of the world
05:42 - and not exactly the same thing but
05:44 - smaller so let's see how we can achieve
05:46 - that
05:47 - now doing that is very simple we just
05:49 - need to play around with the normal
05:50 - camera features
05:52 - so for example up here we've got the
05:54 - culling mask
05:55 - so this is which layers this camera will
05:57 - render
05:58 - so let's make a new layer just for our
06:00 - minimap objects
06:01 - so let's go up here to layers let's add
06:03 - a new layer let's name this the mini map
06:06 - and now we go into our tv camera let's
06:08 - actually rename this to the minimap
06:10 - camera
06:11 - and here on the calling mask instead of
06:13 - everything first let's select nothing
06:14 - and then only the minimap
06:16 - so now as you can see it's now rendering
06:18 - anything and now we go into the player
06:20 - game object
06:22 - and in here let's add a component let's
06:24 - add a 2d sprite
06:25 - just a normal square sprite this is
06:27 - going to be the minimap icon
06:30 - and then we just need to put this on the
06:32 - layer put it on the minimap layer
06:34 - then let's play around the size and
06:36 - maybe the color
06:40 - and then just need to make sure that
06:42 - it's pointing upwards so
06:44 - let's just flip it over here on the x
06:47 - and yep like this we do see the player
06:49 - on minimap but we're also seeing it on
06:51 - the main camera
06:52 - so again very simple we just go into the
06:54 - main camera and on the calling mask we
06:56 - render everything
06:57 - except the minimap layer and yep that is
07:00 - correct
07:01 - now we can just play around with the
07:02 - minimap in case we want
07:04 - so for example let's make a round
07:06 - minimap instead
07:39 - and yep there it is so i did we just
07:42 - make an image for the border visual
07:44 - and then another one for the mask so for
07:46 - the image just a circle
07:48 - and then just made a mask and then
07:49 - inside it i've got the raw image with
07:51 - the render texture
07:53 - so with all that yep here we have our
07:55 - awesome mini-map fully working
07:56 - it was very easy to do and all of it
07:58 - thanks to render textures
08:00 - now as you saw on the render textures
08:02 - over here you can also include the
08:03 - in-depth buffer and the stencil buffer
08:05 - so with all that data you can get as
08:07 - creative as you want with your render
08:09 - textures and making some custom shaders
08:11 - okay now let's just briefly see some
08:13 - code so first you can create the render
08:15 - detection like we saw create a normal
08:17 - asset in the project files
08:18 - or you can create it directly in code by
08:21 - using the constructor
08:23 - so new render texture
08:27 - and then here you can copy the settings
08:29 - from another render texture
08:30 - or just create it by default so give it
08:33 - a size depth and so on
08:38 - so that's how you create it then for
08:41 - dynamically assigning it to a camera
08:43 - you go for example let's grab the main
08:45 - camera and you modify the target
08:47 - texture so this is the target random
08:50 - texture that we saw previously in the
08:52 - editor
08:52 - so in here you would set it then in
08:55 - order to
08:56 - remove it and have the camera render
08:57 - back onto the screen you would set it to
08:59 - no
09:00 - so for example if you want to capture
09:01 - the main camera to do something
09:03 - you would set the turret texture then
09:05 - you would tell the camera to render
09:09 - and then you would set the render
09:10 - texture back into note so that would
09:12 - essentially take a screenshot and it
09:14 - would stay over here on the render
09:15 - texture
09:17 - all right so that's render textures in
09:18 - ent it's an awesome feature that has
09:21 - limited potential
09:22 - for making all kinds of effects to make
09:23 - your games really stand out
09:25 - alright so this was a lecture from my
09:27 - ultimate unity overview course
09:29 - there's lots more explaining tons of
09:30 - things like shadowgraph assembly
09:32 - definitions pro builder the video player
09:34 - and so on
09:35 - go ahead and get the full course and
09:37 - learn how to master all the unity tools
09:39 - and features at your disposal in order
09:40 - to help you make
09:41 - better games faster alright hope that's
09:44 - useful check out these videos to learn
