00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here is the fill your toolbox
00:03 - megabundle now active on the unity asset
00:06 - store as usual it's a massive discount
00:07 - at 95 off on over a thousand dollars
00:10 - worth of assets this one is full of
00:12 - really interesting tools there's one to
00:14 - help you manage an inventory database
00:16 - another one for some decals and terrain
00:17 - system there's a digging system slice
00:20 - meshes volumetric vfx and tons more with
00:22 - such a deep discount it's worth if just
00:24 - one of these assets looks interesting
00:26 - these are also assets that haven't been
00:28 - bundled before i only had one of them so
00:30 - i picked up the bundle right away on the
00:32 - first year one of the asks is enhanced
00:34 - scrawlr if you have lots of scrollball
00:36 - objects in your ui this can help make it
00:38 - look quite a bit better and much more
00:40 - performant it dynamically creates and
00:42 - destroys objects so you can have lists
00:44 - with thousands or millions of entries
00:46 - and it all works great the asset comes
00:48 - with tons of demos showing all kinds of
00:50 - possible use cases with lots of
00:51 - different cell types both vertical and
00:53 - horizontal bars it features auto
00:55 - scrolling pull down refresh nested
00:57 - scrollers and tons more so if you're
00:59 - having ui performance issues in your
01:01 - game or you really just have lots of
01:03 - scrolling then definitely give this one
01:04 - a try on the second tier one of the
01:06 - interesting ones is easy decal
01:08 - just in case you don't know what are
01:09 - decals this is how you can essentially
01:11 - draw a sprite on top of a mesh so things
01:14 - like bullet holes graffiti and so on it
01:17 - uses multiple techniques it can be baked
01:19 - on awake or be dynamic it can fit
01:21 - whatever mesh you want and ignore
01:23 - certain objects you can use just a
01:25 - single material or apply decals from the
01:27 - entire atlas this kind of thing that is
01:29 - super useful for giving your levels that
01:31 - extra bit of polish
01:32 - then you have the mesh slicer now a
01:34 - while ago i made a video on how you can
01:36 - use pro builder to slice meshes
01:38 - for me that wouldn't always work great
01:40 - but some people in the comments did say
01:42 - that meth didn't work for them that too
01:44 - is an experimental so maybe there are
01:46 - some cases where it doesn't work so here
01:48 - you've got this tool which is dedicated
01:49 - to just slicing things so it should work
01:51 - in every scenario also one of the main
01:53 - comments on that video was asking if you
01:55 - could slice in run time using that
01:57 - method is a bit tricky but with this
01:59 - asset makes it super easy
02:01 - it comes with a whole bunch of demos for
02:03 - example there's one with a moving skin
02:05 - mesh render so it's a animated character
02:07 - and it perfectly slices exactly where it
02:09 - should all these slices have physics and
02:11 - they all fall apart it can slice
02:13 - anywhere any part and a couple more
02:15 - demos showing slicing objects with
02:17 - multiple methods there's plenty of
02:19 - slicing methods to make it work
02:20 - perfectly during runtime the code runs
02:23 - asynchronously so it doesn't lock your
02:25 - game while calculating the slices looks
02:27 - really good and seems to work in every
02:29 - scenario next up you've got dungeon
02:31 - architect this one is a really massive
02:33 - tool tons and tons of features it has
02:35 - been development since 2016 with tons of
02:38 - updates over the years it allows you to
02:40 - manually create levels or generate them
02:42 - automatically you can swap around all
02:44 - the props and get different themes it
02:46 - also generates a basic navigation mesh
02:48 - for pathfinding so tons and tons of
02:50 - features it comes with a very well
02:52 - organized custom editor and lots of
02:54 - samples it's a pretty massive tool so
02:56 - there is definitely a learning curve
02:58 - involved but if you take the time to
03:00 - learn it you will have a massively
03:01 - powerful tool at your disposal then
03:03 - another interesting asset is digger pro
03:05 - as you know the unity terrain system is
03:07 - pretty awesome for making terrains but
03:09 - not so much for making holes so if you
03:11 - want to dig down and make some caves
03:13 - then this one seems great it works on
03:15 - top of the regular terrain object so if
03:18 - you already have some terrains in your
03:19 - game you don't have to rebuild them all
03:21 - from scratch this works on top of it you
03:23 - just go into the menu and automatically
03:25 - sets up your terrain to support digging
03:27 - holes you can use whatever brace you
03:29 - want whatever size and texture you want
03:32 - it really is very easy to do and does
03:33 - the exactly what you want alright so
03:35 - those are just some of the helmets and
03:37 - there's many more in the bundle for
03:39 - example you've got the space graphics
03:40 - toolkit
03:41 - lots of space ui things for making any
03:44 - kind of sci-fi game then you've got one
03:46 - with some realistic eye movements so if
03:47 - you've got a character heavy game this
03:49 - can be great if you've got s100 pro for
03:51 - locating assets in your game then you've
03:53 - got performance tools this one is great
03:55 - for optimizing your game by placing
03:57 - complex meshes with simple impulsers
03:59 - another one also focus on slicing but
04:01 - this one is more making fractures so
04:03 - instead of making just one big slice you
04:05 - really just break the whole thing apart
04:06 - so great for glass or any kind of
04:08 - shatter effect and as you can see lots
04:10 - of more interesting ones it ends in the
04:12 - end of this month so check it out with a
04:14 - link in the description and as usual
04:15 - that's an affiliate link so if you get
04:17 - it you get some awesome assets and you
04:18 - also help support the channel alright
04:20 - hope that's useful check out these
04:22 - videos to learn some more thanks to
04:24 - these awesome patreon supporters for
04:26 - making these videos possible thank you
04:28 - for watching and i'll see you next time
