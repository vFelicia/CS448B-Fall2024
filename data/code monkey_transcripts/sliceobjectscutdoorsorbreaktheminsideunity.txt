00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video let's learn how to do
00:03 - something very useful we're going to do
00:05 - some boolean logic using meshes with pro
00:07 - builder this is super useful for when
00:09 - you want to cut an object to make
00:11 - something like a door or a window or
00:13 - when you want to merge two objects
00:14 - together or just get the intersection
00:16 - mesh it's very easy to do but it's
00:18 - surprisingly hidden so let's learn how
00:20 - to use it if you prefer a more guided
00:22 - path with step-by-step lectures then
00:24 - check out my complete courses learn how
00:26 - to make a builder defender game using
00:28 - c-sharp just like i make my own steam
00:30 - games or learn how to make games
00:32 - internally using visual scripting or
00:34 - learn all about unity with the ultimate
00:36 - overview course which contains over 13
00:38 - lectures each covering a different tool
00:40 - or feature of the engine to help you
00:41 - make better games faster i'm always
00:43 - available in the courses q a section
00:45 - answering your questions every single
00:47 - day so check out all the courses with
00:48 - the link in the description okay so
00:50 - let's learn how to do some interesting
00:51 - things using pro bimmer i had to learn
00:53 - how to do this for an upcoming video and
00:55 - it actually took quite a while to find
00:57 - out how to do it since the option is
00:58 - hidden deep so i'm guessing most of you
01:00 - don't know about this super useful
01:02 - feature hopefully this video will show
01:03 - up when people search for this so the
01:05 - feature in question is doing some
01:07 - boolean logic with two meshes so it's
01:09 - great for cutting holes merging meshes
01:11 - or getting the intersection over here in
01:13 - this project i have this simple wall
01:15 - object and now the thing that i need to
01:17 - do for an upcoming video was figure out
01:19 - how to cut this object into various
01:21 - pieces so first you go into the package
01:23 - manager and you'll look for the
01:25 - programmer package here i've got version
01:27 - 4.5.2 although i believe this feature
01:30 - exists in pretty much every version so
01:32 - when it's installed you can go over here
01:33 - into tools pro builder and open up the
01:35 - pro bundler window now with that the
01:37 - first thing that you need to do is take
01:38 - this mesh which as you can see this is a
01:40 - perfectly normal mesh and the first
01:42 - thing that we need is just to convert
01:44 - into a programmer mesh so just select
01:46 - the object make sure you're on object
01:47 - selection
01:49 - and then up here there's the really nice
01:50 - pro builderize menu so just click on it
01:53 - and it automatically convert this into a
01:55 - pro bundler mesh okay now i need
01:57 - something to make the cut so let me just
01:59 - go up here make a new 3d cube and now
02:01 - let's say i want to cut a little corner
02:03 - of this
02:04 - okay i want to cut that part on the mesh
02:07 - so now let's see that feature now the
02:09 - reason why it doesn't show by default is
02:10 - because it's tagged as experimental i'm
02:13 - not sure why it's marked as experimental
02:15 - since it's been out for a long time and
02:17 - from what i've used it it always worked
02:18 - exactly as intended
02:20 - but in order to enable it you go up here
02:22 - into edit and go down into preferences
02:24 - then you scroll down and find the pro
02:26 - bundle tab and then over here you see a
02:28 - toggle for experimental features so you
02:31 - just go ahead and click on it
02:33 - and when you do then don't touch
02:34 - anything else it seems like it didn't do
02:36 - anything but it's actually recompiling
02:37 - the programmer scripts so after a bit
02:40 - you should see the box ticked yep there
02:42 - it is so experimental features are now
02:44 - enabled
02:45 - so with that you can now go into tools
02:47 - pro bundler go into experimental and
02:49 - open up the boolean tool all right so
02:51 - this one takes two pro bundler meshes
02:54 - so let's select ours so first of all on
02:56 - the wall so just click and drag the wall
02:58 - and now for the cube i didn't actually
03:00 - probiotize it yet so i can't really drag
03:02 - it so just select the cube and up here
03:05 - and just program the rise it and then
03:07 - now i can drag the reference okay so
03:09 - i've got the wall in the cube and now
03:10 - with both meshes selected then over here
03:12 - we can select the operation so the first
03:15 - one is intersection so let's begin with
03:17 - this one so just hit on apply and now
03:19 - this one creates an actual brand new
03:21 - object so it doesn't modify it doesn't
03:23 - touch the original object so just move
03:25 - it on to the side to see it and as you
03:27 - can see this one is the interaction the
03:29 - intersection between that one and down
03:30 - so just get that nice little corn there
03:33 - so for example in my case for that video
03:35 - that i'm working on where i wanted to
03:36 - create parts of this wall this was the
03:38 - most useful one i just make the cube
03:40 - with the shape that i want rotation that
03:42 - i want then i cut it and cut the wall
03:44 - into various parts okay so here we've
03:46 - got our cut now let's look at the other
03:47 - operations by the way if you find the
03:49 - video helpful please hit the like button
03:51 - it's a tiny thing but it really does
03:52 - help thanks so the next one is union
03:56 - so this one merges both objects so again
03:59 - if i hit on apply creates a new one and
04:01 - there you go so now the wall has this
04:03 - cube attached to it all of it in just
04:05 - one object
04:06 - so perhaps this one could be useful for
04:08 - simplifying your scene in order to have
04:10 - fewer game objects and then the last one
04:12 - which is possibly the most useful the
04:14 - subtraction operation so this one cuts a
04:17 - mesh so for example let's put the cube
04:20 - a bit more down there so something like
04:22 - this
04:23 - okay and now hit on apply and here's my
04:25 - new object and yep look like that it
04:27 - looks almost perfectly like a wall with
04:29 - a hole for a door so you can definitely
04:31 - see how this is very useful or perhaps
04:34 - shifted a bit upwards
04:35 - and there you go now instead of a door
04:37 - now we've got a nice hole for a window
04:39 - so those are all the various modes also
04:42 - over here i'm demonstrating on this nice
04:43 - simple wall but this works on really
04:45 - anything so for example over here is a
04:48 - simple target object looks really nice
04:50 - so it's a target on the stand but now
04:52 - let's say you want just the target
04:53 - without the stand so again just probably
04:55 - rise to target then just grab the cube
04:58 - put it in there and make an intersection
05:01 - make an intersection and hit on apply
05:03 - and yep over here i've got my target
05:05 - mesh so it's just the top part without
05:07 - the bottom also just one quick note here
05:10 - there is a slightly weird issue which is
05:12 - sometimes you can see that the mesh
05:14 - simply disappears that is the only issue
05:16 - that i found out to this and that one
05:18 - has to do with the simple origin of the
05:20 - pivot so when it cuts apparently the
05:22 - pivot for the whole mesh goes all the
05:24 - way far away so you can easily solve
05:26 - that by going just over here into the
05:28 - vertex selection mode and just select
05:30 - the simple vertex set as pivot and there
05:33 - you go now that one is working perfectly
05:35 - so just one quick note and everything
05:37 - else works perfectly okay so as you can
05:39 - see this feature is super useful and
05:41 - super easy to use although it's hidden
05:42 - by default but now you know how it's
05:44 - done stay tuned for the upcoming video
05:46 - which has to do with blowing up some
05:48 - nice walls again if you're looking for a
05:50 - more guided path with step-by-step
05:52 - lectures then check out my complete
05:53 - courses alright hope that's useful check
