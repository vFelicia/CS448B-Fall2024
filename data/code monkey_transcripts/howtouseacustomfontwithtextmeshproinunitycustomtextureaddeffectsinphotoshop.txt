00:00 - in this video we're going to learn how
00:01 - to use custom fonts with text mesh
00:03 - browser netting this one I always to add
00:06 - effects to our phones like gradients and
00:08 - weird outlines and use them the same as
00:10 - normal text let's begin
00:15 - [Music]
00:19 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:21 - and this channel is all about helping
00:23 - you learn how to make your own games
00:24 - with nf2 torrents made by a professional
00:26 - indie game developer so if you find the
00:28 - video helpful consider subscribing so
00:30 - this is our goal we have a bunch of
00:32 - Knights walking around with the name
00:34 - above their heads and as you can see the
00:36 - name is written in a very nice font with
00:38 - a bunch of nice effects and this really
00:40 - is a font as you can see since all these
00:42 - Knights have different names so we are
00:44 - using it exactly the same as any text so
00:47 - the goal is to be able to write text
00:48 - using a custom font with custom effects
00:51 - that we can modify on our texture
00:52 - alright so let's get to it so here is
00:56 - our testing scene there are a bunch of
00:58 - characters just walking around each of
00:59 - them has a unique name and this font
01:02 - obviously does not match what they look
01:04 - like so that's what we want to sort now
01:07 - the first thing that we need is a font
01:09 - there are many websites that have lots
01:11 - of free fonts so just go on to find
01:12 - something over here I have a pre nice
01:15 - unique font it's called archaeological
01:17 - sand it's a nice medieval font so it
01:20 - suits our sprites now if you're using
01:22 - the own text mesh component you can
01:24 - simply create a new text mesh and here
01:31 - you could just drag the font straight
01:33 - into there and everything would work so
01:36 - just like that our font is displayed
01:38 - using the text machine phone however
01:40 - with the new types mesh pro if we go in
01:43 - here create a new 3d object text mesh
01:45 - Pro here as you can see we cannot drag
01:48 - the font directly into there so the text
01:51 - mesh pro requires a bit more work but it
01:53 - also gives us a lot more options now the
01:56 - first thing that we need is to make sure
01:57 - that text mesh browser so when you
01:59 - create a new text match proved here this
02:03 - window allows you to import the
02:05 - essentials so just click on that and
02:08 - with that you can now use the text mesh
02:10 - Pro so you can walk into the inspector
02:12 - in order to see the various options that
02:14 - you have available so just at a glance
02:16 - you can see that we have a lot more
02:18 - options compared to the basic text mesh
02:20 - and the text also looks a lot better
02:23 - okay so for the custom font as you can
02:26 - see this requires a font asset so we
02:28 - cannot drag a font which means we need
02:31 - to first convert
02:32 - is font into a font asset so for that we
02:34 - go here into the window tex mex Pro and
02:37 - the font asset creator so this window
02:39 - appears and as you can see up here we do
02:41 - have a field for a font so we can now
02:44 - drag it and now let's just hit generate
02:46 - with the default parameters any up here
02:49 - it is you can see the actual texture
02:50 - that was generated so now let's hit save
02:52 - so here on the project files we now have
02:55 - our font asset so we can now go into the
02:58 - text match Pro and we can now drag our
03:00 - font asset and there it is there's our
03:02 - nice font so the characters are in
03:05 - Senshi ated through this prefab so let's
03:07 - simply open this go into the text much
03:09 - pro and drag our font asset and now
03:11 - let's test and yep our characters are
03:14 - now using our custom font which looks
03:16 - much better compared to these sprites
03:18 - okay so this is the way to just add a
03:20 - new simple font to your game
03:22 - however the cool thing about it is that
03:24 - we have an Atlas texture so if we have a
03:28 - texture that means we can modify it in
03:30 - any imaging program so before we start
03:32 - modifying our texture let's go into
03:34 - these options to see what they do so up
03:37 - here we have the source font file then
03:39 - we have the sampling point size it will
03:42 - automatically calculate the maximum size
03:44 - it can use to fit all the characters
03:46 - inside the texture then the padding
03:48 - which is the most important when the
03:49 - only weight custom fonts that you want
03:51 - to add effects essentially if you add
03:53 - something outside the font like for
03:54 - example an outline you need enough
03:56 - padding to be able to draw it so in this
03:59 - case since we're going to add a nice
04:00 - outline let's increase it to 10 then the
04:03 - packing method which is how close the
04:04 - clefts are packed together so fast for
04:07 - the most part is fine then we have the
04:09 - epaulettes resolution this is going to
04:12 - be the final size of our texture so this
04:14 - small item limit your character set or
04:16 - the character size in order to fit
04:17 - everything in the texture so for simple
04:20 - usage is 512 by 512 is probably fine
04:23 - but if you had a lot of extra padding or
04:25 - a lot of extra characters then you can
04:27 - simply increase this and go all the way
04:28 - up to as far as you need then we have
04:31 - the character set so this won't depend
04:34 - on what you want to do for example if
04:36 - you were making some sort of special
04:38 - font for a head counter then you would
04:40 - really only need numbers but in this
04:41 - case we want names
04:42 - so ASCII
04:44 - probably fun alternatively you can also
04:46 - select custom characters and in here put
04:49 - all the characters that you're going to
04:50 - need however do remember that the
04:52 - font-family itself needs to have that
04:54 - character if it doesn't then you won't
04:55 - actually see it then we have the font
04:58 - style then for the render mode these
05:01 - have to do with how the fonts are
05:02 - rendered now the first ones are bitmap
05:05 - fonts which means your font will only
05:06 - look good at that exact size so for in
05:09 - most cases you want to stick with
05:11 - distance field of either 16 or 32 the
05:14 - difference in these two is one of
05:15 - precision so it will depend on what you
05:17 - want to use it for but for most cases 16
05:19 - will do just fine and finally we have
05:21 - the kerning pairs so checking this just
05:24 - gets the kerning pairs from the font
05:25 - file so with all the options covered
05:28 - here is our font texture and we hit save
05:31 - and inside the font asset you can see
05:33 - the texture Athens however for the goal
05:36 - were trying to achieve here of modifying
05:38 - our texture using this render mode will
05:40 - not be very helpful so instead we go in
05:43 - here instead of creating a distance
05:45 - field 16 let's create a smooth and now
05:49 - we have this texture which is much more
05:51 - clear and much more perfect for our
05:53 - current goal so you have to keep in mind
05:55 - what your texture is going to be used
05:57 - for if you don't want to add a lot of
05:59 - special effects directly into the
06:01 - texture then using this texture would be
06:03 - better but since we're trying to add
06:05 - some special effects this one won't be
06:06 - better so we hit save and now we need
06:09 - some way of getting this texture so we
06:11 - can edit it so for that we some like the
06:13 - font asset and go up here to the gear
06:15 - icon and simply extract Atlas and upon
06:18 - clicking and there you go here's our new
06:21 - apples which is a simple PNG so now we
06:24 - can open this in any sort of image
06:25 - program so in my case I have it open
06:29 - here in Photoshop and now this is a
06:31 - texture unlike any other so we can
06:32 - modify this in any way donar requirement
06:36 - is that we stay within the padding area
06:38 - so we don't spill our effects onto other
06:40 - characters so let's add some effects
06:59 - so here's our modified found with a
07:01 - bunch of nice effects now that we have
07:04 - our texture let's save it as our PNG so
07:06 - you're in the project files you can see
07:08 - the original texture and our modified
07:10 - texture now we need to apply this to our
07:12 - font so for that we select the material
07:15 - inside our font asset and in here first
07:18 - of all since this is supposed to be a
07:19 - bitmap font we go in here text mesh and
07:22 - some like bitmap custom atlas and here
07:25 - on the debug settings we have a field
07:27 - for the font APIs and we simply drag our
07:29 - modified font apples and there it is
07:31 - there's our font with nice drop shadow a
07:33 - stroke and some nice colors okay so
07:35 - that's pretty much it now we can go here
07:38 - we can edit our text with anything we
07:39 - want
07:40 - be essentially this working just like
07:42 - normal text so this is normal text we
07:44 - can write anything as long as you have
07:46 - the characters in order to displayed
07:47 - okay so now on the character pre found
07:50 - in here I already have the text mesh Pro
07:53 - using this font and this material so
07:56 - everything should be working let's run
07:57 - the game and if there's our characters
08:00 - and each of them has a name with our
08:02 - custom font custom effects and custom
08:04 - anything so you now know how to create a
08:06 - font asset for any given font extract
08:09 - the apple√≠s from that font acent and
08:11 - modify the texture in any way you want
08:13 - in any image program finally you know
08:15 - how to import it back into the game in
08:17 - order to be used as a normal phone as
08:19 - always you can download the project
08:21 - files in utilities from in Tacoma keep
08:23 - calm if you liked the video subscribe to
08:25 - channel for more unity to turrets post
08:27 - any questions you have in the comments
08:28 - and I'll do my best answer alright see
08:30 - you next time
08:33 - [Music]
