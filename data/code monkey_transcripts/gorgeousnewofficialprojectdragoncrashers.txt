00:18 - the tools that are available as part of
00:20 - unity
00:20 - there's quite a few that you might not
00:22 - even know about this one uses pretty
00:24 - much every 2d tool in the engine
00:26 - so it's got bone-based 2d animation

01:44 - nice but simple main menu
01:46 - it's got some great sound design with
01:48 - the logo and a whole bunch of particles
01:50 - so we just click and it starts to load
01:55 - alright so right away we see a nice
01:57 - intro with a really fun cinematic
02:23 - so there it is a really fun intro
02:27 - now the game itself is an idle auto
02:29 - battler so it's a great way to showcase
02:31 - all these animations and effects
02:35 - so the characters are constantly
02:36 - attacking and over here we see some
02:38 - circular bars constantly growing
02:40 - as soon as they grow they can use a
02:41 - special so this one right here there you
02:44 - go a really awesome special
02:48 - so all these effects look really awesome
02:51 - and i gotta say i really love the sound
02:52 - design here
02:58 - then yep all of them go down and there
03:00 - we go we've got a nice victory
03:01 - so we can go into the next battle
03:24 - all right so now it's a boss fight
03:26 - against a very angry dragon
03:50 - and yep down goes the boss dragon
03:52 - alright so that's a demo
03:54 - as you can see it's a vertical slice
03:56 - that demonstrates tons of awesome 2d
03:58 - tools in action
03:59 - so now let's inspect it and learn to see
04:01 - how all of this works
04:02 - like i said you can download the project
04:04 - files for yourself from the asset store
04:06 - it's completely free
04:07 - this one is meant to be used with unt
04:08 - 2020.2 or the 2020.3 lts version which
04:12 - is what i'm using in here
04:14 - okay so here we are in the editor and
04:16 - right away you see a helm folder and
04:18 - inside there we've got a real nice
04:19 - readme file
04:21 - so here it explains what the demo is
04:22 - about and also has a whole bunch of
04:24 - links to learn some more
04:26 - so you've got a bunch of resources where
04:27 - they say they won't be adding some
04:28 - tutorials based on this demo
04:30 - you've got the previous demo the unlock
04:31 - script which also showcases a ton of
04:34 - gorgeous studio lights
04:35 - then you've got a webinar which went
04:37 - through some of the features on that
04:38 - demo
04:39 - then to the character animation a bunch
04:40 - of tips and so on and of course you can
04:42 - chat with the team directly over on the
04:44 - unt forums
04:45 - alright so here is the first battle
04:46 - scene we can inspect all these objects
04:49 - you can see all these nice gizmos and
04:51 - icons
04:52 - for example this icon that you see
04:54 - everywhere this is a sprite shape
04:56 - this is a really awesome tool for making
04:58 - some custom shapes
04:59 - so for example the main ones you see
05:01 - here is over here this minecart
05:03 - and then over here on the side you want
05:04 - to see the bridge so in terms of texture
05:07 - we can go and look at it and as you can
05:09 - see it's just a
05:10 - normal horizontal texture so this is the
05:12 - bridge texture
05:13 - but when working with sprite shapes we
05:15 - can click in here in order to edit a
05:17 - spline and there you go we see all these
05:18 - points
05:19 - and i can add a new point move it up
05:20 - move it down and so on
05:22 - so it takes a basic texture and creates
05:24 - pretty much any shape you want with it
05:26 - so here is the very weird bridge and the
05:28 - same thing over here for the minecart
05:30 - this is a super useful tool for making
05:32 - some weird shapes based on some standard
05:34 - textures
05:34 - it's handled by this sprite shape
05:36 - controller script and if you click on
05:38 - each point you can even see tons of
05:40 - options by the way if you find the video
05:42 - helpful
05:42 - please hit the like button it's a tiny
05:44 - thing but really does help
05:45 - thanks so this is one use for sprite
05:47 - shapes
05:48 - but another use is over here these
05:50 - pillars that you see yep look at that
05:52 - this one is also a sprite shape
05:54 - so instead of making this weird shape as
05:56 - a separate texture you just use this
05:58 - and this one showcase how you can have a
06:00 - different film sprite and edge sprite
06:02 - so you can see how the edge is faded
06:03 - which makes it look slightly blurry and
06:06 - if we inspect over here the sprite shape
06:08 - profile
06:08 - we can see how it's set up with a
06:10 - certain film texture which is just a
06:12 - black texture
06:13 - and then a black soft edge which is our
06:15 - edge texture there you go like that
06:17 - and here you can also play around with
06:18 - angles to have different sprites for
06:20 - different shapes
06:22 - you can play around with the offset set
06:23 - the fill or not and so on
06:25 - so that's sprite shape a really awesome
06:27 - tool for easily making some super
06:29 - adaptable shapes
06:30 - another thing you notice right away in
06:32 - this demo are these tiny little green
06:34 - dots
06:34 - these are 2d bones and 2d ik in action
06:37 - so for example if i grab the skeleton
06:39 - sword and i move
06:40 - yep there you go the shoulder and arm
06:42 - moves correctly with it
06:44 - and if you click on the object
06:45 - themselves we can actually see the bones
06:48 - and for example if i grab his pelvis and
06:51 - i just move him around and there you go
06:53 - you can see all the ik in action
06:54 - so all those points those are the target
06:56 - points and it automatically calculates
06:58 - everything needed in order to make the
06:59 - bones hit that position
07:01 - so using 2d ik is super useful for
07:03 - animation
07:04 - then for how all of the body parts are
07:06 - set up this is using another 2d tool
07:08 - it's the psd importer
07:09 - so if we click on it we can see that
07:11 - this character skeleton is a psb file
07:14 - and if we open it here it is the
07:16 - character open up inside of photoshop
07:18 - now usually when making a spreadsheet
07:20 - what you would do would be separate all
07:21 - the body parts and then slice this
07:23 - texture
07:23 - but here as you can see it's set up like
07:25 - a normal character so all the body parts
07:28 - are exactly where they should be so this
07:30 - is the psd important in action it reads
07:33 - all of the separate layers
07:34 - and automatically separates them and use
07:36 - them as body parts
07:37 - so there's no need for you to make some
07:39 - weird spreadsheets with all the body
07:41 - parts separated
07:42 - you just draw your character like normal
07:44 - separate all the layers
07:45 - and then in unity when it imports we can
07:48 - go up here to open up the sprite editor
07:50 - and yep unity automatically splits them
07:52 - up into a proper sprite sheet
07:53 - so you can see how this is super useful
07:55 - for making characters without having to
07:57 - work with all the body parts separate
07:59 - then another 2d feature they're using
08:01 - is normal maps so on the sprite editor
08:04 - you can go here to see some secondary
08:06 - textures
08:06 - and then you can see it's got a normal
08:08 - map and a mass texture and if we click
08:10 - on it
08:11 - yep here is the normal map which then
08:13 - interacts with all of the 2d and lights
08:15 - then over here on the sprite editor
08:16 - another thing we can see is the skinning
08:18 - editor
08:19 - so this is where you can set up all the
08:21 - bones in their area of influence
08:23 - you can see how all of these impact
08:25 - different parts of the sprite
08:26 - so you can see just how many different
08:28 - tools they use in order to bring these
08:29 - characters to life
08:30 - then also the first thing that happened
08:32 - as soon as the battle loads
08:34 - is a nice cutscene so this one is
08:36 - handled by
08:37 - timeline so over here inside cutscenes
08:39 - we've got the timeline intro skeletons
08:42 - if you double click over here on the
08:44 - timeline this opens up the timeline
08:46 - window where you can see all of the
08:48 - events
08:48 - so timeline is another super useful tool
08:50 - that will help you greatly in making
08:52 - cinematics for your game so you've got
08:54 - this bar
08:54 - where you can input all kinds of actions
08:56 - so there you go look at everything
08:58 - happening the intro they go in they move
09:00 - and so on you've got tracks where you
09:02 - can input all the various things so here
09:04 - they're using a track for the ui another
09:06 - one for the camera for some animations
09:07 - audio objects and so on
09:09 - and something which works very well with
09:11 - the timeline is over here the cameras
09:12 - which are using virtual cameras so
09:14 - they're using cinemachine
09:15 - so first starts off with the entrance
09:17 - camera then it goes into the zoom in
09:20 - camera
09:20 - then goes the camera down to the right
09:22 - side then it zooms in and then to the
09:24 - left and then the battle
09:25 - and the ui as well which on the end the
09:27 - ui suddenly pops up
09:29 - and finally when the timeline actually
09:31 - ends so when the cutscene timeline is
09:32 - finished
09:33 - then it goes into this script and calls
09:34 - on this function to actually start the
09:36 - battle
09:37 - so if you've got cutscenes in your game
09:38 - then you should learn how timeline works
09:40 - it can definitely save you a ton of time
09:42 - and of course another thing that this
09:44 - game showcases is
09:45 - very good use of 2d lighting so as you
09:47 - may know there are all kinds of 2d
09:49 - lights you can use for example there's
09:50 - that gem there
09:52 - and it's got a freeform light on top
09:54 - look at that so the light has this shape
09:56 - so it's placed over there in order to
09:58 - really brighten up that gem
09:59 - then you've got a spotlight like this
10:01 - one over here on the entrance so you can
10:02 - play around with all these so these
10:03 - studio lights are really awesome
10:05 - and another interesting thing that they
10:07 - did was to make some lights only affect
10:09 - the background and some only the
10:10 - character
10:12 - so for example over here there's
10:13 - actually two lights placed one on top of
10:15 - the other one
10:16 - so this one as you can see targets for
10:17 - layers this one is only affecting the
10:19 - characters
10:19 - and if i move this you can also see over
10:21 - there the normal maps being impact on
10:22 - the characters
10:23 - so look at that as i move the light it
10:25 - moves where the light actually hits
10:27 - if i select on the lights and just
10:29 - disable them yep you see the difference
10:30 - that it makes
10:32 - then they also use line renderers in
10:34 - some interesting ways
10:35 - so over here you see this thing which
10:37 - seems like a bit of smoke going left and
10:39 - right
10:40 - so this one is just a basic line render
10:42 - so it's using that it's got a certain
10:44 - width the color and so on
10:45 - and then down here it is simply using a
10:47 - material using a custom shader made in
10:49 - shadowgraph so this one is just a basic
10:51 - shader that uses the time node in order
10:53 - to constantly move and change the offset
10:55 - over time
10:55 - then another shadow graph effect you see
10:57 - is over here this little waterfall
10:59 - so that's also handled by a shader and
11:02 - also this one up here which is like a
11:03 - spiderweb
11:04 - waving in the wind this one is also
11:06 - using shadowgraph
11:08 - which again if you want to know how all
11:09 - of these work you can edit and you can
11:11 - see exactly how all these shaders were
11:13 - created
11:14 - then one tool that i'm sure you're
11:16 - already familiar with is the 2d tile map
11:18 - so over here they also used it for the
11:20 - background so like that that's a
11:21 - background setup using tiles
11:23 - i've covered this one in a dedicated
11:25 - video previously if you want to learn
11:26 - more
11:27 - then another element of this demo is the
11:29 - ui interestingly they went with a screen
11:32 - space canvas but using a camera so it
11:34 - matches up perfectly with the scene
11:35 - the ui itself is also some pretty basic
11:37 - stuff so for example the health bars
11:39 - themselves they are just sliders so
11:41 - there you go
11:42 - and for the ring ability it is also just
11:45 - a basic image
11:46 - and over here it's set to filmed radio
11:48 - 360 so then you got the film amount and
11:50 - you just move it
11:51 - and then of course it just has a custom
11:52 - material which really just has an hdr
11:54 - light in order to give it a nice glow
11:56 - so on the ui itself nothing too special
11:58 - just looking great
11:59 - and the last thing that i want to
12:00 - inspect are the effects
12:03 - so here you see all these effects they
12:05 - all look really great
12:06 - and for example let's inspect this one
12:08 - so let's do that one and stop
12:10 - and here we see how they're using the
12:11 - standard particle system so in this case
12:13 - this demo is not using the vfx ref so
12:15 - these are normal standard particles
12:17 - you can see it's on like this got a
12:19 - mission shape color noise renderer and
12:21 - so on
12:22 - there's a whole bunch of really cool
12:24 - effects in this demo so definitely
12:25 - download it and look at them to see how
12:27 - they work
12:28 - and of course there's the dragon scene
12:29 - which features very much of the same
12:31 - thing so
12:31 - tons of sprite shapes studio lights
12:33 - trails effects
12:35 - and then for dragon itself which you set
12:36 - up just like the characters
12:38 - so it's got all kinds of bones it's set
12:40 - up using the psd importer and it's got
12:42 - all these handles with some really nice
12:43 - ik
12:44 - okay so there you have it these sample
12:46 - projects are an excellent way to see how
12:48 - unity themselves use their tools and
12:50 - everything that is possible to make
12:51 - go ahead download the project file and
12:53 - inspect it for yourself
12:54 - depending on what game you're making
12:56 - this can be a great case study to learn
12:58 - how to use these tools
12:59 - and don't forget to check out the asset
13:01 - source spring sale and get some awesome
