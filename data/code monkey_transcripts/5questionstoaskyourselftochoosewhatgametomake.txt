00:00 - Hello and Welcome, I am your Code Monkey and
in this video I'm going to give you 5 questions
00:03 - that you can ask yourself to decide what game
to make
00:06 - Lets begin
00:10 - Question Number One
Is it a game you want to make?
00:13 - Some people might think of choosing what game
to make based on whats popular and trying
00:16 - to chase that trend
If you do that you really need to ask yourself
00:20 - if this is truly a game you want to make
Ask yourself if you're a fan of the genre
00:24 - and if you're excited to play the final version
you see in your head
00:28 - Making a game is a marathon and requires many
hours to produce a compelling experience
00:32 - It will be very difficult to force yourself to work on a game you have no passion for
00:36 - just because you think it will be popular in the end
00:39 - Every game obviously has roadblocks and tough
times where you must force yourself through
00:43 - them but you cannot do that through the whole
journey
00:46 - So the first thing you need is to pick something
that you really want to make and play
00:51 - Question Number Two
Is there a market for your game?
00:53 - Once you've decided a specific game you want
to make you have to ask yourself if there
00:57 - are enough people out there who share your
interests
01:00 - You can look at SteamSpy to get a overview
of what games sell in what genres
01:04 - Be honest with yourself about what the size
of the market actually is
01:08 - So for example don't tell yourself that your Adventure game
will somehow appeal to Counter Strike players
01:14 - Question Number Three
Are there similar games that have achieved
01:17 - enough success?
01:18 - This is very much linked to the previous question,
once you've decided that there are people
01:22 - who would be interested it's time to see if
the numbers match up
01:25 - Success in here is relative, for example the
market for point and click is much much smaller
01:30 - than the market for multiplayer first person
shooters
01:33 - So you can see why the big publishers chase
that genre instead of point and clicks
01:38 - It's the only way to get a return on their investment
of hundreds of millions of dollars
01:42 - However if you're working on a simple game
by yourself or with a small team then maybe
01:46 - the market for point and clicks is enough
If your definition of success is 10 thousand
01:50 - copies you have more options than if you require
100 thousand copies to make a profit
01:54 - So look at your desired genre and go through
Steam Spy to see how games of similar level
01:59 - of quality can sell
You need to be brutally honest with yourself,
02:02 - dont just look at the top seller and tell
yourself you'll be fine
02:05 - For example if you're making an Action Platformer
dont look at Dead Cells as proof that it's
02:09 - easy to sell a million copies, instead look
for more reasonable examples
02:13 - Question Number Four
Is your idea unique enough to stand out?
02:17 - This is a tough one since its very much a balancing
act
02:20 - You need to be unique enough to stand out
but not too unique that ends up just confusing
02:24 - your target audience
Making a straight clone is great as a learning
02:28 - experience but it won't find much success
Especially if you don't have a large marketing
02:32 - budget you need something that quickly hooks
potential players
02:36 - The amount of uniqueness you need is also
relative to the genre you have chosen
02:40 - There are thousands of Platformers so it takes
something extremely special to truly stand out
02:45 - The other side of that is you don't need
to be as unique if you're in a less crowded
02:49 - genre since there's less competition
Ask yourself, if you saw an image or a short
02:54 - 5 second clip of your game in action, would
it grab you?
02:57 - Or would you dismiss it as just another game?
03:00 - Question Number Five
Can you make it?
03:03 - This might sound obvious but still is something
you need to ask yourself
03:06 - There certainly is a market for a Open World
Sci Fi RPG but could you actually pull it off?
03:12 - This will naturally depend on the size of
your team and your skill level, if you're
03:15 - working alone or with just one other person
you have to be very careful about the scope
03:19 - you plan for
So once you have a rough idea of what you'd
03:22 - like to do create a small prototype that contains
the essential elements for your game
03:26 - If you think your game will require some really
special AI code or some very fancy shader
03:31 - effects then make sure you quickly see if
it can actually be done before you spend too
03:35 - much time and realize you don't yet have the
necessary skills to bring your vision to life
03:40 - So there you have it, 5 questions to ask yourself
when deciding what you next game will be
03:44 - The more you think about your answers the
better your choice will be
