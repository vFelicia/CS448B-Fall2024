00:00 - hey everyone here's a quick update after
00:02 - a long time of wanting to do it i
00:04 - finally started working on making a
00:05 - complete course
00:06 - actually i've been working on two
00:07 - complete courses first the response to
00:09 - the visual scripting videos was great
00:11 - and there isn't much content on it so
00:13 - several weeks ago i decided to do a
00:14 - complete visual scripting course
00:16 - i really wanted to be an excellent
00:18 - course and very comprehensive
00:19 - so i structured it in such a way that
00:21 - the course involves building not one but
00:23 - three separate games
00:24 - that way you can learn from several
00:26 - different examples which will help you
00:28 - learn how to apply to any game genre you
00:30 - have in mind
00:31 - however as i was working on that course
00:32 - i realized that it was going to end up
00:34 - being massive and take a ton of work
00:36 - and since this would be my very first
00:38 - course i didn't want to risk missing
00:39 - something obvious just because i'm not
00:41 - familiar with the specifics of the
00:42 - process of creating a course
00:44 - so i changed gears and decided to work
00:46 - on a supposedly smaller course
00:48 - so this one is on making a builder
00:50 - defender game using c sharp
00:52 - it is an interesting mix that has
00:54 - helmets from a city builder and a tower
00:56 - defense game
00:57 - so if either of those genres are
00:58 - something you're interested in then this
01:00 - course will provide you with a very nice
01:02 - space to learn from and expand into your
01:04 - own projects
01:05 - with the knowledge gained from this
01:06 - course you'll be able to make city
01:07 - builders rts's tower defense games
01:09 - tycoons village simulators and so on
01:12 - like i said this was meant to be a quick
01:14 - course to test out the whole process but
01:16 - really turned out to be almost as
01:17 - massive
01:18 - as of right now i'm almost done with
01:20 - writing and validating the whole course
01:22 - my normal video tutorials are usually
01:24 - somewhere around two to three hundred
01:26 - lines long
01:27 - and the text for this course is already
01:28 - over six thousand lines long so yeah
01:30 - it's quite a bit more
01:31 - but my main priority is always quality
01:33 - so even though the scope for this course
01:35 - got a bit too
01:35 - large i'm still very happy with the
01:37 - result the game is nice it's fun
01:39 - it's built in a very clean way with all
01:40 - the systems nicely decoupled
01:42 - it's also built in a very modular way so
01:44 - it would be really easy to add more
01:46 - resource types building types and so on
01:48 - my main goal with this course is to
01:50 - gather feedback and apply everything i
01:52 - learned into making the complete visual
01:53 - scripting course better
01:55 - so i will make this one as cheap as
01:56 - possible now with all this talk about
01:58 - courses if you're someone who is only
02:00 - interested in small tutorial videos then
02:02 - don't worry i will still continue making
02:03 - those
02:04 - in fact as i build these courses i'm
02:06 - coming up with lots of topics that would
02:08 - be great as separate videos for example
02:10 - on the builder defender course i made a
02:12 - really awesome shader for constructing a
02:14 - building
02:14 - it's a really awesome effect although
02:16 - it's pretty simple to do so that's
02:18 - exactly the kind of thing that i want to
02:19 - cover in detail in a separate video
02:21 - tutorial
02:22 - so with this video i just wanted to keep
02:23 - you all posted i'm trying to get the
02:25 - courses done
02:26 - and i've done a ton of work these past
02:27 - weeks but since it's my first time i
02:30 - have no idea how much longer it will
02:31 - take
02:32 - if i can get it done by next week then
02:33 - everything will be fine i still have two
02:35 - videos ready to go
02:36 - but if it takes more than that then i
02:38 - may post fewer videos as i finish the
02:39 - course
02:40 - there's links in the description if you
02:42 - want to know more so if you're
02:43 - interested in complete courses
02:45 - or normal video tutorials since i will
02:47 - always continue making those
02:48 - then make sure you're subscribed and hit
02:50 - the bell icon so you get notified when i
02:51 - post new videos
02:53 - alright that's it for me thank you for
02:54 - listening and i'll see you next time
