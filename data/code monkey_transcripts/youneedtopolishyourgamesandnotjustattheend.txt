00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - now if you're regular on the channel
00:03 - then you've certainly heard me talk
00:05 - about the importance of good polish how
00:06 - polish is what separates a good game
00:08 - from a great game of those tiny
00:09 - animations those sounds and flashes that
00:11 - make every action in the game feel
00:12 - really satisfying it's all those same
00:14 - things that make the players think wow
00:15 - this game is really high quality even
00:17 - just while interacting with a simple
00:18 - main menu one game with an excellent
00:20 - amount of polishes valheim just
00:22 - Gathering basic resources in that game
00:24 - feels so satisfying another example is
00:26 - Hearthstone placing down a car or doing
00:28 - some basic attacks just feels awesome
00:30 - and more recently Marvel snap
00:31 - technically it's a simple game with just
00:33 - some cards but again every action has
00:35 - tons of animation and effects to make it
00:37 - feel really powerful so since polish is
00:39 - so important the question is when should
00:41 - you do it now the first obvious answer
00:42 - is we're at the end of the project when
00:44 - the game is saying 90 done and all of
00:46 - the mechanics and systems are
00:47 - implemented then it's a great time to go
00:49 - and publish and add all kinds of tiny
00:50 - things to the game this is another
00:51 - reason why I always encourage you not to
00:53 - just make games but actually finish them
00:55 - as well if you just jump from unfinished
00:57 - prototype to unfinished prototype if you
00:59 - just do that Non-Stop then you never
01:00 - take a project to completion and you
01:02 - never learn the super important part of
01:04 - how to make polish that is a very
01:05 - important stage and learning that comes
01:07 - with experience learning what is Polish
01:09 - or how to polish a game all those tiny
01:11 - things which one should you focus on
01:12 - that is a skill like any other and as
01:14 - with any skill it's a skill that you
01:15 - gain with experience I can say that my
01:17 - very first few games were definitely
01:18 - very unpolished so when your game is
01:20 - close to finish definitely make sure you
01:22 - spend some time doing nothing but polish
01:24 - meaning don't add any more mechanics
01:26 - whatever you have just polish everything
01:28 - to Perfection so the first stage is at
01:30 - the end of the development that is an
01:31 - obvious stage for when you should add
01:33 - polish however there are similar case
01:34 - but it also makes sense and what gave me
01:36 - the idea for this video is because right
01:38 - now I'm actually going through one of
01:39 - those keys myself lately I've been
01:41 - working on polishing demo for my own
01:42 - game Thinking Guardians I published the
01:44 - demo last month and I have kept it up as
01:46 - I update it as I'm going through the
01:47 - development now the game is still quite
01:49 - a bit far away from release the launch
01:50 - it is meant to be just in October so
01:52 - there's still quite a lot of core
01:53 - mechanics that need to be implemented
01:54 - before the final game is released so
01:56 - with that in mind you might question why
01:57 - am I now spending time doing some Polish
01:59 - before all the mechanics are input and
02:01 - the reason is because the demo is still
02:03 - live people are playing the demo and
02:04 - either giving me their direct feedback
02:06 - or I can just look at the analytics to
02:07 - see what parts I need to improve
02:09 - feedback is a crucial part about how to
02:11 - make a great game and if I want to get
02:13 - more feedback then basically I need to
02:14 - ensure that the demo for the game is as
02:16 - polished as can be if people drop off in
02:18 - the first few minutes and I don't really
02:19 - get much feedback so if I want to get
02:21 - more feedback basically I need to make
02:22 - the demo better and right now if I were
02:24 - to work on the missing mechanics that I
02:26 - still need to build things like the
02:27 - interplanetary logistics system if I
02:29 - work on those right now it won't really
02:30 - help me get more feedback if people just
02:32 - quit in the very beginning of demo then
02:34 - they will never reach those points so
02:35 - that is why right now I'm spending some
02:37 - time not a lot just a little bit of time
02:39 - just one to two weeks spending that time
02:40 - just focusing on polishing the main menu
02:42 - and the very beginning of the game I
02:44 - promise the buttons on the main menu so
02:46 - instead of some boring static buttons
02:47 - they now have some nice satisfying
02:49 - animations and sound when you Mouse over
02:50 - and click on them the buttons now also
02:52 - have some proper Sprites and sound
02:53 - effects for the single player menu I
02:55 - also published that instead of just
02:57 - instantly popping in there is now a nice
02:59 - smooth rate of black and then the single
03:01 - player window just comes up really nice
03:03 - with a nice animation again all of these
03:05 - tiny tiny things these are small but
03:07 - these are the kind of things that
03:07 - players notice at least subconsciously
03:09 - which leads them to enjoy the game for
03:11 - quite a bit more which leads them to
03:12 - play longer by the way for handling all
03:14 - these tiny things I'm using the super
03:15 - useful asset calls feel I made NASA
03:17 - review on it in a previous video it's a
03:19 - really awesome asset for example this
03:20 - stage for Polish it makes it really easy
03:22 - to add all of these tiny flashes and
03:24 - animations then I also published the
03:26 - game itself for the tutorial previously
03:27 - just had some boring text on the side
03:29 - whereas now I have some proper tutorial
03:31 - videos and also made a proper UI for it
03:33 - also added some flashing images and a
03:35 - nice animation along with another sound
03:36 - effect again small things but you can
03:38 - see how it makes a huge difference and
03:40 - then I also made some minor tweaks to
03:41 - the tutorial itself to make it more easy
03:43 - to follow like for example the denkis
03:44 - now stay still for one longer while they
03:46 - Patrol an area where I want the player
03:48 - to start Gathering resources that way
03:49 - they never go far away and leads to a
03:51 - lot of confusion for the players there's
03:53 - also a bunch more indicators on various
03:55 - Citron stages again making everything as
03:57 - easy to understand as possible so am I
03:58 - going with this polish is really to help
03:59 - the players enjoy the game as much as
04:01 - possible and keep playing longer which
04:03 - in turn will give me more data and more
04:05 - stats and more feedback to help me make
04:06 - the final game much better so that is
04:08 - the other stage where it also makes
04:09 - sense to have some Polish if you have a
04:11 - public demo like for example if you are
04:13 - participating in a steam festival at
04:14 - that point even if there is still quite
04:16 - a lot of content that you need to build
04:17 - to make the final game instead of
04:18 - working on those missing late game
04:20 - mechanics it might be wise to spend some
04:22 - time just publishing the very beginning
04:23 - of the game in order to ensure you have
04:25 - a great demo in order to get more
04:26 - feedback from your better players in
04:28 - order to help you make the rest of the
04:29 - game better and better now the other
04:31 - stages where it also makes sense to
04:32 - publish are honestly really just
04:33 - variations of this same stage like for
04:35 - example if you're making a Kickstarter
04:37 - nowadays Kickstarter is really crowded
04:39 - it is really difficult to get funding
04:41 - especially if the only thing you have is
04:42 - just a video a lot of players really
04:44 - want to play your game before they
04:46 - decide that they want to fund the game
04:47 - and again for this it is your best
04:49 - option to put your best foot forward so
04:51 - even if only a sliver of the game is
04:53 - actually done it is very wise to spend
04:54 - some time just publishing the part that
04:56 - exists instead of working on lighting
04:57 - mechanics if the players enjoy the
04:59 - kickstart our demo and adding some
05:01 - Polish will help them enjoy it more if
05:03 - they enjoy it then the chances of
05:04 - getting funding go up massively another
05:05 - similar stage is when trying to get
05:07 - funding from a publisher nowadays pretty
05:09 - much you know publisher won't fund you
05:10 - with just video or concept art that is
05:12 - unless you already have a massive
05:14 - pedigree if you have pre-existing
05:15 - contacts or an excellent complete Game
05:17 - portfolio if you don't have that then
05:19 - it's really difficult to get funding
05:20 - without something playable so once again
05:21 - for this use case take what you have and
05:23 - polish it to the maximum once again
05:25 - doing that will greatly increase your
05:26 - odds of signing with the publisher and
05:28 - getting some funding yet not a similar
05:29 - stages when you have a slot on some kind
05:31 - of in-game convention something like the
05:32 - in the mega booth for these you need to
05:34 - have a playable demo that players can
05:36 - actually play on the show 4 and once
05:38 - again this is another scenario where
05:39 - players aren't really going to play your
05:40 - demo for 20 hours straight they're not
05:42 - going to play the entire game just the
05:43 - very beginning so it doesn't matter that
05:45 - your only game mechanics aren't the
05:46 - moment yet what matters is that the very
05:48 - beginning of the game is as excellent as
05:49 - can be if they enjoy the beginning they
05:51 - are going to go home and wishlist the
05:53 - game which then increase your odds of
05:54 - finding success with the final game so
05:55 - yep if you're going to participate in
05:57 - some convention where your game is
05:58 - playable then when preparing the bill
06:00 - for that convention make sure you take
06:02 - some time away from regular development
06:03 - in order to punish what you have to
06:05 - Perfection that will increase player
06:06 - satisfaction which will increase your
06:08 - odds of finding success in that
06:09 - convention so hopefully this helped you
06:11 - see how there are more stages when you
06:12 - should publish your game rather than
06:13 - just at the very end and speaking of
06:15 - Polish go ahead and try out the free
06:17 - demo for my game which now has quite a
06:19 - bit of Polish I hope you'll like it then
06:20 - go ahead and add it to your wishlist
06:21 - alright hope that's useful check out
06:23 - these videos to learn some more thanks
06:25 - to these awesome patreon supporters for
06:27 - making these videos possible thank you
