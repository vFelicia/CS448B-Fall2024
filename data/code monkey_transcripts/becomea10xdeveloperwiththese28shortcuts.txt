00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your codemy here's
00:02 - a super useful video that I've wanted to
00:04 - do for a real long time it's all about
00:06 - the tons of Visual Studio shortcuts that
00:07 - I use all the time which helped me be
00:09 - extremely productive using all of these
00:11 - is definitely one big part of the reason
00:13 - why I managed to make my last game dinky
00:14 - Gardians in just 7 months and I managed
00:16 - to do that despite being a very complex
00:18 - automation management game with hundreds
00:20 - of classes and tens of thousands of Lins
00:22 - of code the more efficient you are at
00:24 - using your tools the faster you can
00:25 - iterate upon your ideas so speed is
00:27 - definitely a very valuable thing and in
00:29 - terms of game development the faster you
00:30 - can make your game the cheaper it will
00:32 - be making it much easier to make
00:33 - profitable games now this video is
00:35 - actually a lecture taken from my
00:37 - upcoming C complete course where you can
00:39 - learn everything from the absolute
00:41 - basics for beginners to more complex
00:42 - topics for advanced users the course has
00:45 - some really nice bonuses with a ton of
00:46 - frequently asked questions there's some
00:48 - fun quizzes and some really interesting
00:50 - interactive exercises to help you truly
00:52 - learn I'm still hard at work on it still
00:54 - have to record a bunch more lectures
00:56 - still have to write a bunch more quizzes
00:57 - and build tons of interactive exercises
00:59 - hope hopefully I will be able to get it
01:01 - all done before the end of February you
01:02 - can sign up with the link description
01:04 - I'll let you know when it's out and if
01:05 - you want to learn specifically about y
01:07 - then check out my ultimate unity
01:08 - overview course covering 70 tools and
01:10 - features the engine has or for a guid
01:12 - path check out my two free course making
01:14 - a game step by step and then making it
01:15 - multiplier okay so let's learn about a
01:17 - ton of super useful shortcuts to help
01:19 - you massively increase your productivity
01:21 - hello and welcome I'm your codm in this
01:23 - lecture we're going to learn about a
01:25 - bunch of really useful Visual Studio
01:26 - shortcuts okay so as we get to the
01:28 - intermediate stage it is it's really
01:30 - important to be good at using your tools
01:32 - and as a programmer your main tool is
01:33 - going to be your ID so you should be
01:35 - very comfortable with shortcuts and
01:37 - moving around your codebase but also
01:38 - this is something that you pick up with
01:40 - experience so this lecture this one is
01:42 - really not meant to be a step-by-step
01:43 - lecture but rather I just want to show
01:45 - you a bunch of shortcuts that I use
01:46 - myself just so you are aware they exist
01:48 - and over time you won't pick them up and
01:50 - they won become more and more natural
01:51 - okay so the most basic but honestly most
01:53 - useful one is simply moving the cursor
01:55 - normally beginners they use the mouse to
01:56 - move around so they scroll down and
01:58 - click wherever they want to write and
02:00 - then sometimes beginners use the arrow
02:01 - keys and they press it like a million
02:03 - times in order to get wherever they want
02:04 - to go technically this works but it's
02:06 - obviously not very efficient there are
02:08 - many ways to speed this up and
02:09 - importantly many ways to navigate your
02:10 - code base without your fingers ever
02:12 - leaving the keyboard for example when
02:14 - moving left to right technically you can
02:15 - indeed just press the right arrow key
02:17 - and eventually you won't get there but
02:19 - as you can see going left to right like
02:20 - this takes quite a while I got to press
02:22 - like something like 50 times in order to
02:24 - get to the beginning or the end so one
02:25 - of the best super simple shortcuts is
02:27 - simply to hold down the control key and
02:28 - now as you move left right yep instead
02:30 - of going letter by letter it goes word
02:32 - by word so that way now I can get to the
02:34 - beginning or the end of this line in
02:35 - just about four or five presses instead
02:37 - of being like literally 50 so it is
02:39 - literally 10 times faster then of course
02:40 - you also have the home and end keys I
02:42 - use these all the time especially when
02:44 - combined with shift for quickly
02:46 - selecting something so for example if I
02:47 - want to move this line above the
02:49 - Southern Line if so then usually what I
02:50 - do is press n to go to the end of this
02:52 - line then hold shift and press up to
02:54 - select and now press end again in order
02:56 - to select just that one then I press CR
02:58 - X to cut I move up press contrl V and
03:00 - yep like that so if you do it pretty
03:02 - quickly it goes quite fast very easy to
03:04 - do all this and again I did all of that
03:07 - without ever my fingers leaving the
03:08 - keyboard if I were to use the mouse I
03:10 - would have to select like this crl x go
03:12 - like this like this so in this case not
03:14 - much of a speed difference but just the
03:16 - fact that your fingers never have to
03:17 - leave the keyboard that alone is a huge
03:19 - bonus and again on all these shortcuts
03:20 - we're going to see how differen is
03:21 - usually pretty small like saving like a
03:23 - second 5 seconds or fractions of a
03:25 - second so that does sound like a super
03:27 - tiny amount but considering how you're
03:29 - probably going to be programming for
03:30 - many years and you're going to write
03:32 - millions of lines of code throughout
03:33 - your entire life when you look at it
03:34 - like that those tiny amounts of time
03:36 - they really add up so that's main thing
03:38 - just moving left and right holding
03:39 - control to go between each word or using
03:42 - end and Home in order to go back to the
03:44 - beginning and the end and combining all
03:45 - of that with shift in order to really
03:47 - move around super quickly so that's the
03:48 - first step and then for something that
03:50 - is sadly not default is moving the
03:51 - cursor up and down so by default if you
03:54 - do that it obviously only moves one line
03:56 - at a time so again the same thing in
03:57 - order to move down 20 or 30 lines it
03:59 - actually takes quite a lot of pressing
04:01 - in order to move and by default the
04:02 - alternative is using page up or page
04:04 - down although personally I'm not a big
04:05 - fan of this I find that these move the
04:07 - cursor way too much so every time I
04:09 - press page down it takes me quite a
04:11 - while to realize where the cursor is and
04:13 - how much actually moved so I don't like
04:14 - how this moves way too much so in my
04:16 - code I added something so that I can
04:18 - move the cursor up and down vertically
04:20 - by just five lines that way I can very
04:22 - easily go down and Contin scrolling down
04:24 - and I'm never lost because the screen
04:26 - never changes a massive amount I'm
04:27 - always moving down moving up select this
04:29 - line of do something move down write
04:31 - something so on now sadly this behavior
04:33 - isn't available by default in Visual
04:35 - Studio at least not that I know of so
04:36 - for this I install this extension called
04:38 - visual Commander this one lets you
04:40 - basically apply some hotkeys to
04:42 - literally anything you can do in visual
04:43 - studio and then with that install just
04:45 - go up here into extensions and here is
04:47 - the V command and on this one here are
04:49 - some commands that I made so here is the
04:50 - window so I've got move up and move down
04:52 - so I can edit in order to see what this
04:54 - is doing and yep it is executing the
04:56 - command line up so literally just moves
04:58 - the line up and the other one this one
04:59 - does the same thing but line down so
05:01 - I've got these two commands here if I
05:03 - have the cursor somewhere and I go into
05:04 - that extension and I use the move up
05:06 - command yep it does move up by six lines
05:08 - so then as you can see I just assigned
05:10 - some keyboard shortcuts to those so
05:12 - control up and control down then I just
05:13 - went into tools options and over here go
05:16 - down into the keyboard shortcuts and
05:18 - then find VSS command and up here
05:20 - command one command two those are two
05:21 - ones that I made and as you can see I've
05:23 - have assign them to control up arrow and
05:24 - control down arrow so all that if I
05:26 - press control up or control down as you
05:28 - can see the cursor moves quite a lot
05:30 - faster so I find this to be much better
05:31 - than just pressing one just moves one
05:33 - line or pressing page up which always
05:35 - causes me to lose and get lost so we
05:37 - just these steps you can see how I can
05:39 - move in the code really fast without
05:40 - ever touching the mouse like let's say I
05:42 - want to go down I want to find for
05:44 - example the awake I want to select the
05:45 - awake I want to cut it and paste it down
05:47 - here and there you go just like this and
05:49 - remove these lines format and so on so
05:50 - as you can see just using these control
05:52 - in order to move between the words using
05:54 - this shortcut in order to move
05:56 - vertically really fast and combined with
05:57 - home and end and with shift and and all
05:59 - that put all those together and yep you
06:01 - can move through the cursor you can move
06:02 - in your code base really quickly without
06:04 - ever leaving the keyboard then of course
06:06 - if you're working on some kind of Big
06:08 - File like for example this is the player
06:09 - class from my steam game dinky Gardens
06:11 - so this is a Prem massive class for this
06:13 - one if I want to get to the bottom and
06:15 - if I go even with this short this is
06:16 - going to take quite a while so for that
06:18 - one if you want to move a massive amount
06:20 - you can use control home or control end
06:22 - order to go to the beginning or the end
06:23 - the file so this is yet another way to
06:25 - very quickly move around and another
06:26 - very useful one for moving around is
06:28 - simply put the cursor on top of some
06:30 - kind of symbol like for example let's
06:31 - say this one this event on player picked
06:34 - up the experience and then if you press
06:35 - control shift and either up or down this
06:38 - will move the cursor to the next or
06:39 - previous reference of that symbol so for
06:41 - example over here you can see how it's
06:42 - really useful how in this huge line of
06:44 - code this script has almost a thousand
06:46 - lines of code but I can very easily see
06:48 - exactly where this one is being
06:49 - referenced I just move up and down yep
06:51 - here is the definition and here is where
06:52 - I'm using it so whenever you want to see
06:54 - all the various places in which you are
06:55 - using some kind of symbol that can be a
06:57 - function can be an event can be variable
06:59 - can be literally anything just hold down
07:01 - control shift and then up and down and
07:03 - you can see all the places in which that
07:04 - symbol is being used then another
07:06 - extremely useful shortcut that I use all
07:08 - the time is control and comma this one
07:10 - pops out this window and now here you
07:12 - can search for any class you just type a
07:14 - name and find it like for example I want
07:16 - to open up the dinky class so I'm going
07:18 - to type in dinky and now just one thing
07:19 - is this shows actually every symbol so
07:22 - in this case in this game since it's all
07:24 - about dinkies I've got tons of
07:25 - references to dinkies so you can see all
07:27 - of these in lower case I usually write
07:29 - my Ables in lowercase so I know that's
07:30 - not the one I know the one that I want
07:32 - in order to open the file is the actual
07:34 - file itself so I can type in dy. CS and
07:36 - yep that does show the file press enter
07:38 - and Y Here I Am the dinky file and again
07:40 - press control home to get the beginning
07:42 - yep here's the dinky definition and I
07:43 - can see all this code just like this so
07:45 - if I want to move to like the tutorial
07:47 - manager so I just write tutorial manager
07:50 - just write a little bit yep I can
07:51 - already see this one so this is the
07:52 - class we can also see the icon over
07:54 - there so that one means a field that one
07:55 - means a class this one means an event
07:57 - and so on so I can see this one press
07:59 - press enter and yep here I am in this
08:00 - one and again move up move down
08:02 - everything works again note how
08:03 - throughout all of this my fingers never
08:05 - leave the keyboard I never touch a mouse
08:07 - so personally whenever I'm making my
08:08 - games and I want to open another class I
08:10 - never go into unity and manually double
08:12 - click on that file I always do it over
08:14 - here press control comma search for
08:15 - anything press enter and it opens or
08:17 - alternatively for example that one that
08:19 - I mentioned when you got tons of
08:20 - references something like over here tons
08:22 - of references to a dinky so I can just
08:23 - go into this one and then I can put the
08:25 - cursor on top of the type itself and I
08:27 - press on F12 and Y this one takes me to
08:29 - the class definition F12 is a shortcut
08:31 - but if you want to use the mouse you can
08:33 - also just right click on it and over
08:34 - here we can see yep F12 is indeed a
08:36 - shortcut to go to definition now since
08:38 - we're here with the mouse one really
08:40 - useful one is over here the find all
08:41 - references when you click on this this
08:43 - going to show all of the references to
08:45 - that type so this can work with whatever
08:47 - is under the cursor so in this case I
08:50 - select the dinky class so this is going
08:51 - to show me all the places in my entire
08:53 - code base where the dinking class is
08:55 - being used or alternatively you can put
08:56 - it just on a field and yep now this one
08:58 - is going to show all the places and you
09:00 - can click in order to automatically go
09:02 - to that line and of course it also works
09:04 - with functions so for example over here
09:05 - this function I'm pressing control shift
09:07 - up and down in order to see all the
09:09 - references within this file but this
09:10 - function is not called from within this
09:11 - file so in order to find where on Earth
09:13 - am I calling this again right click go
09:15 - to references and if I can see okay so
09:17 - it's being called from this script right
09:18 - here inside dinking manager it's calling
09:20 - this function another really useful use
09:22 - case for that particular one is when
09:24 - working with interface so let's say I
09:25 - want to see all the class that implement
09:27 - this interface again right click find
09:29 - all references and if I can see all of
09:31 - these look at these these are all
09:32 - implementing the I interactable
09:34 - interface then something that I use all
09:36 - the time is control RR that is the
09:38 - shortcut for renaming the current symbol
09:40 - so I just place the cursor for example
09:42 - over here on top of the is moving field
09:44 - press control RR and now let's say I
09:45 - want this to be a little bit more
09:47 - descriptive so is player moving so I
09:49 - change that and note how again the other
09:51 - shortcut control shift and up and down
09:53 - note how this one did rename every
09:55 - single reference of this symbol so all
09:57 - of those I don't need to change them
09:58 - just just modify them once use the
10:00 - rename feature and automatically renames
10:02 - all of them and if I find out that the
10:03 - previous one works better again just
10:05 - edit go ahead remove this press enter
10:08 - and yep there you go all of those have
10:09 - now been renamed remember that
10:11 - refactoring isn't extremely important
10:13 - and importantly it's a perfectly normal
10:15 - part of the process in fact the next
10:16 - lecture is entirely dedicated to the
10:18 - topic of refactoring if there is
10:19 - something that you wrote some name but
10:21 - then later on you think it should have a
10:23 - better name just take some time in order
10:25 - to rename it simp place the cursor over
10:26 - it press control RR write the new name
10:29 - and it will automatically rename every
10:31 - instance of that symbol this works on
10:32 - everything everything from simple
10:34 - variables to even entire classes and it
10:36 - even renames every single reference in
10:37 - your entire codebase so for example here
10:39 - I am on the dinky class which is used
10:41 - throughout the entirety of this code
10:42 - base I can press control RR and I can
10:45 - modify this whole thing and say
10:47 - something and Y like it says here rename
10:48 - will update 297 references in 58 files
10:51 - so this rename feature is really awesome
10:53 - really useful it automatically handles
10:55 - modifying everything and everything is
10:57 - handled automatically for you then when
10:59 - you have multiple windows open for
11:00 - moving between them you can use control
11:02 - tab if you just use one it goes back and
11:05 - forth between the last open tab so this
11:06 - is something that I use all the time
11:08 - whenever I'm working between two files
11:10 - and I want to quickly move between them
11:12 - but instead of doing just that and
11:13 - letting go you can hold down control and
11:15 - tab and as long as you hold down control
11:17 - you can see this window and over here
11:19 - you can move up or down in order to move
11:21 - between all the various windows that you
11:22 - will have open so for example let's say
11:24 - I want to go into dinky off world yep
11:25 - there you go now I'm looking at this
11:27 - class and if I quickly control tab I go
11:29 - back into the previous class and this
11:31 - tab over here this one only works for
11:33 - the windows that are open so again the
11:34 - same thing if you want to open up a new
11:36 - window just press control comma open the
11:38 - window let's say for example I want to
11:40 - find the carry vehicle so I just type in
11:42 - the carry vehicle yep it's right here
11:43 - control enter and this one opens up the
11:45 - carry vehicle class now control Tab and
11:47 - off I want I go back into the dink key
11:48 - and move between them like that then
11:50 - here's a really simple one you can raise
11:52 - an entire line by just having the cursor
11:54 - anywhere on that line pressing contr X
11:56 - that one cuts the entire line that one
11:58 - acts as a cut meaning if you press
12:00 - contrl + V you get the line back
12:01 - alternatively for duplicating you can
12:03 - press contr D although honestly I rarely
12:05 - ever use this one because I can never
12:07 - remember whether it's going to duplicate
12:09 - on the line above or below it so usually
12:11 - if I want to duplicate something I just
12:13 - do the shortcuts that I mentioned a
12:14 - while ago so end above end cut move cut
12:17 - and so on now speaking of copy paste if
12:19 - you press control shift and V if you do
12:22 - that you get an list of your clipboard
12:24 - history so for example a while ago I
12:26 - showed cutting the awake class and yep
12:28 - it is still saved in here so if I press
12:29 - on enter yep it paste that one EXA like
12:31 - that so remember that your clipboard has
12:33 - history it is not just the last thing
12:34 - that you copied you can access the
12:36 - entire history another useful tiny time
12:38 - saer is actually when using the mouse
12:40 - when using that if you want to select
12:42 - some kind of word some kind of symbol
12:43 - obviously you can do the basic thing
12:45 - which is just click and hold and drag
12:47 - throughout to select it so obviously
12:48 - that works but it's a little bit fiddly
12:50 - if you move up or down can be quite
12:52 - tricky so the similar shortcut for that
12:53 - whenever you want to select some kind of
12:55 - word you can just double click and it
12:56 - selected or alternatively hold down
12:58 - control and click in order to select the
12:59 - entire thing this can be quite useful
13:01 - for example when you have some copy
13:03 - pasted code and you want to change some
13:04 - kind of name but for some reason the
13:06 - rename function doesn't work like for
13:08 - example let's say I want to duplicate
13:09 - this code over here so right now I
13:11 - cannot use the rename because this one
13:12 - is going to conflict with that one so
13:14 - instead let's say the active dinky list
13:17 - so I press I select this one control
13:19 - click and there you go like that and if
13:20 - I want like that so control click in
13:22 - order to do control V and so on this one
13:24 - can be quite useful sometimes then
13:26 - something that I only very rarely use is
13:28 - shift and ALT hold those and then move
13:30 - upward down and this one basically lets
13:32 - you select multiple lines of code and
13:34 - edit them at the same time like I said I
13:36 - rarely use this but sometimes can be
13:38 - useful for example for quickly appending
13:40 - or removing some kind of prefix like for
13:42 - example on this enum I've got these
13:43 - values I want to write all them and say
13:45 - tier one tier two and so on so I can
13:47 - select all lines and write tier and
13:49 - writes on all of them or alternatively
13:50 - if this one did have it now I want to
13:52 - remove them just select them all and I
13:53 - can remove them so basally you can write
13:55 - code on multiple lines at the same time
13:56 - and if you want to quit this just press
13:58 - escape and yep back back into a single
13:59 - cursor another Super useful one is when
14:01 - working with events like for example the
14:03 - on any dinky started starving so I can
14:05 - just write the event name then plus
14:07 - equals and then here Visual Studio
14:09 - automatically has a shortcut so you can
14:10 - press tab to insert then if you want you
14:12 - can rename it but usually I keep the
14:14 - exact same name that it suggests so just
14:16 - press enter and Y there you go I've got
14:18 - a new event now I can come here and
14:19 - again use a shortcut contr X to get rid
14:21 - of that go above go to the end press
14:23 - enter go to new line then write some new
14:25 - code so really useful and if you
14:27 - afterwards you decide that you want a
14:29 - better name for this event again
14:31 - remember just say quick control RR in
14:32 - order to rename then if you want to find
14:34 - something of course you have crlf for
14:36 - example finding when I'm invoking some
14:38 - kind of vent so just write invoke and if
14:40 - it finds it obviously normal then the
14:42 - shortcut for going to the next element
14:44 - that one is pressing on F3 and it goes
14:46 - to the next one so it finds that one
14:47 - that one that one and so on in order to
14:48 - go to the previous one you use shift F3
14:50 - and it goes backwards also by the way
14:52 - this works whether the control F window
14:54 - is open over there but if I press ones
14:56 - in order to close down that window and
14:57 - with this if I press on F3 three yep it
14:59 - still remembers the last thing that I
15:00 - searched then for quickly commenting or
15:02 - uncommenting something you can do
15:04 - control KC and yep it automatically
15:06 - comments that entire line and if you
15:08 - have multiple lines selected contrl KC
15:10 - yep automatically comments and the
15:11 - opposite to uncomment is contrl Ku and
15:14 - yep automatically uncommons St although
15:15 - personally I never really use this one
15:17 - myself again it goes back to how I'm so
15:19 - proficient at just moving the cursor so
15:21 - if I just want to comment all of these I
15:22 - just do the common star go down there
15:25 - common star there you go just like this
15:26 - another useful shortcut is extract
15:28 - method so you can select a whole bunch
15:30 - of code then press control R and M and
15:33 - this one creates a new method with that
15:34 - code so let's say setup and if there you
15:36 - go pretty much took that code and placed
15:37 - it in its own method so this can
15:39 - sometimes be useful although again this
15:41 - is another one that I don't really use
15:42 - myself because again I'm pretty fast at
15:44 - just moving the cursor so if I want to
15:45 - do this kind of thing I really just go
15:47 - into the code that I want I just go I
15:49 - use I move the cursor move up move down
15:51 - then do private void my setup do some
15:54 - kind of function then write it just like
15:56 - this and everything works if you want to
15:58 - go to a certain line you can press
15:59 - control and G this one lets you input
16:01 - some kind of line number so let's say
16:03 - let's see what is at line 500 so I just
16:05 - type in 500 and Y there you go here we
16:07 - are on line 500 now for this one
16:09 - normally I don't really use it when
16:11 - writing code but I do use this one quite
16:13 - a lot when writing the text script for
16:14 - my courses since normally I write my
16:16 - course in a simple text file sometimes
16:18 - it has tens of thousands of lines so for
16:20 - that usually I like to move around by
16:21 - using the line number although in the
16:23 - code I never really have such massive
16:24 - files so I don't normally tend to use it
16:26 - but it's only nice thing to know then of
16:28 - course one that you already know if you
16:29 - make some kind of mistake contrl Zed in
16:31 - order to undo and one you might not know
16:33 - is control shift Zed in order to redo
16:36 - then for moving between visual student
16:37 - Unity just a simple all tab so just once
16:40 - and moves or if you have multiple files
16:41 - just keep pressing Tab and perhaps the
16:43 - simplest and most useful one is simply
16:45 - autocomplete I really advise you to get
16:47 - comfortable with how autocomplete Works
16:49 - learn how to just type a few lectures
16:51 - and then I to press enter or dot or
16:53 - semicolon in order to quickly
16:54 - autocomplete honestly I don't remember
16:56 - the last time there were something like
16:57 - for example try get component I just try
16:59 - a little bit and write like that for
17:01 - example dinky just like this then out
17:03 - Dinky Dinky just like this super simple
17:06 - so just get used with how little you
17:08 - have to write in order to press enter in
17:10 - order to automatically write everything
17:11 - else this works with Fields but
17:13 - obviously it also works with things like
17:14 - functions it works with classes it works
17:16 - with literally anything okay so that was
17:18 - a lot of shortcuts personally I use a
17:20 - lot of these all the time but again I've
17:22 - been writing code for over 25 years if
17:24 - you're not used to using shortcuts then
17:26 - I really don't expect you to suddenly
17:27 - use all of these right away all at once
17:29 - like I said this lecture this one is
17:31 - really not meant to be a step-by-step
17:32 - lecture for the most part right now I
17:34 - just want you to memorize the first ones
17:35 - that I mentioned about how to move
17:37 - through the cursor quickly just memorize
17:39 - those and simply remember that the other
17:40 - ones exist then periodically come back
17:42 - to this lecture every once in a while
17:43 - and watch it again if you do that
17:45 - several times over the next few months
17:46 - then soon enough all of these shortcuts
17:48 - that I mentioned all these will be
17:49 - natural to you just like they are to me
17:51 - all right so that was a lecture taken
17:53 - from my upcoming C course I really hope
17:55 - you found it useful you can sign up to
17:57 - be notified when the course is out with
17:58 - the link in the description it will
18:00 - teach you everything about C starting
18:02 - from the absolute Basics to some more
18:03 - advanced topics so regardless of your
18:05 - skill level I am certain you will learn
18:07 - something new all right so thanks for
18:08 - watching and I'll see you next time
