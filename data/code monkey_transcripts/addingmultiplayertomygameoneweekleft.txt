00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and here's how I added multiplayer to my
00:03 - game now thankfully because netcode for
00:05 - game objects is pretty easy to use this
00:07 - was much easier than I expected in the
00:09 - last that long I thought it would take
00:10 - maybe an entire week to get this
00:11 - implement but in reality it only took
00:13 - about two days it was mostly pretty easy
00:15 - although at the same time I did
00:16 - encounter a few bugs that almost drove
00:18 - me insane but it is working right now
00:20 - which is great because the clock is
00:21 - taking the demo needs to be out by next
00:23 - Monday so I've got no time left and this
00:26 - is also a great time to have some
00:27 - discussion around when should you
00:29 - implement multiplayer to your own games
00:30 - so should you do it right from the start
00:32 - as soon as you start building the game
00:34 - or should you do it just like it did
00:35 - over here which is first build a bunch
00:37 - of systems in single player and then add
00:38 - multiplayer both options have their pros
00:41 - and cons so let me tell you my thoughts
00:42 - but before all that let me just say
00:44 - thank you all so much for your feedback
00:45 - on the last video using this format
00:47 - there was lots of feedback specifically
00:49 - based on the audio so I'm trying to fix
00:50 - that I'm trying to make this room a bit
00:52 - less echoey and also got a little thing
00:54 - for the microphone which I'm hoping
00:55 - helps at the same time I'm also going to
00:57 - try the Tonk without moving my hand way
00:59 - too much and secondly only people
01:00 - mentioned how the editing was a bit too
01:01 - much I was jumping around all over the
01:03 - place so I toned that down a bit and
01:05 - made this video a bit more calm once
01:07 - again thank you all for your comments
01:08 - and as usual keep letting me know what
01:10 - you think and also at the same time let
01:11 - me say thank you all for all your
01:13 - answers with regards to my design
01:14 - questions that I posed in the previous
01:15 - video there were so many interesting
01:17 - things that I hadn't thought about at
01:18 - all like for example with my questions
01:20 - with regards to how do I Implement tools
01:22 - for the player in the inventory for that
01:23 - some people suggest the game astroneer
01:25 - which is really awesome I love playing
01:26 - that game and that game does have a
01:28 - really interesting backpack system I
01:29 - love how physical it is then for the
01:32 - resource spawn areas some people
01:33 - mentioned how just painting the terrain
01:35 - in a different way or maybe having a
01:37 - tower that sends out pulses or perhaps
01:39 - even a dinky that goes out and finds
01:40 - stuff then with regards to the heat
01:42 - mechanic someone suggests the word
01:43 - threat which makes a lot more sense so
01:45 - thanks for that all in all lots of
01:47 - excellent discussion reading all these
01:48 - comments really got my brain going so
01:50 - this has been wonderful in terms of
01:51 - brainstorming great design ideas that
01:53 - video got so many comments way too many
01:55 - to keep track so apologies if I miss
01:56 - your comment and thanks again okay so
01:58 - multiplayer now adding this this was
02:00 - very interesting in the beginning
02:02 - getting the basics working was super
02:03 - easy barely an inconvenience but then
02:05 - afterwards I also encountered tons of
02:07 - bugs with netcode for game objects which
02:09 - drove me crazy for quite some time it
02:11 - took tons of trial and error although in
02:12 - the end I did get it working hopefully
02:14 - by sharing my experience and how I ended
02:16 - up solving them will help you so you
02:17 - don't go crazy if you also try doing
02:19 - this now before I implemented anything
02:20 - just as a quick refresher I went ahead
02:22 - and I re-watched my own netcode for game
02:24 - objects video as well as my free
02:26 - multiplayer course honestly this is one
02:28 - of the best ways about making
02:29 - educational content when I need to
02:31 - relearn something I can just go re-watch
02:33 - my own videos and obviously they are
02:35 - presenting the perfect way that I like
02:36 - to learn and at the same time it also
02:38 - didn't take that long normally I watch
02:39 - every YouTube video on about 2x speed
02:41 - but since it's my own video and I'm
02:43 - really just re-watching to get a quick
02:45 - refresh here I managed to watch them at
02:46 - 3xpin so I ended up seeing my own NGO
02:49 - tutorial as well as my complete
02:51 - multiplayer course I end up watching all
02:53 - of that in about 2 hours definitely
02:54 - really useful as a great quick refresh
02:56 - you to remember how everything works now
02:58 - for implement the basics like that it
03:00 - was super easy first I just cleaned up
03:02 - the hierarchy and got rid of everything
03:03 - that wasn't absolutely necessary I just
03:06 - added the network manager I added some
03:07 - testing UI and I also installed the
03:09 - quantum console for making it super easy
03:11 - to debug then just added some basic
03:13 - components so I added the network
03:14 - objects for everything at the network
03:16 - transform Network rigid body in most
03:18 - cases it's just adding those components
03:19 - was more than enough to get everything
03:21 - working perfectly although at the same
03:22 - time I also got an error right away so
03:24 - in single player in order to carry the
03:26 - objects I was modifying the parent for
03:27 - the object but of course in multiplayer
03:29 - changing parents that is something that
03:31 - is almost very tricky so it's something
03:32 - you should avoid doing so after getting
03:34 - a quick error I just ended up doing exam
03:36 - like I did in my multiplayer course
03:37 - meaning I just have a simple script that
03:39 - just takes a Target transform and simply
03:41 - follows that position perfectly then I
03:43 - just converted some scripts to network
03:44 - Behavior I added some is owner checks
03:47 - and up with that very quickly I had the
03:49 - core of it working perfectly all of it
03:51 - is being synchronized across multiple
03:52 - builds setting all this up only took
03:54 - about 22 hours really fast thanks to our
03:56 - NGO is super easy to use and thanks to
03:58 - re-watching my own multiplayer
04:00 - with the base is working then I need the
04:02 - connection scene flow meaning I want the
04:03 - player to start from the main menu then
04:05 - go into the lobby scene then into the
04:07 - character select scene and finally into
04:08 - the game scene and thankfully for that
04:10 - it was also super easy basically I just
04:12 - copied all that logic directly from my
04:14 - free multiplayer course it just required
04:16 - some very minor refactoring since all
04:17 - the code in those three scenes all of
04:19 - those scripts are already very nicely
04:21 - self-contained I just removed references
04:23 - to Kitchen objects and renamed them with
04:25 - that the basic main menu was working
04:26 - perfectly the lobby scene was working
04:28 - great I could create and join lobbies
04:30 - the relay was also working and the
04:32 - character selection scene as well now I
04:34 - only talk about the importance of
04:35 - writing good clean code and this is yet
04:37 - another practical example of why that is
04:39 - by reusing code and systems that you've
04:41 - made previously you can massively
04:43 - increase your productivity and if you
04:44 - write the code correctly with as few
04:45 - depends as possible it makes it super
04:47 - easy to reuse that same code in montemon
04:49 - projects now if I were building this
04:51 - entire main menu pause Lobby plus
04:52 - characters like and so on if I were
04:54 - building all this from scratch it would
04:55 - have taken probably a week whereas
04:57 - thanks to being able to reuse all this I
04:59 - was able to build all this in literally
05:01 - one hour so once again another very
05:03 - practical example of the power of
05:04 - writing good clean code and how if you
05:06 - do things correctly you can make
05:07 - yourself much much more productive now
05:09 - while implementing that part was super
05:10 - easy I also did have a ton of very
05:13 - strange bugs I was going crazy for about
05:15 - six hours straight I really have no idea
05:17 - what was happening I was getting random
05:18 - bugs after random bugs and worst of all
05:20 - it was all related to the NGO package
05:22 - itself and not exactly my own code so
05:24 - that makes it super hard to debug and of
05:26 - course being in multiplayer being
05:27 - between a server and a client that makes
05:30 - debugging even more hard basically when
05:32 - I have some bug that only happens on the
05:34 - client there's no sack tricks because
05:35 - the client don't receive the message so
05:37 - I have no idea what went wrong in
05:38 - between the server and the client so it
05:40 - was extremely difficult to fix all the
05:42 - issues that I was Finding I had one
05:43 - where everything was working perfectly
05:45 - and then all of a sudden everything
05:46 - stopped working after getting crazy for
05:48 - many hours it turns out the answer was
05:49 - somehow related to the network manager I
05:52 - still have no idea exactly what happened
05:53 - there but it turns out the solution was
05:55 - simply to unpack the prefab as soon as I
05:57 - did that everything suddenly started
05:59 - working another strange one was the
06:01 - objects placed on the actual scene
06:02 - itself those suddenly stopped working it
06:04 - has something to do with the prefabs
06:05 - being placed in the scene it worked for
06:07 - the spawned objects but the ones that
06:09 - were placed on the scene by default
06:10 - those for some reason those had a weird
06:11 - bug it turns out that for some reason
06:13 - the network object component got bugged
06:15 - in some way I have no idea how but
06:17 - apparently the solution was simply
06:19 - removed the network object component and
06:20 - re-added literally that's it there's no
06:22 - other change and just doing that for
06:24 - some reason fix that then I got yet
06:26 - another strange one which is if the
06:28 - client connects while the server is in
06:30 - the middle of spawning objects if so
06:31 - then for some reason the client that is
06:33 - actually connecting that one decides to
06:35 - spawn some objects and then try to
06:36 - destroy them now of course the client
06:38 - cannot destroy things so that caused an
06:39 - error again this was insane to debug
06:41 - because I cannot follow the stack trace
06:43 - on the client itself I can see the
06:44 - client is getting an error but I have no
06:46 - idea where that came from in server now
06:48 - thankfully for this range one I did
06:49 - manage to find the solution and the
06:50 - solution was simply just pause the game
06:52 - as soon as the client is connecting so
06:54 - on the connection approval compact as
06:55 - soon as the server sees that someone is
06:56 - trying to connect it is going to pause
06:58 - the game that way it ensures that
06:59 - nothing is being spawned in the middle
07:01 - and then as soon as the client connects
07:02 - then it resumes the game again another
07:04 - extremely strange bug no idea what
07:06 - causes since the client should never be
07:07 - spawning any objects but spawning it
07:09 - while the client is connecting for some
07:11 - reason that sounds it so that's good and
07:13 - with all that done there is still one
07:14 - more bug that I just cannot solve no
07:15 - matter what for some reason it has to do
07:17 - with the network animator however even
07:19 - more strange it only happens if I start
07:21 - the game from the game scene itself if I
07:23 - start from the main menu itself and I go
07:25 - through the entire connection file if I
07:27 - do that and there's no bug but if I
07:29 - start from the game scene there's a bug
07:30 - again really no idea what caused this
07:33 - one really no idea what is going on but
07:35 - thankfully since this one is on the
07:36 - player animator it doesn't really break
07:37 - anything so in this case my simple
07:39 - installation is really just ignore this
07:41 - bug and hope that nothing else breaks
07:42 - honestly I really have no clue what
07:44 - happened with all these bugs when I was
07:46 - making the multiplayer cores I worked on
07:48 - it for quite a long time and I didn't
07:49 - have any of these issues so I have no
07:51 - idea if I was just extremely unlucky and
07:53 - the most random things happen maybe it
07:55 - was because that other one kitchen chaos
07:57 - Zone was a much more simple game and one
07:59 - very important difference is on that one
08:00 - I decided to not allow only joining
08:02 - whereas for this one I decided to do all
08:04 - of that I do want the players to be able
08:05 - to join one of the game is actually in
08:07 - session and here are lots of issues with
08:09 - you to spawning objects in the middle of
08:10 - the game actually playing either way
08:12 - thankfully after all that stress after
08:14 - me going crazy for several hours
08:15 - thankfully now the game is solid I can
08:17 - play there are no issues and everything
08:18 - is nicely synchronized the starring
08:21 - objects are on there in the beginning
08:22 - and then the ones that spawn afterwards
08:24 - the player can actually join late and
08:25 - everything is synchronized correctly so
08:27 - thankfully the multiplayer build is now
08:28 - in a good state so I can continue
08:30 - developing the game also here's a super
08:32 - useful and quick tip for working with
08:34 - custom types with network for game
08:35 - objects as you might know you cannot use
08:37 - every single type in an RPC call for
08:39 - example you cannot pass in a script or
08:41 - an object referenced the alternative is
08:43 - with the special Network object
08:44 - reference or network Behavior reference
08:46 - however for something like a certain
08:48 - object for that one you can't pass in
08:50 - directly but there is actually a more
08:52 - advanced method where you can actually
08:53 - apply custom serialization to any of
08:55 - your types and doing that is actually
08:57 - not difficult at all I just created this
08:59 - last for the serial about extensions now
09:01 - if you don't know about extension
09:02 - methods you should definitely look into
09:03 - them they are a super useful c-sharp
09:05 - feature by using that according to the
09:07 - docs I was able to implement these two
09:09 - extensions I extend the function for
09:11 - reading and a function for writing so
09:12 - serializing and deserializing this
09:14 - custom object to handle the
09:15 - serialization I basically just converted
09:17 - into an index and back from it so I just
09:19 - got a script more object that actually
09:20 - holds a list of all the very script mode
09:22 - objects and using that index that index
09:24 - is a simple end so I can easily
09:26 - serialize and deserialize that so with
09:28 - that everything works so I can read I
09:30 - can write and with that I can now use my
09:32 - script objects directly in any RPC and
09:34 - anything I want however for using it in
09:36 - a natural variable for that one requires
09:38 - one extra step here is the documentation
09:40 - and here is the implementation as you
09:41 - can see it's on pretty simple with all
09:43 - this I can now use any of these script
09:45 - more object types in my actual RPC and
09:47 - network variables which does simplify
09:49 - the multiple logic by quite a bit now to
09:51 - answer that question that I mentioned in
09:52 - the beginning so should you build
09:54 - multiplayer games just like I did here
09:56 - meaning make a bunch of systems make
09:58 - them all working right at once and then
10:00 - work on converting them to multiplayer
10:01 - or should we instead start with
10:03 - multiplayer right from the very
10:04 - beginning honestly this is one of those
10:06 - questions where there really isn't an
10:07 - objective answer I think the answer
10:09 - mostly comes down to experience if you
10:11 - are a beginner or a semi beginner then I
10:13 - think the better option is to start from
10:14 - multiplayer right from the start adding
10:16 - multiplayer after everything is built
10:17 - that makes everything quite a bit more
10:19 - difficult debugging even simple issues
10:21 - becomes quite complex and if you don't
10:23 - have enough debugging experience that
10:24 - can be very very challenging all these
10:26 - strange issues that I mentioned if I had
10:28 - tried to debug those 10 years ago when I
10:30 - had much less experience if I had done
10:32 - that it would have probably taken me
10:33 - perhaps an entire month to fix all those
10:35 - issues whereas with the unlevel
10:37 - experience that I have nowadays
10:38 - thankfully I was able to solve all of
10:40 - those very strange issues in a few hours
10:41 - whereas if you start with multiplayer
10:43 - right from the very beginning if you do
10:45 - that then you manage to implement one
10:47 - feature at a time so you never end up
10:48 - with a mountain of issues all at once
10:50 - taking Tiny Steps like that won't be
10:52 - much much easier rather than what I did
10:53 - here which was build a ton of systems
10:55 - and then work on converting every single
10:57 - one of those to multiplier but as you
10:58 - can see that method can also work I do
11:00 - have a functioning multiplayer game
11:02 - right now now for me I was confident in
11:04 - my own skills and my own abilities so
11:05 - that is why I was comfortable with first
11:07 - making the game and then converting it
11:08 - to multiplayer but if you are much less
11:10 - experienced then yes I would highly
11:11 - recommend you start with multiplayer
11:13 - right from the very beginning as soon as
11:15 - you start the project install the
11:16 - netcode package right away and start
11:18 - making it multiplayer then for
11:19 - everything on Tiny system that you
11:21 - change make sure the change works both
11:22 - in single player and in multiplayer
11:24 - doing it like that is much much easier
11:26 - than trying to convert the entire
11:27 - project into multiplier even though like
11:29 - I said the alternative can also work now
11:31 - with all that the game is now playable
11:33 - in multiplayer so everything is in a
11:34 - functional state so I finally made the
11:36 - build and sent it over for Seam for
11:38 - approval an actually fun fact after 24
11:40 - hours they actually review the build and
11:42 - they declined it the reason is because
11:44 - the build that is pretty much just the
11:45 - bare bones functionality so it doesn't
11:47 - actually have all the features that I'm
11:49 - going to implement by the time the demo
11:50 - comes out next week so for example the
11:52 - build that I submit for review does not
11:54 - have controller support and does not
11:55 - have pointer customization I will
11:57 - Implement those by the time the festival
11:58 - release comes out but for now in order
12:00 - to get through the build approval
12:02 - process for that I simply just remove
12:03 - those from the store page so it can pass
12:05 - correctly alright so now the build is
12:07 - working and I still got a massive amount
12:08 - of work to do the clock is ticking and I
12:10 - got less than a week to get the entire
12:12 - demo fully up and running I have to
12:14 - somehow put the rest of the mechanics
12:16 - that I need to add and somehow put them
12:17 - all together into one cohere and demo
12:19 - experience and also I might need some
12:21 - play tires just to make sure that all
12:22 - the connection everything works
12:24 - perfectly so if you're interested stay
12:25 - tuned for some random live streams
12:27 - sometime by the end this week where I
12:29 - will ask some people to install the game
12:30 - just to make sure that all the
12:32 - connection all of that works perfectly
12:33 - before the festival starts okay so now I
12:35 - gotta quickly finish recording this I
12:37 - gotta quickly edit this video and
12:38 - publish it so that I can get back to
12:39 - work go ahead and add dinky Guardians
12:41 - here wishlist if you haven't already
12:42 - thank you so much for watching and I'll
12:44 - see you next time
12:56 - all right
