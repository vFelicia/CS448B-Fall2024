00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - so i finally got around to watching
00:03 - squid game to see what all the hype is
00:05 - about and i have to say the hype is
00:06 - definitely deserved i watched the whole
00:08 - thing in just one day very captivating
00:10 - from start to finish and of course since
00:12 - this channel is all about game
00:13 - development and the show is about a game
00:15 - then i thought why don't i try to make
00:16 - it as a video game but i also thought
00:18 - that just doing the obvious and making a
00:20 - game where you play as the players is a
00:22 - bit too obvious plenty of people have
00:23 - already done that so instead here's how
00:26 - i made the game where you play as the
00:27 - guards and your goal is to stop the
00:28 - players i think that's a nice twist and
00:30 - the final game came out really well in
00:32 - total it took me about 20 hours to build
00:34 - this so let's see how i made it and in
00:36 - the end you can go play it for yourself
00:38 - and see if you can beat my high score if
00:40 - you prefer a more guided path with
00:42 - step-by-step lectures then check out my
00:44 - complete courses learn how to make a
00:46 - bundler defender game using c sharp just
00:48 - like i make my own steam games or learn
00:51 - how to make games internally using
00:52 - visual scripting or learn all about
00:54 - unity with the ultimate overview course
00:56 - which contains over 13 lectures each
00:58 - covering a different tool or feature of
01:00 - the engine to help you make better games
01:02 - faster i'm always available in the
01:03 - courses q a section answering your
01:05 - questions every single day so check out
01:07 - all the courses with the link in the
01:08 - description ok so i start off like i
01:10 - start off all of my games just designing
01:12 - on paper start writing down some ideas
01:15 - of how i could make an interesting game
01:17 - where you play as the guards and
01:18 - initially the goal was to remake all the
01:20 - games but then i thought about one of
01:22 - the most important things you should do
01:23 - as a game developer and that is managing
01:25 - scope so i decided to focus on just one
01:28 - game and make it as best as i can
01:30 - recently i was working on a video on how
01:32 - to make a riflescope zoom effect that
01:34 - reminded me of playing desperados and
01:36 - commandos as a kid and those games had a
01:38 - really nice top-down rifle scope
01:40 - mechanic so i immediately thought that
01:42 - would be perfect for the very first game
01:44 - red light green light i started writing
01:46 - down ideas for how i could make that
01:48 - design work from the perspective of one
01:49 - of the guards how it would look like
01:51 - what are the mechanics wind loose
01:53 - conditions and so on then with the basic
01:55 - design defined i got to work and start a
01:57 - new unity project
01:59 - now the map is a pretty crucial part of
02:00 - the game so the first thing i did is set
02:02 - up the layout and the scale
02:04 - in the show there's about a dozen guards
02:06 - shooting the players but in here there's
02:08 - only just one guard so the scale and
02:10 - number of players need to match that if
02:12 - it's too big then it becomes very
02:13 - frustrating and there's lots of empty
02:15 - space but at the same time if it's too
02:17 - small then aiming becomes almost
02:18 - irrelevant so i played around a bit with
02:21 - the map in order to get the correct
02:22 - scale
02:23 - then when that was settled i started
02:25 - gathering some visuals now usually when
02:27 - i make my own games i tend to leave the
02:29 - visuals to the very end for example my
02:31 - last game battleground tycoon looked
02:33 - like this until about two months before
02:35 - lunch but here since i'm making this
02:37 - game and recording the process of making
02:39 - this video it wouldn't look too boring
02:41 - if i just had some basic cubes until the
02:43 - end so in order to make this video more
02:45 - interesting i went and got some visuals
02:47 - right away
02:48 - first thing i made was the background
02:50 - looking at the show it's just a bunch of
02:51 - dried grass initially i thought about
02:54 - taking a screenshot from the show but
02:55 - then i thought it would be much better
02:56 - if i just built that image in unity and
02:58 - took a screenshot so i just grabbed a
03:00 - simple grass asset that i picked up in a
03:03 - previous sale set it up in a terrain
03:05 - with the correct colors and took a
03:06 - picture thankfully this game is pretty
03:08 - simple in terms of visuals then for the
03:10 - characters i am definitely not a 3d
03:12 - modeler so i just browsed my asset list
03:14 - looking for something similar i found
03:16 - one character with some overalls so i
03:18 - picked that and just recolored the
03:20 - texture it's pretty simple but i think
03:22 - it looks good pretty similar to the show
03:24 - so honestly this is a great example of
03:26 - how you don't need to know every single
03:28 - skill and how you can use assets
03:30 - correctly even if you don't know 3d
03:32 - modeling you can still make quite a
03:34 - bunch of stuff by just grabbing some
03:35 - pre-made assets recalling texture and
03:38 - maybe even using pro bundler to change a
03:39 - few things
03:40 - just make sure when you use the assets
03:42 - make sure that they fit your game
03:44 - otherwise don't look like an asset flip
03:46 - so with that done i then got to work on
03:48 - the main mechanic the zoom effect the
03:50 - idea for this minigame came right away
03:52 - since i had just done that riflescope
03:54 - tutorial
03:55 - in that video i covered three methods
03:57 - with different pros and cons and here i
03:59 - went with the third method the one with
04:01 - the best visuals it used a second camera
04:03 - and a rendered texture
04:05 - then also just added some depth of field
04:06 - effect and some simple logic along with
04:08 - an animation for bringing up the scope
04:10 - and just with that it already looked
04:12 - pretty good i can bring up the scope and
04:14 - zoom in on any of the players
04:16 - now up until this point everything was
04:18 - fixed so the next step was making a
04:19 - simple camera control i used the super
04:22 - useful syn machine package just made a
04:24 - dummy game object and set the camera to
04:26 - follow it then just a very simple script
04:28 - to move and rotate the object and the
04:30 - camera follows along so it's pretty much
04:32 - the exact same thing that i covered in
04:33 - the third person shooter video
04:35 - it's a super simple method and works
04:37 - great and at this point i could now
04:39 - rotate the camera so it was time to add
04:41 - some visuals to the other side of the
04:42 - map first up making the guards again i
04:45 - just grabbed the exact same character
04:47 - model that i used for the players i just
04:49 - painted the texture in pink then i had
04:51 - the simple mask and a helmet
04:53 - now to make the helmet look like a
04:55 - hoodie i just use pro builder in order
04:57 - to drag the edges down then 3 is also a
04:59 - pretty simple one i've got tons of
05:01 - assets i've picked up from previous
05:02 - sales and bundles so i just need to
05:04 - search for it by the way if you find the
05:06 - video helpful please hit the like button
05:08 - it's a tiny thing but it really does
05:09 - help thanks and finally for the doll i
05:12 - tried searching for an actual doll in my
05:13 - assets but i couldn't find anything
05:15 - however i did have some very low poly
05:18 - characters which i think looked pretty
05:19 - don't like so i grabbed it record the
05:22 - textures and set up the scale then just
05:24 - made two simple animations just rotating
05:26 - the head so that's pretty much it for
05:27 - all the visuals then for adding some
05:30 - basic logic adding shooting to the
05:32 - players for identifying the shots it's
05:34 - actually pretty easy just doing a
05:36 - raycast exam like i showed in the mouse
05:38 - position video i just made a layer mask
05:40 - to only hit the players and that's it i
05:43 - could then click anywhere on the map and
05:44 - identify if there's a player underneath
05:46 - for the damage once again i reused my
05:49 - super useful health system which i made
05:50 - on the very first video on this channel
05:52 - three years ago so just a few seconds
05:55 - and i had health implemented then the
05:57 - question is what happens when a player
05:58 - dies and the obvious answer is adding
06:01 - some really nice ragdolls maybe you
06:03 - don't know about it but unity actually
06:04 - has a really helpful ragdoll wizard i
06:07 - wonder how many people don't know about
06:09 - that i might do a quick video on it it's
06:11 - really super simple to use you just open
06:13 - up the ragdoll wizard window then you
06:16 - just drag and drop all the various body
06:18 - parts make sure you select them
06:19 - correctly and then just click a button
06:21 - unity automatically adds all the rigid
06:23 - bodies and collaterals along with the
06:25 - joints so it's super simple and with
06:27 - default it already works pretty well and
06:29 - just with that i had some really nice
06:31 - rag dolls falling down then just need to
06:33 - apply that to shooting the players so
06:35 - when the player dies it just
06:37 - instantiates the ragdoll object on the
06:38 - exact same position
06:40 - just do that and yep when the player
06:41 - dies it instantly gets replaced by the
06:43 - ragdoll and falls down
06:45 - then of course falling down directly
06:46 - isn't much fun so i just added some
06:48 - simple explosion force to really push it
06:50 - around so with that the ragdolls weren't
06:52 - looking great for another tiny effect i
06:55 - just added some simple particles when
06:56 - shooting the four and some bullet
06:58 - particles when shooting the players all
07:00 - of them may be using the standard unt
07:01 - particle system
07:03 - for another small effect i also added
07:05 - some screen shake since i used syn
07:07 - machine this one was very easy to add
07:09 - just need to add the impulse listener on
07:11 - the virtual camera then add a impulse
07:14 - source component and manually generate
07:16 - the impulse when shooting that's pretty
07:18 - much it then for the highlight which is
07:20 - a pretty important thing pretty crucial
07:22 - to this game initially i was going to
07:24 - make it myself i've already done an
07:26 - outline shader quite a long time ago but
07:28 - that one is in 2d whereas here i'm
07:30 - working with 3d meshes so i need to find
07:32 - another method i started making it
07:34 - myself but then i remembered that a
07:36 - while ago i'm pretty sure i picked up a
07:38 - highlight asset in a previous as a store
07:40 - bundle so i just searched my assets and
07:42 - sure enough it was there just imported
07:44 - into my project and it worked perfectly
07:46 - so this is yet another example of how
07:48 - assets can really help you work better
07:50 - and faster you can always build it from
07:52 - scratch but sometimes you don't need to
07:54 - reinvent the wheel
07:55 - thanks to this asset i had my highlight
07:57 - effect fully working just a few minutes
08:00 - next up it was finally time to work on
08:01 - the ai
08:03 - the players need to run forward on the
08:04 - green light then on red light some need
08:07 - to be safe and some need to be caught i
08:09 - made a bunch of different behaviors so
08:12 - some of them they stop right on time and
08:13 - they are safe some of the players run
08:16 - back instantly on red light and try to
08:17 - escape kind of like what happened on the
08:19 - show on the first round
08:20 - then some other players would stop just
08:22 - a bit too late and they were caught but
08:24 - didn't run away
08:25 - however if they stay there forever it
08:27 - would be a bit too easy so i made them
08:29 - run away after some time so all that
08:31 - logic was pretty simple to add just a
08:33 - basic state machine one on the main
08:35 - manager script to handle the red light
08:37 - green light states and another one on
08:39 - the player script the handle running
08:41 - forward stopped or running back and for
08:43 - moving the players i also kept it
08:44 - extremely simple it really just moves
08:46 - the player forward and for rotating i
08:48 - use the quaternion lerp to rotate the
08:50 - players towards the target position and
08:52 - of course combine all of that with the
08:54 - previous highlights and gather some
08:55 - stats to see which players the guard
08:57 - caught how many were red and how many
08:59 - were green all in all just some very
09:01 - simple logic with those stats i then
09:03 - made a very simple ui just a little bar
09:05 - on top counting the number of players
09:07 - number of shots fired and accuracy
09:09 - as usual i made heavy use of c-sharp
09:11 - events in order to keep the code nice
09:13 - and clean and keep the ui completely
09:15 - decoupled from the logic scripts up next
09:18 - i added some more logic to the player's
09:20 - behavior i added a health system onto
09:22 - the door once again i reused that same
09:24 - health system that i made on the very
09:26 - first video on this channel three years
09:28 - ago
09:29 - made a simple health bar using a world
09:31 - space canvas and i also searched my
09:33 - assets to find a nice animation for
09:34 - attacking the door i found i had an
09:37 - asset pack with some crafting animations
09:39 - and one of them was hammering a wall so
09:40 - that one was perfect
09:42 - so with that the players attacked the
09:44 - wall and dealing damage then with some
09:45 - basic logic testing if the door was
09:47 - destroyed and if so let the players
09:49 - escape this is a great mechanic because
09:51 - it means that you as a guard don't have
09:53 - infinite time to slowly aim and shoot if
09:55 - you're not fast enough the players will
09:56 - destroy doors and simply escape at that
09:59 - point the main logic was mostly done
10:01 - just added in logic for winning so if
10:03 - the players reach the end they survive
10:05 - then i made a simple game over screen
10:07 - just showing the stats to see how many
10:09 - players survived how many escaped how
10:11 - many were caught in the guard's accuracy
10:13 - and for fun it made a simple score
10:15 - calculation after watching this video
10:17 - you can go play the game to see if you
10:18 - can beat my high score
10:20 - lastly i just need some sound effects
10:22 - the main thing is the song so i just
10:24 - grabbed that street from the show
10:26 - played around with the pitch in order to
10:27 - make it faster or slower and just a
10:29 - general shooting sound again just search
10:31 - my snl list for something i bought
10:33 - previously and with all that pretty much
10:35 - everything was done i made a webgl build
10:37 - so you can easily play to your browser
10:39 - and here's the final result
10:43 - [Music]
10:47 - foreign
11:04 - oh
11:24 - oh
11:43 - oh
12:08 - all right so that's how i turned squid
12:09 - game into an actual game but you play as
12:11 - the guard this was a really fun mini
12:14 - game to make there's already tons of
12:15 - games where you play as a player so i
12:17 - think this twist makes it pretty unique
12:19 - i use lots of systems to make this game
12:22 - lots of things that i covered in
12:23 - previous videos all of those are linked
12:25 - in the description so if there's
12:26 - something you want to learn some more
12:28 - about then go watch those videos
12:30 - now you can go ahead and go play it in
12:31 - your browser or download the pc version
12:33 - it runs a bit better so go ahead and see
12:35 - if you can beat my high score let me
12:37 - know in the comments how high you can go
12:39 - again if you're looking for a more
12:40 - guided path with step-by-step lectures
12:42 - then check out my complete courses
12:44 - alright hope that's useful check out
12:46 - these videos to learn some more thanks
