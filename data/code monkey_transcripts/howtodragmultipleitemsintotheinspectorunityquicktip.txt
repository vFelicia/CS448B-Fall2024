00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and this is a quick tip for dragging
00:03 - multiple items into the inspector
00:07 - so let's say you have a script like this
00:10 - one in here where you have a field for
00:12 - multiple values like an array the script
00:15 - takes an array of sprite renders and
00:16 - flips them so down here I have a bunch
00:20 - of goal nodes now if I try some like
00:22 - multiple of them as soon as I click on
00:24 - one you can see that the inspector
00:26 - changes and if I now select all of them
00:28 - I can no longer see the original
00:29 - reference in the first script so it
00:32 - would seem that I would need to select
00:34 - my original script so that I can see the
00:37 - array reference on my inspector and drag
00:39 - them one by one this works but it's
00:42 - obviously not the best way to do it
00:44 - so like that only if you were flipped
00:46 - but I want to flip them all so the trick
00:49 - in here is to first select the game
00:51 - object with the script that you want and
00:52 - now we can go up here and lock the
00:55 - inspector with the inspector unlocked
00:57 - you can see that it doesn't change when
00:59 - I select other things the inspector is
01:01 - still showing that even though I'm
01:02 - selecting different objects so now you
01:05 - can freely select multiple items so some
01:08 - like all of the goal nodes and now I can
01:10 - drag them all and drop them in the array
01:12 - and as you can see the array is
01:14 - instantly filmed with all of the
01:15 - selected objects so with all the
01:18 - references in here I can run the code
01:19 - and there you go all of them have been
01:21 - flipped this is very useful if you have
01:24 - for example a spreadsheet animation and
01:26 - want to drag a bunch of frames or like
01:28 - in this case you have a bunch of objects
01:30 - in your scene and want to drag all the
01:32 - references into an array so there you
01:35 - have it that's your quick tip for how to
01:36 - drag multiple items into the inspector
