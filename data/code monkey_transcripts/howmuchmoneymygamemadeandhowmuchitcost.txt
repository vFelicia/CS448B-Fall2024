00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your KMI so last
00:02 - month I launched my latest Team game
00:04 - it's called dinky Guardians it's a fun
00:06 - game with some automation Colony
00:08 - building in defense mechanics it has now
00:09 - been a month since the game has launched
00:11 - 7 months ago in March I published the
00:13 - announcement video where I talked about
00:14 - the game and what were my goals with it
00:16 - in order to analyze all of these goals
00:17 - and see if I hit them I'm going to share
00:19 - the sales numbers for this game I'm also
00:21 - going to go over what were all the costs
00:22 - involved in making this game so how much
00:25 - I spent on artists musicians translators
00:27 - and so on also of course what assets and
00:29 - tools that I use to make this game and
00:31 - then also in the end I will also talk
00:33 - about one very important cost that you
00:34 - should definitely consider as well as my
00:36 - general takeaway for this project the
00:38 - game is out on seam and it's actually on
00:40 - sale this week also put out a really
00:42 - nice update yesterday polishing tons of
00:44 - things and adding tons of quality of
00:45 - life improvements so go play it again or
00:47 - pick it up for the first time now right
00:49 - away the thing that most people want to
00:50 - know these sales numbers I won't click
00:52 - bait you and keep you waiting so if you
00:54 - want the numbers here they are right
00:55 - away these are the numbers for the first
00:57 - month now these are the raw numbers but
01:00 - by itself these numbers don't really say
01:01 - much they don't really say if the game
01:03 - is a hit or if it's a flop so let's
01:05 - analyze these numbers to see if they are
01:06 - good or bad and one great thing about
01:08 - having this channel is simply for
01:09 - documenting my own journey I made a
01:11 - video sharing my goals for this game
01:13 - right when I announced it so let's hear
01:14 - what I said in the video 7 months ago
01:16 - with all the math done here are all of
01:18 - the main goals launch a game in July of
01:20 - 23 launch with 10,000 wish lists have
01:23 - those wish list convert into 1,000 week
01:25 - one copy sold and 3,000 year one copy
01:28 - sold do that in order to hit $20,000 in
01:30 - gross revenue and $8,000 in net revenue
01:33 - which would equal around $2,000 per
01:35 - month development which would be a
01:37 - decent amount now let's split this into
01:39 - three scenarios so this one is the good
01:41 - scenario half of these amounts would be
01:43 - the bare minimum scenario and double
01:44 - would be the great scenario these are my
01:46 - goals with this game so yep these are
01:49 - the goals that I defined now some of
01:51 - these I hit and some I didn't the first
01:53 - obvious one is right away the release
01:54 - date the original plan was in July of 23
01:57 - which I obviously missed by quite a bit
01:59 - now now this is also one of those
02:00 - scenarios where honestly I have no idea
02:02 - what I was thinking even in the original
02:04 - scope of the game which was quite a bit
02:05 - more limited than the final version even
02:07 - that would have been really tricky to
02:08 - get done in this short time frame I'm
02:10 - pretty efficient but 4 months to make a
02:12 - complete steam game that is quite an
02:14 - insane amount quite fast so I guess this
02:16 - is a good takeaway for all of you if you
02:18 - make overly ambitious plans that
02:19 - eventually blow up on your face then
02:21 - don't be too harsh on yourself as you
02:23 - can see even with my 10 years of
02:25 - experience making games I still get it
02:26 - wrong by quite a bit making games is
02:28 - always extremely difficult G so it will
02:30 - always take you quite a bit longer in
02:32 - the end I started working on this game
02:33 - all the way back in March I actually
02:35 - made the original prototype on the plane
02:37 - flying over to GDC and now I've released
02:39 - the game in October so in total 7 months
02:41 - of development but more importantly
02:43 - looking at these goals my main goal for
02:45 - this year in general was to publish
02:46 - another game so even though I got the
02:49 - date wrong I definitely did not launch
02:51 - it by July I still managed to hit my
02:53 - important annual go so I definitely
02:54 - consider this success but because I got
02:56 - the development time wrong I need to
02:58 - basically adapt these numbers to get
02:59 - them more accurate picture my definition
03:01 - of success is still pretty much 2,000
03:03 - per month over here in Portugal I can
03:05 - live a pretty good life with this amount
03:06 - that's above the national average so
03:08 - with 7 months of Dev time the net
03:10 - revenue over here this one should be 14
03:12 - and the gross revenue this one should be
03:14 - 35k now in terms of number of copy sold
03:17 - these numbers are actually still correct
03:18 - that is because under the original plan
03:20 - I was going to price the game at $7 but
03:22 - in the end I end up going with 15 so y
03:24 - these amounts 1,000 and 3,000 these are
03:26 - correct and looking at these yep I did
03:28 - manage to hit 1,000 copy sold on the
03:30 - first week which based on my estimate
03:32 - should inde translate to about 3 to
03:33 - 5,000 in the first year so that's
03:35 - correct and based on that I estimated
03:37 - that it should be able to hit 50,000 in
03:38 - gross revenue which should indeed lead
03:40 - to more than 14,000 in net revenue which
03:42 - should indeed make for a Target monthly
03:44 - goal above 2,000 so yep in the end it
03:46 - should end up hitting all of my revised
03:48 - targets even though the timeline was off
03:50 - by quite a bit even with that it looks
03:52 - like everything is on track to be a
03:53 - pretty nice success the only thing I
03:55 - definitely did not hit was over here the
03:57 - wish list the game launched with 43 00
03:59 - wish list so quite a bit less than my
04:01 - minimum Target of 5K but the goal of
04:03 - wish list is of course to turn into
04:05 - sales so if I hit the sales Target then
04:06 - I'm still happy with my wishless amount
04:08 - so looking at this original plan I would
04:10 - say things have gone quite well the game
04:12 - is certainly not a mega hit by any means
04:14 - but it is going to hit my very nice good
04:15 - goal however these goals these sales
04:18 - numbers this is really just the revenue
04:20 - part it is obviously very important to
04:21 - also remember that everything has costs
04:24 - in fact in my case the cost is probably
04:25 - the most important part the main reason
04:27 - why I've been making a living from my
04:29 - games for over 10 years now the main
04:30 - reason is really because my costs are so
04:32 - low I've never had a mega hit I'm simply
04:34 - extremely productive extremely efficient
04:36 - and I live in a low cost country so for
04:38 - cting cost the m one is obviously time
04:41 - like I said took me 7 months to build
04:42 - this game my expenses are about 1,000
04:45 - to, 1500 per month so if we do, 1500 * 7
04:48 - that equals
04:53 - 10k.in logo you might have noticed that
04:55 - the game actually has had two logos the
04:58 - first one look quite a bit bit more
04:59 - casual but as the development progressed
05:02 - I leaned quite a bit more into the
05:03 - automation mechanics so by the end I
05:05 - felt it need like a bit more of an
05:06 - automation type logo so I got a second
05:09 - logo just before the final game release
05:11 - the cost for both logos was 50 plus 100
05:14 - then I also hired the musician to
05:15 - compose some original music actually
05:18 - hired the same one that did the music
05:19 - for kitchen chaos I was really happy
05:22 - with the result for that one so I
05:23 - contacted the same person for this one I
05:25 - got three really nice custom tracks for
05:27 - 360 bucks then another thing that I paid
05:30 - for was localization like I mentioned
05:32 - the video talking about how the seam
05:34 - algorithm Works localization is
05:35 - extremely important and using today's
05:37 - tools actually pretty simple to
05:39 - implement so it is definitely something
05:40 - you should add I made sure to localize
05:42 - both the game as well as the store Page
05:44 - I localized it in English plus seven
05:46 - other languages I hired a translator for
05:49 - each of those languages for a total of
05:50 - 740 bucks then the reason why this was
05:53 - my first 3D game was because I finally
05:55 - learned how to use assets the reason why
05:57 - my previous games those were all made in
05:58 - 2D that was was simply because I could
06:00 - not model any 3D things at all but
06:03 - nowadays I know how to use assets to
06:04 - help me find the visuals that I need
06:07 - however at the same time tracking the
06:08 - cost for this actually quite a bit
06:09 - tricky that's because I really don't
06:11 - remember how much I paid for them I
06:13 - probably bought most of the assets on
06:15 - sale either a 50% sale like the ones
06:17 - that are constantly happening on the
06:18 - asset store or some of them I probably
06:21 - bought in a hum bundle for like 95% off
06:24 - and some of them I was given for free
06:26 - and on top of that of course assets are
06:27 - not really just a onetime thing I've
06:29 - used a bunch of these Assets in plenty
06:31 - of projects and I will continue using
06:33 - them in many projects in the future so
06:35 - that makes it quite a bit tricky to Cate
06:37 - a accurate cost for all the assets that
06:39 - I used to make the game but still here
06:40 - is a list of all the nice assets that I
06:42 - used I got a nice pack for all my
06:44 - characters with all the customization
06:46 - for the zomies and the dinkies then for
06:48 - the cartoony visual I got a nice Shader
06:51 - for helping me polish things I use feel
06:53 - for animating the text I use text
06:55 - animator then for finding assets in all
06:58 - the tons of packs that already own known
06:59 - for that I use the ENT inventory super
07:01 - useful for building it in terms of
07:03 - visuals the main things that I used was
07:04 - the polygon sci-fi Worlds speack the
07:06 - particle effects the Sci-Fi space and
07:08 - the icons back I've always been a fan of
07:11 - the cinti studio style and finally I got
07:12 - a chance to use it in a proper game then
07:15 - for the animations I've used this pack
07:16 - which I've used in tons and tons of
07:17 - videos this one has been one of the most
07:19 - useful things that I've ever bought for
07:21 - tweaking some animations I use umotion
07:23 - Pro for the UI I grab this UI pack for a
07:26 - really nice screen space effect I grab
07:28 - this one it add some really nice shadow
07:30 - and all the nooks and crannies it looks
07:32 - really good for the construction effects
07:34 - I use the disolve effects and of course
07:36 - while working multiplayer like I covered
07:38 - in my free multiplayer course for that
07:40 - one it really helps to be able to have a
07:41 - console that you can access in easy ways
07:44 - and for that I use the quantum console
07:45 - just like I used previously so these are
07:47 - pretty much all the assets although I
07:49 - did pick some things some sound effects
07:50 - from other random packs but I'm not sure
07:53 - exactly which one so I didn't include it
07:54 - here either way if I add up all the math
07:56 - on all of these if I add up the math on
07:58 - all of the undiscounted price for all of
08:00 - these if I add all of those then the
08:02 - total price is supposedly $1,300 but in
08:05 - reality like I said I bought most of
08:06 - these either half off or in a Humble
08:08 - Bundle for like 95% off and like I said
08:10 - these assets are usable in multiple
08:12 - projects so for the math let's use half
08:14 - of this amount so let's say 600 bucks
08:16 - then the other cost that I had was
08:18 - actually an experiment basically I tried
08:20 - out paid advertising now this is
08:22 - something that usually the general
08:23 - consisten is don't do it paid ads are
08:26 - nearly impossible to get a return unless
08:28 - you have a Prett expensive game game so
08:30 - this really only usable for AAA and
08:32 - triaa Indie but in my case my experiment
08:35 - the strategy that I went for wasn't
08:36 - necessarily try to get sales but rather
08:38 - try to get wish list before release and
08:39 - the extremely important part about my
08:41 - strategy was that I pretty much put it
08:43 - on the lowest cost possible and just let
08:44 - them run for several months so basally
08:47 - the ads only ran when nothing else was
08:48 - available that way I paid as little as
08:50 - possible while trying to reach as many
08:52 - people as possible I used Google ads and
08:54 - here as you can see I spent a total of
08:56 - 1.4k that got me 13,000 clicks for an
08:59 - average cost per click of 11 cents and
09:01 - then I also tried out Rd ads and over
09:04 - here I also spent pretty much the same
09:05 - amount so 1.4k got a total of 19,000
09:08 - clicks for a total of 7 cents per click
09:10 - so the total cost on these ads was about
09:12 - 2.6 now sadly steam doesn't really have
09:15 - any tracking tools for this kind of
09:16 - stuff for tracking where the wish list
09:18 - came from so honestly I really have no
09:20 - idea if this experiment was a success or
09:22 - not I have no idea if this was great or
09:24 - if it was a complete waste of money no
09:27 - idea how many wish lists and sales it
09:28 - eventually generated if any although I
09:31 - already knew that which is why I went
09:32 - into this experiment with very low
09:34 - expectations that is why I didn't really
09:36 - spend too much and considering how the
09:38 - cost is so low and reached so many
09:39 - people I have to assume it had at least
09:41 - some kind of impact but again I really
09:44 - have no idea to verify it so putting
09:45 - everything together the total cost to
09:47 - develop this game the total direct cost
09:49 - was about
09:50 - €4,000 plus it costed my own time about
09:53 - 10,000 put all that together makes for a
09:55 - total cost of about 14k now if I put all
09:57 - these costs against the revenue
09:59 - after 1 month with gross revenue of
10:01 - 19,000 which equals 13.7 th000 in gross
10:05 - revenue then of course steam takes their
10:07 - 30% cut so the total amount that I'm
10:09 - actually going to receive is about 9.6
10:12 - If I subtract the cost then technically
10:14 - right now I'm actually in the red by
10:15 - about 5,000 but if I manage to hit my
10:17 - estimate for the first year if so then
10:19 - the game might actually end up turning a
10:21 - profit out of about 5,000 so again I'm
10:23 - pretty happy with this result however
10:25 - there's actually another a potentially
10:26 - huge cost that we probably should
10:28 - calculate although I should say this one
10:30 - is more kind of like for fun it's a
10:32 - theoretical cost but still one you
10:33 - should include in your cations what I'm
10:35 - talking about is the opportunity cost
10:37 - meaning what else could I have done with
10:39 - my time other than making this game
10:41 - usually the topic of opportunity cost
10:43 - usually that comes when deciding to do
10:45 - something for money rather than for fun
10:47 - like for example if you want to make
10:48 - games you might join a AAA developer and
10:50 - make something like 70k but if you got a
10:52 - job outside the games industry if you
10:54 - got something like Google or Facebook
10:55 - you could probably get around 200k so
10:58 - that's the opportunity cost you could
11:00 - have made 200k but you chose to make 70k
11:02 - technically that would be a negative
11:04 - cost of 70k but there are definitely
11:06 - things more valuable than money that is
11:08 - why I say that this cost is really
11:10 - mostly for fun just because you make way
11:12 - less money in Game Dev that does not
11:13 - mean it is the wrong choice so for
11:15 - example in my case if I compare to a
11:17 - regular job that I could get here in
11:19 - Portugal I've never had a real job so I
11:21 - have no personal experience but I did
11:23 - some research and apparently software
11:25 - devs here get about 1,000 per month
11:27 - compared to that my go monthly amount is
11:29 - already above it so objectively speaking
11:31 - for me making a game is more profitable
11:32 - than anything else I could do over here
11:34 - but of course I also have the option of
11:36 - all the other things that I could have
11:37 - done instead of a game for example I
11:39 - could have done nothing but YouTube for
11:41 - all this time although that would also
11:42 - not compare very well to making a game
11:44 - YouTube ads actually pay pretty badly
11:46 - especially in the Game Dev Niche there's
11:47 - not much money to go around on this
11:49 - channel if I get about a million views
11:51 - per month that equ will see a bit under
11:53 - $2,000 if I was doing nothing but
11:55 - YouTube I think the channel would grow a
11:57 - bit but definitely not something like
11:58 - 10x so comparing making a game with just
12:00 - full-time YouTube making a game is still
12:02 - the better option in my case the better
12:04 - comparison simply comes from Paid
12:06 - courses considering how much time I
12:07 - spent working on this game for seven
12:09 - months not stop I think in that time if
12:11 - I was focused on making course I could
12:12 - have made two maybe three courses and
12:14 - from experience I think those course
12:15 - could make about 40K each so in total by
12:18 - making course I could have maybe made
12:19 - something like 120k that does compare
12:22 - quite higher relative to making a game
12:24 - so in theory if my goal was to make
12:26 - money and nothing else if so then the
12:28 - best option would have definitely been
12:29 - make some paid courses and just do that
12:31 - but again like I said money is just one
12:33 - aspect that's why I say that cating this
12:35 - is really mainly for fun I intentionally
12:38 - wanted to make a game that was my main
12:40 - goal for this year the secondary goal
12:41 - was simply to make it profitable and
12:43 - looking at the numbers I did achieve
12:45 - that goal so as long as I can achieve my
12:47 - goals of keep making games and keep
12:48 - making a living then honestly personally
12:50 - I'm pretty happy I definitely don't feel
12:52 - the need to maximize profit at all cost
12:54 - if I can make a living doing what I want
12:56 - to do then I'm very happy and if you
12:58 - yourself decide to take a pay cut in
12:59 - order to work on games that may very
13:01 - well be worth it it all depends on what
13:03 - you want and what kind of life you want
13:04 - to live but like I said cting the
13:06 - opportunity cost this is really just for
13:07 - fun the real numbers are these ones how
13:09 - much money the game made and how much it
13:11 - cost and of course the game is more than
13:13 - just numbers all in all personally I'm
13:15 - really happy with this project my main
13:17 - goal was publishing another game this
13:19 - year and I did that so I'm very happy
13:20 - with having achieved my main goal as the
13:22 - year is coming to a close I really hope
13:24 - you also achieve your goals for this
13:25 - year now this is actually the part where
13:27 - I wanted to do a postmart and talk about
13:29 - what went right and what went wrong with
13:30 - the making of this game but I still need
13:33 - to write and record that part of the
13:34 - video so this one is really just focused
13:36 - on the hard numbers and the future one I
13:37 - will talk about what went right and what
13:39 - went wrong with this project but in
13:41 - general yep I'm happy with the numbers
13:42 - and how the game came out I really hope
13:44 - you've enjoyed following this journey
13:45 - over these past months starting with the
13:47 - first announcement all the way back in
13:49 - March until now the first month's
13:50 - results I really hope that this inspires
13:52 - you and gives you motivation on your own
13:54 - game d Journey all right so check out
13:56 - the game on seam if you haven't already
13:57 - thank you for watching and see you next
13:59 - time
