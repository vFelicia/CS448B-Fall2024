00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your KMI I saw
00:02 - this post on Reddit and I felt really
00:03 - important to make this video to clarify
00:05 - something that is indeed extremely
00:06 - important so the post is our horror game
00:08 - went somewhat viral but it was
00:10 - disappointing so what went wrong now
00:12 - this is a sad result when some kind of
00:13 - game doesn't get enough sales it's a sad
00:15 - result but suddenly it is not uncommon
00:17 - basically they released a horror game
00:19 - onto Early Access based on a local radio
00:21 - show from Indonesia and apparently the
00:23 - game went prev viral it reached number
00:25 - seven on trending in the gaming carard
00:27 - on YouTube that's definitely super high
00:29 - that's definitely very impressive
00:30 - countless Youtubers with millions of
00:32 - subscribers played our game and the
00:33 - feedback was mostly positive however the
00:35 - result an underwhelming number of wish
00:37 - lists and sales despite good publicity
00:39 - this is really the part that stood out
00:40 - to me right away and why I had to make
00:42 - this video despite right here
00:43 - underwhelming number of wish lists
00:45 - specifically this person is talking
00:46 - about wish lists after release looking
00:48 - at the game over here on cdb we can
00:50 - scroll down and we can see that just
00:52 - before release they had only 19
00:53 - followers so we can guesstimate roughly
00:55 - around 220 wish lists one of the
00:57 - comments asked what kind of marketing
00:59 - did you do for your game and developer
01:00 - answered that they basically didn't
01:02 - really do anything just did some local
01:03 - things with a local radio station the
01:05 - steam page really on launched a few
01:07 - weeks prior to release so apparently
01:08 - their plan was to quickly launch the
01:10 - game and then after launch get a bunch
01:12 - of wish list and get a bunch of sales to
01:14 - then hopefully have a successful 1.0
01:16 - release now here I want to warn you to
01:18 - not do this because this does not work
01:20 - wish list matter a lot I made a video
01:22 - talking about how the same algorithm
01:23 - works and that video is based on an act
01:25 - video posted by steam themselves the
01:27 - basic idea is wish list matter a lot
01:28 - before release the goal is to build up a
01:31 - massive wish list amount so that when
01:32 - the game finally releases all those wish
01:34 - lists get an email and hopefully buy
01:35 - your game then hopefully those that do
01:37 - buy the game they enjoy it which leads
01:38 - to more visibility on seam and starts
01:40 - the ball rolling that is really the main
01:42 - purpose behind wish list but after the
01:43 - game is out after release wish lists
01:45 - don't really matter much the game did
01:47 - get millions of views in coverage we can
01:49 - look for it and see yep here's one video
01:50 - getting 2 million views that's an insane
01:52 - amount and it's a 57 minute videos so
01:54 - it's really detailed then there's a
01:56 - bunch more 300K views another one with
01:58 - 1.2 million almost 1 million so this
02:01 - game did get a ton of coverage but again
02:03 - importantly all of that coverage all of
02:05 - that came after release so this one on
02:06 - November 28th and November 28th that was
02:09 - way after the game actually released so
02:11 - we can see over here a bump so a bunch
02:13 - of people did see it thanks to those
02:14 - videos so it appears that here maybe it
02:16 - gained about a th000 wish lists and if
02:18 - this was before release this would be
02:19 - quite useful but after release these
02:21 - amount of wish listes don't really
02:23 - matter too much so my goal in this video
02:24 - is simply to tell you that wish list
02:26 - matter a ton but they matter before
02:27 - release after release don't worry about
02:29 - wish list after release really the only
02:31 - thing that matters are just sales and
02:32 - this is actually also a really
02:33 - interesting case study on the power of
02:35 - influencers or rather how sometimes they
02:37 - have a lot of power and sometimes not so
02:39 - much getting covered by influencers is
02:41 - not an automatic win it depends a lot on
02:43 - what influencer it is and perhaps more
02:45 - importantly on what gen it is then
02:47 - another topic is the game is actually
02:48 - launched into Early Access which by
02:50 - itself Early Access for horror games
02:52 - that is usually not a very good option
02:54 - Early Access is really more meant for
02:55 - systems based games whereas things like
02:57 - horror which I'm guessing is more of a
02:59 - story focused game for these kinds of
03:00 - games Early Access usually doesn't help
03:02 - too much but perhaps more broadly over
03:04 - here we can see approximately how long
03:06 - will this game be in early access and
03:08 - the goal is to be just approximately 3
03:10 - months so on this I also want to caution
03:12 - you not to do this if you do go into
03:14 - Early Access First of all have a game
03:15 - that works with Early Access but then
03:17 - secondly make sure you go into Early
03:19 - Access if you have a plan for it for at
03:20 - least one year Early Access is really
03:22 - tricky it's really difficult to get
03:23 - right if you want to see some tips for
03:25 - it there's some really great articles
03:27 - over here on the H Market game blog
03:29 - there's on should you do Early Access
03:31 - another one all about the launch numbers
03:33 - but in general Early Access is not a
03:35 - quick thing so if you are just 3 months
03:36 - away from the final release I would say
03:38 - only launch your game onto 1.0 straight
03:40 - away because basically by doing it into
03:42 - Early Access by doing this you're
03:44 - actually going to sell quite a lot less
03:45 - during early access and the only way
03:47 - that the 1.0 will work well is if the
03:49 - 1.0 is dressy different from the Early
03:51 - Access so that is why I say pretty much
03:53 - only going to Early Access if you have
03:54 - at least one year of development ahead
03:56 - of you and yet another thing related
03:58 - specifically to Early Access on the
03:59 - original post Dev says from this lesson
04:01 - we're trying to revamp the game at the
04:02 - moment for the phone release doing an
04:04 - overhaul of the scenarios mechanics
04:05 - visuals and everything hopefully we can
04:07 - do better this time around and on this
04:09 - one I would say suddenly this is
04:11 - probably not going to work out very well
04:12 - usually if your game flops during Early
04:14 - Access if so then it's really difficult
04:16 - to get back on some kind of 1.0 release
04:18 - usually for the most part you only have
04:20 - one launch that is either your normal
04:22 - launch or your Early Access launch and
04:24 - if that one fumbles like this one sort
04:25 - of did if so then it is highly highly
04:27 - likely you get massive exposure on the
04:29 - 1.0 release chances are that when this
04:31 - game comes out of Early Access when it
04:33 - does a 1.0 when that happens it will
04:35 - probably sell maybe 10% more copies but
04:37 - certainly not 10 times more if you do
04:39 - decide to do Early Access keep in mind
04:40 - that it is highrisk high reward the
04:42 - games that do find success they find
04:44 - massive success but those are extremely
04:46 - rare most of the games if they flop
04:47 - during the Early Access release if they
04:49 - do so they will also flop during the 1.0
04:51 - release so sadly statistically speaking
04:53 - it is highly likely that this game will
04:55 - turn around for the 1.0 release but I
04:58 - hope I'm wrong I hope this Dev manag
04:59 - just to turn it around and I hope that
05:01 - by watching this video you now know what
05:03 - not to do mainly remember how wish lists
05:05 - really only matter before release
05:06 - there's an excellent hble Bund right now
05:08 - with a M neset all for just 25 bucks if
05:11 - you don't yet have a mega pack like this
05:13 - one then I highly recommend you pick
05:14 - this up anytime you have an idea for a
05:16 - game it is really useful to have a bunch
05:18 - of assets you can easily pick up and use
05:20 - with all these assets you can make tons
05:22 - of really interesting games and if you
05:23 - want to stay up to date with the latest
