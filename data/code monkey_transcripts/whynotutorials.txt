00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - now recently someone asked me when is
00:04 - the next tutorial or perhaps a slightly
00:06 - different question why Sophie tutorials
00:08 - lately I started this channel five years
00:09 - ago pretty much just doing nothing but
00:11 - tutorials whereas in the past few weeks
00:13 - I've definitely not done that many I've
00:15 - been mainly doing just some more general
00:16 - tonking advice videos so here let me
00:19 - explain why that is how I organize my
00:21 - work how I plan things what I'm
00:22 - currently prioritizing and what types of
00:24 - videos you can expect from me in the
00:26 - future now like I said in my request
00:27 - this comment the answer is actually very
00:29 - simple lately I've been working hard on
00:31 - my game so I really haven't had much
00:32 - time to make tutorials especially since
00:34 - those videos usually take dozens of
00:36 - hours to make honestly I have to say I
00:38 - have greatly underestimated the amount
00:40 - of time and effort that it would take to
00:42 - make a game and keep the channel running
00:43 - at the same time back in March I
00:45 - generally thought that I could work on
00:47 - this game and keep making videos while
00:49 - also working on some complex tutorials
00:50 - and even make some courses in the
00:52 - meantime looking back it seems so
00:54 - obvious that that is just way too much
00:56 - work and not really possible but back
00:57 - then I generally believe that I could do
00:59 - that this year I did start to work with
01:01 - some editors but I still do about 80 to
01:03 - 90 of the work so for the most part
01:05 - behind this channel the videos the games
01:06 - of course the everything really most of
01:08 - it is still just me so looking back I
01:11 - was definitely quite crazy to think that
01:12 - I could do all of this at the same time
01:13 - I guess this is a nice teaching moment
01:15 - even though I'm already quite
01:17 - experienced I've been making games for
01:18 - decades even with all that experience I
01:20 - still grossly underestimate how long
01:22 - something takes so if you yourself go
01:25 - over your own estimates then don't be
01:26 - too hard on yourself estimating how much
01:29 - effort and time something takes is an
01:30 - extremely difficult skill and one that
01:32 - is very difficult to get as you can see
01:33 - I still don't have it but anyways yes so
01:36 - like I said here my answer is simply I
01:38 - can't do everything I need to prioritize
01:40 - what videos I work on and right now I'm
01:42 - enjoying working on the game and I
01:44 - really think this has the potential to
01:45 - do quite well so I'm very excited to
01:46 - work on the game in order for the game
01:48 - to find success I'm working both harder
01:50 - on the game to make the game actually
01:51 - great but I'm also trying to gather as
01:53 - many wishlists as possible to ensure a
01:55 - successful launch the game is currently
01:57 - on 3000 wishlist which is a pretty
01:59 - decent amount my hope is to be able to
02:00 - hit something like 5000 by release date
02:02 - which right now the only state is
02:04 - tentatively set for October 2nd so just
02:07 - a bit over a month to get there with
02:08 - that in mind when it comes to choosing
02:10 - what videos to make I am prioritizing
02:12 - things that might get more views and
02:13 - importantly videos where I can also
02:15 - mention my game in a way that makes
02:16 - sense the reality is that tutorials I
02:18 - really enjoy making them I really enjoy
02:20 - researching something and teaching it
02:21 - but whilst I do enjoy making them they
02:23 - are simultaneously some of the most time
02:25 - consuming videos to make while also
02:26 - being the ones I get for your views and
02:28 - that's fine I'm okay with that but it
02:30 - does make it tricky to justify making it
02:32 - in times like these where I have a very
02:34 - very limited amount of time time a
02:35 - tutorial can take anywhere from 10 to
02:37 - 100 hours to make depending on
02:38 - complexity for example something like
02:40 - how to control send machine through code
02:42 - that video was pretty simple so that
02:44 - might have taken just about 10 hours
02:45 - whereas for example the tutorial on how
02:48 - to use Azure to make five really
02:49 - interesting game mechanics that one was
02:51 - really interesting I definitely loved
02:53 - all the research and learning all about
02:54 - the cloud and how to work with it in
02:56 - total I probably spent over a hundred
02:58 - hours just researching that to make that
03:00 - video but for those 100 hours of work as
03:02 - you can see the end result is just 15K
03:04 - views which again like I said I'm
03:06 - perfectly okay with that I've been doing
03:07 - this for long enough that I do know that
03:09 - tutorials will not do as well as
03:10 - different formats and I'm okay with that
03:12 - absolutely do not regret those 100 hours
03:14 - that I spent researching and making this
03:15 - video personally I really enjoyed
03:17 - researching a brand new area the video
03:19 - has gotten just four views in the last
03:20 - 48 hours and I really hope those four
03:22 - people will learn a lot from this video
03:24 - but on the other hand in more tonking
03:26 - video something like this one all about
03:27 - when to punish your game making this
03:29 - video too soon like 10 hours so much
03:31 - much less in the other tutorial and the
03:33 - more important part is what I mentioned
03:34 - about ago which is one of the reasons
03:36 - why I made this video was because I was
03:37 - going through this polish process in my
03:39 - own game which again allowed me to
03:41 - mention the game in the video and
03:42 - hopefully some of these people that
03:43 - watch it some of them out of the game to
03:45 - their wishlist that's pretty much my
03:47 - priority right now do more General
03:48 - videos that don't take as much time so I
03:50 - can keep working on the game and choose
03:52 - video topics where I can somehow include
03:54 - a mention of my game to hopefully gather
03:55 - wish lists so that hopefully the final
03:57 - release in October that one finds
03:59 - success like I said I started this
04:00 - channel over five years ago mainly with
04:02 - just tutorials what I've been going with
04:04 - sharing the knowledge that I had gained
04:05 - from making all of my games and I very
04:07 - much still want to keep doing that I
04:09 - love researching things and making
04:10 - videos explaining what I learned I'm
04:12 - constantly getting ideas for things that
04:13 - I'd love to cover for example just last
04:15 - month I was playing Desperados 3 and I
04:17 - thought it would be really fun to make a
04:19 - really detailed video on something like
04:20 - a stealth enemy AI I also thought about
04:23 - making a gold currency system that many
04:25 - games use I'd like to make a simple
04:27 - online chat I'd like to make a simple
04:28 - video on netcode for game of season 2D
04:30 - maybe a video on how to control time
04:32 - something on covering multi-threading
04:34 - basics so you can see I have certainly
04:36 - no issue with lack of ideas for its
04:38 - General topics eventually with enough
04:40 - time I do hope to get through all of
04:41 - these and of course I've been a huge fan
04:43 - of Dodd since it was first announced for
04:45 - the past few years I've only started
04:46 - myself okay so I'm basically just
04:48 - waiting for version 1.0 and when that
04:50 - comes out I want to do tons of tutorials
04:51 - on dots but then 1.0 finally came out
04:54 - and it's exactly what I'm in the middle
04:56 - of all this work so I have done some
04:58 - research on the 1.0 version but I
05:00 - haven't yet managed to do a video on
05:02 - that and I also do want to keep
05:03 - experimenting with these more General
05:05 - tonking opinion videos I think these can
05:07 - also be extremely useful in a
05:09 - non-technical way since there's so much
05:10 - about game development that is not
05:12 - necessarily technical so these are
05:13 - definitely topics that I'd love to talk
05:15 - some more about in the end I do want to
05:17 - keep making tutorials and general toning
05:19 - videos while also making complete
05:20 - courses and my own games but there's
05:22 - really just no time to do all that at
05:24 - exactly the same time and somewhat
05:26 - related I'm also currently training to
05:27 - hopefully run my first marathon so that
05:29 - also means a bit less time to work on
05:31 - projects I really wish I had a time
05:33 - machine so in general in the near future
05:34 - and until the game comes out in early
05:36 - October chances are there's not going to
05:38 - be too many tutorials there won't be
05:40 - some especially if I can find some way
05:41 - to relate them to the game but
05:43 - definitely not too many my main focus
05:45 - right now is really just working on the
05:46 - game and getting it finished by the
05:48 - deadline I'm also trying to do some Dev
05:49 - Vlogs and some general tonking videos
05:51 - where I can mention the game to
05:52 - hopefully gather some wish lists that's
05:54 - pretty much my current set of priorities
05:55 - then after the game is out in late
05:57 - October after that you can definitely
05:59 - expect new tutorials perhaps new
06:01 - complete courses and perhaps even free
06:03 - courses I've got a bunch of ideas that I
06:05 - love to try out like I said I've gotten
06:07 - lots of things on my mind lots of stuff
06:08 - that I'd love to create to hopefully
06:10 - help you on your own gamedev journey I
06:12 - really just need time to be able to do
06:14 - all of that alright so I hope this video
06:16 - helped clarify how I organize my
06:17 - schedule and what my plan is for the
06:19 - near future go ahead and add my empty
06:21 - your wishlist I wish you the best of
06:23 - luck with your own games thanks for
06:25 - watching and I'll see you next time
