00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and this is a pretty quick video just
00:03 - highlighting some changes with
00:05 - shadowgraph in unity 2020 and above over
00:08 - the last few years i've made a bunch of
00:10 - shaders using shadowgraph i've made some
00:12 - simple dissolve a really nice shield
00:14 - some wind effects and so on you can find
00:16 - the home playlist linked in the
00:17 - description and all those tutorials are
00:20 - still accurate and fully working in any
00:22 - unity version there's only just a few
00:24 - slight changes required to make it work
00:25 - on the latest unity version there's
00:27 - really only one main huge difference
00:29 - which i'm going to cover in the end if
00:31 - you prefer a more guided path with
00:33 - step-by-step lectures then check out my
00:35 - complete courses learn how to make a
00:37 - builder defender game using c-sharp just
00:39 - like i make my own steam games or learn
00:42 - how to make games internally using
00:43 - visual scripting or learn all about
00:45 - unity with the ultimate overview course
00:47 - which contains over 13 lectures each
00:49 - covering a different tool or feature of
00:51 - the engine to help you make better games
00:53 - faster i'm always available in the
00:54 - courses q a section answering your
00:56 - questions every single day so check out
00:58 - all the courses with the link in the
00:59 - description okay so here i have my
01:01 - project i'm using unity 2020.3 and i'm
01:04 - using shadowgraph version 10
01:06 - and if i just go and create a brand new
01:08 - graph and over here i see the new shadow
01:11 - graph window
01:12 - now there are two main changes
01:14 - first of all the properties over here on
01:16 - the left side now previously when you
01:18 - made a property so let's say a float
01:21 - call it amount
01:22 - previously when you made this you would
01:24 - see all the parameters right under here
01:26 - however now as of unity 2010 there is a
01:29 - dedicated graph inspector window so this
01:31 - shows all of the information for the
01:33 - selected property so here you still see
01:35 - the exact same thing so you see the name
01:37 - you see the reference the default value
01:39 - and so on so all the things that
01:40 - previously were around here they're now
01:42 - separate on the graph inspector and this
01:44 - one shows extra information on any
01:46 - selected properties and it also shows
01:48 - some extra information on any nodes if i
01:50 - select the node now i see the node
01:52 - settings
01:53 - so this is one of the main changes some
01:55 - of the property parameters are in a
01:56 - separate window as opposed to all being
01:58 - on the same place the other big changes
02:00 - with regards to the master node now
02:03 - previously the masternode look like any
02:05 - other node but on this version it's
02:07 - slightly different
02:08 - first of all it's not an actual node so
02:11 - previously you could just right click
02:13 - and add any new master nodes and define
02:15 - one of them as active whereas now you
02:17 - just have this single master stack which
02:19 - you cannot delete and you cannot add any
02:21 - more of them so if i just go here and i
02:23 - type in master nope doesn't find
02:25 - anything but again all of that
02:26 - functionality still exists except now
02:29 - it's on the graph inspector so over here
02:31 - on the graph inspector you've got this
02:32 - one for the node settings and next to it
02:34 - the graph settings one of the things
02:36 - that you would do by creating a new
02:37 - master node would be simply just change
02:39 - the type so previously you would make a
02:41 - new master node and set that one as
02:43 - active whereas now you've got this nice
02:45 - drop down menu so if i wanted to change
02:47 - this node from being lit to being sprite
02:49 - lit or unlit or anything i just have to
02:51 - select from down here and automatically
02:53 - updates the master node so there you go
02:55 - just like that and all the other
02:57 - settings that showed up on the gear icon
03:00 - they also now show up over here on the
03:01 - graph inspector so over here on the
03:03 - surface you can change it from opaque to
03:05 - transparent you can add an alpha clip
03:06 - make it to the side and so on now one
03:09 - great new addition in this new version
03:11 - is the fact that you can now build
03:12 - shaders that work for both urp and hdrp
03:16 - previously they were commonly separate
03:18 - so you need to make two different graphs
03:20 - whereas now you can just click on the
03:22 - plus icon and if you have multiple
03:24 - render pipelines installed and over here
03:26 - you can simply add them
03:27 - so you can make just one shader just one
03:30 - shadow graph file and make it work in
03:31 - universal agrp or also make it work with
03:34 - the vfx ref so this is super useful for
03:36 - ensuring all of your graphs work on all
03:38 - pipelines and reducing any asset
03:40 - duplication i imagine this is going to
03:42 - be super useful as we go along for any
03:44 - asset that gets placed on the asset
03:46 - store so going forward chances are most
03:48 - assets will support all of the rendered
03:50 - pipelines now there's still one more
03:52 - huge difference and this one is with
03:54 - regards to making some 2d shaders
03:56 - now over here i've got the the solve
03:58 - effect that i made in a previous video
04:01 - and this one is actually the actual file
04:03 - that i created in that video so this
04:05 - file this graph was created in unity
04:07 - 2019 however it still loads perfectly
04:10 - right in here when using shadowgraph 10.
04:12 - so interestingly enough even though
04:14 - shadowgraph has changed you can still
04:16 - directly load all of the old shadow
04:18 - graphs
04:19 - however note the master stack here
04:21 - look how the fragment has a sprite color
04:23 - with four colors
04:25 - whereas over here on the new shadow
04:26 - graph you can see that it looks quite
04:28 - different and the main difference is
04:30 - like i saw previously the caller had
04:31 - four valleys so it had rgb and a whereas
04:34 - on this one now you only got three so
04:36 - you only got rgb and you've got the
04:38 - alpha separate so let's see what
04:40 - difference this makes so if i just go
04:43 - into my own dissolve and i just copy all
04:45 - these notes
04:46 - and i paste them all in here
04:48 - in doing so now in the other one i
04:50 - simply connect that one into the base
04:51 - color and if i do that everything does
04:53 - work i do have the the song working but
04:56 - as you can see i do not have the alpha
04:57 - working so as you're following some
05:00 - older tutorials and yes you're
05:01 - recreating them from scratch keep this
05:03 - in mind the outfit channel is separate
05:05 - so in this case it's super simple to
05:07 - solve
05:08 - i've actually got the alpha channel
05:10 - right in here these got all four values
05:12 - so i can simply add the split node and i
05:14 - input this one and the split you can
05:16 - select each individual channel so for
05:18 - example i can just grab the alpha
05:20 - channel connected and yep now this one
05:21 - is perfect so this is the one big
05:24 - breaking change previously if you fed
05:26 - the alpha input directly into the base
05:28 - color it would automatically apply it
05:29 - whereas now you need to have a separate
05:31 - alpha for the separate alpha input
05:34 - so that's the main thing that you need
05:35 - to be careful with when following some
05:37 - tutorials with other graph versions
05:39 - alright so those are the changes as you
05:41 - can see they are pre-minor so if you
05:43 - find an old tutorial that was made
05:45 - months or even years ago you can still
05:47 - follow it and just apply these small
05:48 - changes for example go check out all of
05:50 - the effects that i made in the playlist
05:52 - and you can easily convert them to work
05:54 - in the latest version again if you're
05:56 - looking for a more guided path with
05:58 - step-by-step lectures then check out my
05:59 - complete courses alright hope that's
06:01 - useful check out these videos to learn
06:03 - some more thanks to these awesome
06:05 - patreon supporters for making these
06:06 - videos possible thank you for watching
06:08 - and i'll see you next time
