00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made with unity for february 2022
00:06 - this month was actually really difficult
00:08 - to pick just then i saw at least 20
00:10 - games that looked super interesting the
00:12 - indie game scene is truly amazingly
00:14 - varied regardless of what you're into
00:16 - there's tons of awesome games for just
00:18 - about everyone if you want to be a
00:20 - successful indie game developer you need
00:22 - to keep up to date with what's coming
00:23 - out i make these videos once a month so
00:25 - i can learn which games are finding
00:26 - success all of these games are initially
00:28 - impressive so the list is in no
00:30 - particular order except for the number
00:32 - one game that is my personal pick of the
00:33 - month also there's affiliate links in
00:35 - the description for some of the games by
00:37 - the way just a quick mention the senti
00:39 - humble bundle was excellent but ends in
00:40 - just one day if you haven't picked it up
00:42 - yet i would highly recommend you get it
00:44 - tons of super high quality assets that
00:46 - enable you to make hundreds of unique
00:48 - games all for an extremely cheap price
00:50 - there's less than 24 hours left so
00:51 - definitely get it now alright so
00:53 - starting off at number 10 with a really
00:55 - awesome one both awesome in terms of
00:57 - design as well as in tech here is
00:59 - diplomacy is not an option
01:01 - right away you can see the massive scale
01:03 - with battles feature thousands of units
01:06 - this one is a castle defense game
01:08 - and the reason why this one is awesome
01:09 - in terms of tech is because this might
01:11 - be the very first only release game
01:13 - using unity dots
01:15 - this is exactly the example of a game
01:17 - that would not be possible without dots
01:19 - this massive scale is truly insane
01:21 - and even though entities is still
01:23 - technically in development and there
01:24 - haven't been any public updates in over
01:26 - a year it's actually getting a massive
01:28 - update sometime soon but despite that
01:30 - all of the reviews are all very positive
01:32 - with over 1500 reviews so what that
01:35 - tells me is that even though the game is
01:36 - using some unproven potentially unstable
01:39 - technology it's apparently stable enough
01:41 - that the players are not encountering
01:43 - any weird bugs
01:44 - and of course the game itself also looks
01:46 - awesome personally i'm always a fan of
01:47 - massive battles and this game certainly
01:49 - provides them and up next we have tiny
01:51 - combat arena the description for the
01:54 - game starts off by calling it an
01:55 - approachable combat flight simulator
01:57 - game for me that's very important i'm a
01:59 - fan of planes and flying games but i'm
02:01 - not much of a fan for those hardcore
02:03 - simulations really i just want to fly a
02:05 - plane and have some fun which appears to
02:07 - be exactly what this game is about
02:09 - it also has a nice stylized look which
02:11 - helps make it look much less
02:13 - intimidating
02:14 - you can dock fight to other pilots or
02:16 - provide support to your units on the
02:17 - ground by dropping bombs on enemy tanks
02:20 - take part in a vast war with objectives
02:22 - and friendly armies to support then for
02:24 - something very colorful here is only
02:26 - only world it's a skateboard action
02:28 - platformer you can flip and flow through
02:31 - this vibrant world and meet colorful
02:33 - characters as you grind do some tricks
02:35 - and get some air this one is the third
02:37 - entry in this series and based on the
02:38 - review it continues to be excellent you
02:41 - can take things casually and just have
02:42 - some fun or you can compete against
02:44 - rivals with a hugely deep combo system
02:46 - with over a hundred move semester or
02:49 - maybe if that's too cheery for you and
02:50 - you want something quite a bit more
02:52 - darker here is blood west
02:54 - it's an immersive horror stealth fps
02:56 - game set in the wicked wild west it's
02:58 - got a really nice visual very much a ps1
03:01 - style with some low poly models and
03:03 - pixelated textures
03:04 - lots of twisted demons and eldritch
03:06 - warriors for you to fight and of course
03:08 - you've got a nice arsenal of all kinds
03:10 - of wild west weapons at your disposal
03:12 - the action is a mixture of slow and
03:14 - steady during stealth and then some
03:16 - massive intense action after you're
03:17 - discovered personally i really like how
03:19 - the weapons are huge and right in front
03:21 - of the camera it really enhances the
03:22 - intense feeling making you feel much
03:24 - more vulnerable by the way if you find
03:26 - the video helpful please hit the like
03:28 - button it's a tiny thing but really does
03:30 - help thanks then something very unique
03:32 - and also looks like quite a bit of fun
03:34 - here is modern builder it's a game all
03:36 - about building and customizing modern
03:38 - vehicles you slice open the box grab the
03:41 - parts and put them all together you can
03:43 - build tanks mechs cars planes and much
03:45 - more once they are built you can take
03:47 - your time and apply a nice coat of paint
03:49 - then you place your models on your shelf
03:51 - for all the world to admire certainly a
03:53 - very unique game but despite being what
03:55 - i would assume as somewhat niche it
03:57 - already has tons of very positive
03:58 - reviews so lots of people are really
04:00 - enjoying it up next if you're a fan of
04:02 - the cold then check out artico it's a
04:05 - nice exploration game with some crafting
04:07 - and building mechanics explore the
04:09 - arctic with your dark slide team use
04:11 - your kayak and your parachute gather
04:13 - some resources do some experiments and
04:15 - build up your base the game certainly
04:17 - has a zen-like quality so if you just
04:19 - want to build things in peace and don't
04:21 - want to fight any monsters then maybe
04:23 - give this one a go for some vr here is
04:25 - soul scade
04:27 - it's a dungeon crawler rpg
04:29 - use many spells weapons and even
04:31 - environment against your deadly foes
04:33 - dodge some fireballs by moving out of
04:35 - the way use melee weapons like you would
04:37 - expect but also do some magic by doing
04:40 - some gestures with your hands the enemy
04:42 - bosses look really powerful they've got
04:44 - some attacks that really look like they
04:46 - have some serious impact and it even has
04:48 - some chest mimics
04:50 - so i guess if you wanted something
04:51 - similar to dark souls but in vr form
04:53 - then this is it then for a game that
04:55 - kind of proves how a good title with a
04:57 - good concept is a great way to make your
04:59 - game much more marketable here is max v
05:01 - kaijus
05:02 - just based on the name i'm already very
05:04 - interested in you play as the commander
05:06 - of a mech army kaijus are attacking and
05:09 - it's up to you to defend
05:10 - equip and improve your mech place down
05:12 - some towers in factories right on the
05:14 - battlefield deploy support units and
05:16 - hold back the kaiju hoard
05:18 - then for something which just came out
05:20 - out of early access here is home behind
05:23 - i actually think i might have covered
05:24 - this one before in this series probably
05:26 - when it went into early access
05:28 - now it's finally fully out with over
05:30 - 5000 very positive reviews the game is a
05:33 - roguelike rpg you'll need your group of
05:36 - revolutionary fighters and try to
05:38 - overthrow the brutal authoritarian
05:40 - regime features side by side action very
05:42 - much like darkest dungeon although this
05:44 - one is in real time with a technical
05:46 - pause
05:47 - there's also some vehicle sections with
05:49 - some top-down combat so it's got a nice
05:51 - mix of mechanics you've got tons of
05:54 - weapons armor skills and lots of random
05:56 - events to test your skills and finally
05:58 - at number one for my personal pick of
05:59 - the month here is power to the people
06:02 - i've been interested in this one since i
06:04 - saw some random gif on twitter
06:06 - personally i love games about logistics
06:08 - especially when they focus on just one
06:10 - thing instead of having to build an
06:11 - entire city so with this one as you can
06:14 - tell by the very clever name this one is
06:16 - all about electricity
06:17 - the city starts off small with not much
06:19 - need in terms of power but cities grow
06:22 - so as it grows so does the energy needs
06:24 - it's up to you to build and keep
06:26 - building the electrical grid to stay up
06:28 - to date with the city's demands
06:30 - features lots of buildings to provide
06:32 - and transfer power so you can go with
06:34 - nuclear or maybe some renewables or
06:36 - maybe even try sticking with fossil
06:38 - fuels
06:39 - and of course the only challenge is not
06:40 - just the city growing there's also the
06:42 - threat of natural disasters that
06:44 - threaten to destroy your grid so build
06:46 - up your infrastructure make sure it
06:47 - works make sure it's enough and keep it
06:49 - running all right so that's 10 awesome
06:51 - new games made with unity and launched
