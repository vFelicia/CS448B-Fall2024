00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the asosaurus full of awesome tools and
00:04 - assets to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - October 22. in this first video I'll be
00:11 - covering a list of free assets and next
00:13 - ones I'll be covering paid ads and tools
00:15 - let me know in the comments if you pick
00:16 - up any of these and what you intend to
00:17 - do with them and by the way check out my
00:19 - own assets on the store so far I've made
00:21 - the free key door system which is a
00:23 - super simple way to add Keys indoors to
00:24 - your game the mouse cursor system Pro
00:26 - which is a really easy to use tool to
00:28 - help you create custom animated cursors
00:30 - to really make your game stand out and
00:32 - the free health system which easily lets
00:34 - you add help to any object in your games
00:36 - alright so on to the top 10 list
00:38 - starting off with an official Unity
00:40 - sample project all about the unity UI
00:42 - toolkit this is unity's UI solution that
00:45 - is quite different from ENT UI I've
00:47 - already done a bunch of research on this
00:48 - but I haven't had the time to make a
00:50 - phone tutorial yet it's a pretty
00:51 - interesting system allows you to have
00:53 - separation between structure logic and
00:55 - visuals and the best thing of all is how
00:57 - it's a tool that works for both runtime
00:59 - as well as their UI the Legacy Way of
01:02 - building editor windows and tools is
01:04 - really difficult it requires tons of
01:05 - confusing code to build something simple
01:07 - using UI toolkit makes that process much
01:10 - much easier so that's UA tokit and this
01:12 - is a brand new free sample showcasing UI
01:14 - toolkit and using it as runtime UI it
01:16 - looks great it's got lots of buttons
01:18 - sliders and animations so if you're
01:20 - interested in UI tokit definitely go
01:22 - ahead and inspect the code in this
01:23 - sample up next is yet another free
01:25 - official Unity tool this is a dots
01:28 - character controller this was actually
01:30 - made by a third party and it was just
01:32 - recently bought by unity and they made
01:34 - it free for everyone it's from the same
01:36 - developer that made the excellent
01:37 - kinematic character controller so it's
01:39 - very well built made by someone who
01:41 - really knows how to build character
01:42 - controllers this one as the name implies
01:44 - it's built on dots so when dots come out
01:46 - of 1.0 and people start using it more
01:48 - and more I can definitely see this one
01:50 - becoming super useful it supports just
01:52 - about anything that you would want from
01:54 - a character controller so you can walk
01:55 - around irregular surfaces walk around to
01:57 - rain walk on top of moving Vehicles
01:59 - change gravity walk on a circular plant
02:01 - and tons more being based on dots also
02:04 - means it's insanely performant and
02:05 - easily supports literally thousands of
02:07 - controllers so you can add this complex
02:09 - controller to all your enemies and PCs
02:11 - or anything in your game and it really
02:12 - won't cost much performance at all then
02:15 - if you're making a ccg here's a nice
02:17 - card kit demo features lots of pieces
02:19 - you can combine to get the cards looking
02:21 - exactly as you wanted the symbols can
02:23 - mean whatever you want so maybe they
02:24 - mean an attack maybe they mean Mana
02:26 - maybe terrains features quite an
02:29 - impressive amount of content for a free
02:30 - asset there's also a even more expansive
02:33 - paid version if you like what you see
02:34 - then if you need some highly optimized
02:36 - graphs using your game check out this
02:38 - one supports a massive amount of grass
02:40 - all the blades are individually rendered
02:42 - you can enable the player and objects to
02:45 - interact with laguaras so that looks
02:46 - great it also supports lighting and
02:49 - grass painting and works in urp this one
02:51 - is just a free demo but it works really
02:53 - great so I want to include it you cannot
02:55 - make a build but you can use this while
02:57 - developing your game and if it fits your
02:58 - game then check out the phone version
03:00 - then if you need some customizable
03:02 - avatars look at this one if you'd like
03:04 - to add player customization to your game
03:06 - then don't like this one can be quite
03:07 - harmful features lots of parameters you
03:10 - can tweak to get tons of customization
03:11 - it's easily modifiable so you can even
03:13 - add your own custom pieces of clothing
03:15 - next up something nice and simple a
03:18 - bunch of pixel art emojis it looks
03:20 - exactly to expect all of it really nice
03:22 - so if your game has lots of text analog
03:24 - then adding some emojis like this can
03:26 - really help your attack stand out then
03:27 - if you're working on some kind of water
03:29 - game and you need a submarine look at
03:31 - this one this one is low poly I quite
03:33 - like the sound on this one I think the
03:35 - solid colors look pretty great
03:37 - for me the first thing that comes to
03:38 - mind is this would be a great fit in an
03:40 - RTS I remember playing red alert and
03:42 - having tons of fun with submarines and
03:44 - if you like this style then this dev has
03:46 - tons more stuff next for a nice song
03:48 - Here is readme light it's a tool for
03:51 - helping you easily and quickly create
03:52 - some readme objects this can be
03:55 - excellent for adding some documentation
03:56 - directly onto your objects so no need to
03:59 - open up a script you just select the
04:00 - object and read what it does features
04:03 - quite a lot of options you can even drag
04:04 - and drop some references directly in the
04:06 - text so this seems like a really useful
04:08 - tool then one that looks pretty
04:10 - interesting although I'm not entirely
04:11 - sure I understand this one is all about
04:13 - sign business fields which is a topic
04:15 - that I've wanted to research for quite
04:17 - some time I really only know the basics
04:18 - of what it means here this basically
04:21 - adds some nodes to Shader graph to be
04:22 - able to use SDF in your shaders it
04:24 - basically lets you create some shapes
04:26 - and play around the thickness and how
04:27 - they show up for example I use something
04:29 - similar to this in the transition effect
04:31 - from Hades so it seems like this would
04:33 - be useful for making that kind of effect
04:34 - much easier then if you use attribute
04:37 - it's in our scripts and you want a bunch
04:38 - more here's a great pack it adds 9
04:41 - attributes doing all kinds of things so
04:43 - you can easily add some icons colors and
04:45 - labels you can change how they can be
04:46 - modified and you can add some drop downs
04:49 - in lists and a bunch more alright so
04:51 - those are my top 10 free new assets on
04:53 - the NTS store for October 22. there's
04:55 - links on the description and also check
04:57 - out my own free input ass on store
