01:01 - is also the best time both these sales
01:03 - and tomorrow so check them out quickly
01:05 - alright so starting off with a really
01:07 - awesome tool for taking your spreadsheet
01:09 - animations and making them really fluid
01:11 - with just one click you can turn your
01:13 - flip box and make them extremely smooth
01:15 - the results really speak for themselves
01:17 - quite a massive difference flip books or
01:19 - sprite sheets are always an excellent
01:21 - way to have some very complex looking
01:22 - visuals but make them really performant
01:25 - the main downside is usually they look a
01:26 - bit janky due to the limited frame rate
01:29 - but with this they look perfectly smooth
01:31 - next up if you need some really high end
01:33 - liquids here's zebra and liquids i
01:35 - actually also covered this one in the
01:37 - free assets video because it also has a
01:39 - free version that one has some
01:40 - limitations but this one has everything
01:43 - visually you can see it looks really
01:45 - excellent great visuals and it reacts
01:47 - perfectly with all the collaterals
01:49 - lots of splashes waves and everything
01:51 - it's gpu powered so that makes it very
01:54 - performant works in both urp and agrp
01:57 - next up polish your attacks with anima
01:59 - text wherever you have text in your game
02:02 - usually it always looks better if it's
02:04 - animated in some way
02:05 - this one's got tons of effects over 80
02:08 - which you can then customize in tons of
02:10 - different ways works with both the
02:12 - legacy u-gui as well as text mesh pro
02:15 - also works with rich text tags so you
02:17 - can apply some bold italic color and it
02:19 - all works perfectly and it also works
02:21 - with any emojis sprites or anything so
02:24 - if you have any sort of text in your
02:26 - game you can make it look a bit better
02:27 - by making it animated then if you want a
02:30 - nice level editor tool here is edimapp
02:32 - it helps you design levels both in 2d
02:35 - and 3d
02:36 - just click to select an object and click
02:38 - to place it it's optimized to reduce
02:40 - draw calls and it also supports depth so
02:43 - you can easily make levels with multiple
02:45 - fours next up manage your ui with doozy
02:47 - ui manager this is one of those tools
02:50 - that is extremely capable and very
02:52 - complex but if you do take the time to
02:54 - learn it it can be very useful it
02:56 - contains multiple individual tools for
02:58 - doing all kinds of things you've got a
03:00 - tool for easily animating ui elements
03:03 - another one for sending messages between
03:05 - objects and also a nice visual tool to
03:07 - see the flow of your buttons
03:09 - it's already got tons of reviews so
03:11 - plenty of people have already found this
03:12 - very helpful up next here's a fun one
03:15 - stick figure it's a tool for creating
03:17 - and animating 2d characters
03:20 - now this one is not based on bones which
03:22 - means it has some pros and cons you can
03:24 - easily animate the characters by just
03:26 - moving the handles
03:28 - but also without bones makes it a bit
03:29 - hard to do some ragdolls so it really
03:32 - depends on what style you're going for
03:34 - seems like this would be great for
03:35 - animators who want to quickly animate
03:37 - some things inside of unity then here's
03:39 - an interesting one for object editing
03:41 - it's a safe system for your editor it
03:44 - has support for many many saves
03:46 - so what you can do is you place down
03:48 - objects in your scene you hit a button
03:50 - and the exact state is saved
03:52 - then if you want you can load that state
03:54 - back
03:55 - meaning that this can be super useful
03:56 - for helping you avoid having to create
03:58 - multiple scenes or multiple prefabs with
04:00 - all the objects in different states like
04:03 - for example in a scene with a bar fight
04:05 - you can save the state with all the
04:06 - props in their place then another save
04:08 - for all the parts on the floor and then
04:10 - dynamically simply load which one you
04:12 - want
04:12 - this works with pretty much everything
04:14 - so you can also play around with
04:15 - lighting settings save and load play
04:17 - with signs weather ui or anything
04:20 - definitely a very unique tool that i can
04:22 - see being quite useful up next if you
04:24 - need some really nice realistic rivers
04:26 - here is infini river like the name
04:28 - implies it's a water simulator primarily
04:30 - meant for simulating rivers
04:32 - the main thing being that you can place
04:34 - on rocks anywhere and water simulation
04:36 - accurately goes around it but of course
04:38 - liquid doesn't really just mean water so
04:40 - it can be lava mud or anything you want
04:43 - up next here's an interesting tool to
04:45 - create tons of content for your 2d games
04:47 - you select the various regions that make
04:49 - up the sprites and then you can easily
04:51 - apply all kinds of modifications to each
04:53 - region so you can play around the hue
04:56 - saturation or make it completely random
04:58 - this can really help cut down the amount
05:00 - of work you need to do if you have lots
05:02 - of similar looking items and being able
05:04 - to define those regions means that it
05:06 - looks much better than having to tint
05:08 - the entire object and finally here's
05:10 - another fluid simulator less than this
05:12 - month this one is in 2.5 d so it
05:15 - definitely enables different use cases
05:16 - from the other ones
05:18 - it's called fluid simulation so it's
05:19 - really not just liquids it works great
05:22 - for fire smoke gas or anything it really
05:25 - looks great for some smoke while the
05:26 - character moves or maybe just some paint
05:28 - swirling around
05:29 - and since the simulation is in 2d that
05:31 - means that it should be very performant
05:33 - alright so those are my top 10 new tools
05:35 - and systems on the unity asset store for
05:37 - november 2021 there's links to all in
05:40 - the description and as a bonus you can
