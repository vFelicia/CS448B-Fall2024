00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here we have a massive unity mega
00:04 - model you can get
00:05 - over 800 worth of assets for 95 off
00:08 - this one is all about level building
00:10 - tools it's a super deep discount so even
00:12 - if just one of these assets looks
00:14 - interesting then the home bundle is a
00:16 - great deal
00:17 - the funnel is split into three tiers all
00:19 - of them deeply discounted with the
00:20 - biggest deal on the third tier at 95
00:22 - off all right so let's check out some of
00:25 - these assets
00:26 - starting off on the first year with
00:28 - runtime transform gizmos
00:30 - just like the name implies you can get
00:31 - the usual transform gizmos that you have
00:33 - available in the editor
00:34 - but use them during runtime while
00:36 - playing the game this is super useful if
00:38 - you have a level editor tool that is
00:40 - made for working during runtime
00:42 - being able to do a level design while
00:44 - playing the game and moving the player
00:45 - character is great for some super fast
00:47 - iteration
00:48 - the hardest part of making a runtime
00:50 - level editor is the handle so this is
00:52 - incredibly useful
00:53 - then in order to handle loading between
00:56 - levels here is loading screen studio
00:58 - easily creates some good looking and
01:00 - smooth loading screens with this package
01:02 - includes a bunch of easy to use presets
01:04 - with titles tips and backgrounds
01:06 - supports async loading press any key and
01:08 - it all runs on a single line of code
01:10 - next up on tier 2 for some visuals here
01:13 - is fog volume 3
01:15 - adding some fog will instantly add a
01:17 - great sense of sound to your game
01:19 - it's designed to model a wide range of
01:21 - atmospheric effects
01:22 - everything from simple clouds to some
01:24 - fallon storms
01:26 - combined with some lighting for some
01:27 - awesome god rays to make some truly
01:29 - gorgeous worlds
01:30 - it looks great it's fully controllable
01:32 - and very performant
01:34 - if your game involves dungeons then here
01:36 - is dungeon maker
01:37 - it's a tool for helping you connect some
01:39 - rooms together to make
01:40 - large and complex dungeons build your
01:42 - base room set them up as prefabs and
01:44 - define the room entry and exit points
01:46 - then create the dungeon object to set up
01:48 - all the rooms and the various
01:49 - connections
01:50 - and finally take all that design data
01:52 - and dynamically generate a dungeon
01:54 - the rooms are all randomly generated but
01:56 - they do keep the same
01:57 - dungeon layout so it keeps things fresh
02:00 - while keeping design control over the
02:01 - layout
02:02 - and then the final tier is full of
02:04 - awesome stuff
02:05 - make your games feel really alive with
02:07 - the mesh deformation full collection
02:09 - this is a massive collection of mesh
02:11 - tools you can manipulate meshes
02:14 - paint over them sculpt morph deform it's
02:17 - been around
02:18 - for five years now so it's a very mature
02:20 - tool if you have some meshes that you
02:22 - wish were just a tiny bit different
02:23 - or you wanted to massively modify them
02:25 - then this is the perfect tool
02:27 - it even works in vr which is great for
02:29 - playing around and sculpting objects
02:30 - while you're directly inside the world
02:33 - for some more assets here is a medieval
02:35 - village environment
02:36 - it's a great looking village lots of
02:38 - wood everywhere build some exteriors
02:40 - with a bunch of prefabs and fill in the
02:42 - interiors with over 50 props
02:44 - includes a demo scene to see it all in
02:46 - action if you end up building a giant
02:48 - world and performance starts taking a
02:50 - hit
02:50 - then look into impossers it's a tool
02:53 - that takes your high-end 3d models with
02:55 - tons of vertices and simplifies them
02:57 - down to simple quads
02:58 - the end results can be pretty drastic
03:01 - achieving up to 20 times
03:02 - performance improvements while looking
03:04 - visually very much the same
03:06 - it's super easy to use no need to do any
03:08 - special asset pre-processing and doesn't
03:10 - create any extra assets
03:12 - no need to manually make any lods
03:14 - yourself everything is generated at
03:16 - runtime and it utilizes dots with burst
03:19 - and the job system in order to achieve
03:20 - some massive performance
03:22 - since this bundle is all about creating
03:24 - levels this asset is simple but
03:26 - extremely useful
03:27 - the full screen editor it does exactly
03:30 - what the name implies
03:31 - it takes your editor and makes it
03:33 - completely full screen
03:34 - so naturally that's super useful when
03:36 - you're level building just select the
03:38 - scene view and put it on phone screen to
03:40 - get tons of space to work with
03:42 - and it also works when in play mode so
03:44 - if you're testing your game
03:45 - sometimes there's some things that need
03:46 - to be tested in full screen and with
03:48 - this you no longer have to make a
03:49 - separate build
03:50 - then there's gravit i've mentioned this
03:52 - one before in some previous sales it's a
03:54 - tool for easily making some natural
03:56 - looking environments
03:58 - just grab whatever props you want move
04:00 - them and watch as they fall according to
04:02 - gravity
04:03 - so you don't have to paint syncingly
04:05 - position every object to ensure there's
04:07 - no clipping
04:08 - you just grab it drop it and that's it
04:10 - i've had maya on this one for a while so
04:12 - the whole bundle is worth it just for
04:14 - this one
04:14 - then here's an interesting one for you
04:16 - to keep track and help you
04:18 - actually finish your games it's called
04:20 - task atlas
04:21 - and lets you place down notes and
04:23 - post-its all over your level so you know
04:25 - what needs to be done
04:26 - you can view all of your tasks and all
04:28 - of your landmarks in a nice list
04:30 - definitely a unique asset that has a lot
04:33 - of potential to be extremely helpful
04:35 - all right so those are just some of the
04:37 - highlights from the bundle it's a really
04:39 - deep discount you get over 800
04:41 - worth of assets for just 40 bucks so if
04:44 - you're interested in just one asset then
04:45 - picking up the home bundle is worth it
