00:11 - free assets and next ones I'll be
00:12 - covering paid assets and tools let me
00:14 - know in the comments if you pick up any
00:15 - of these and what you intend to do with
00:16 - them also if you need some awesome low
00:18 - poly aets right now there's a really
00:20 - excellent Humble Bundle tons and tons of
00:22 - aets for all kinds of games with a super
00:23 - deep discount personally I love this
00:25 - ancient empire pack it always makes me
00:27 - want to make some kind of game like 300
00:29 - or for some nice zombies There's a city
00:31 - zombies pack maybe there's one if you'd
00:32 - like to make some kind of farming game
00:34 - one if you'd like to make some kind of
00:35 - office tycoon or town game you've got
00:37 - fantasy characters nightclubs icons even
00:40 - the really useful prototype pack and a
00:42 - really awesome spy kit so as you can see
00:44 - tons and tons of really awesome low po
00:46 - asses help you make pretty much any game
00:47 - you can imagine all it at a pretty low
00:49 - price just 25 bucks so go ahead and get
00:51 - it with the link in the description all
00:52 - right so on to the top 10 list starting
00:54 - off with a really awesome visual effect
00:56 - that looks just like VHS it's got quite
00:58 - a few options to add scand lines and
01:00 - some glitchy movement it looks very good
01:02 - definitely looks exactly like VHS so if
01:04 - that's a style you're working for then
01:06 - this would be perfect this one works
01:07 - with the volume system so it's a super
01:09 - easy postprocessing effect that you can
01:11 - easily add to any game then if you're
01:13 - making a mobile game and you want a
01:14 - quick and easy virtual joystick check
01:16 - out this one it is exactly what you
01:18 - expect it's a virtual onscreen joystick
01:20 - you just drag it onto your project and
01:21 - works right away you can click drag to
01:24 - move shoot and do whatever you want and
01:26 - it also includes support for multiple
01:27 - joysticks now this is something that
01:28 - I've been wanting to cover in tutorial
01:30 - for ages but if you don't want to take
01:32 - the time to build yourself you can just
01:33 - use this free asset next for a fun
01:35 - visual here is an ice cream truck it's a
01:37 - pretty nice model it's low poly with a
01:39 - bunch of colors growing up I love
01:41 - playing a game called lemonade Tycoon
01:42 - where you saw lemonade from a van and
01:44 - customers showed up so I could see a
01:45 - game just like that being made with this
01:47 - truck model or if instead you want an
01:49 - entire city then check out this one it
01:51 - looks quite nice the roads are actually
01:53 - very realistic with the roads the curb
01:55 - the lights and so on so if you'd like to
01:56 - make your own car game or something like
01:58 - GTA then this would be excellent
02:00 - starting point next for a useful tool
02:02 - here is one to help you add a bunch more
02:04 - control to your Cod routines this is
02:06 - basically a timing system that has a bit
02:08 - more control like giving it a custom
02:10 - Delta time or updating in a specific
02:12 - order normally I build my own timing
02:13 - systems for my games for example on
02:15 - dinky Guardians I have a timing system
02:17 - specifically to handle the offw logic
02:19 - but if you don't want to build yourself
02:20 - then this could be a great help then for
02:22 - another fun visual here is a low poly
02:24 - excavator I quite like this style it's
02:26 - very low poly with some solid bright
02:28 - colors it's split into pieces so you can
02:29 - very easily animated looking at this
02:31 - makes me want to make a fun Machine
02:32 - controller script I think that would be
02:34 - interesting and then if you want to take
02:35 - this further this dev has tons more
02:37 - machines in the exact same style next
02:39 - here's a super useful tool it's a script
02:41 - ball object table view this one is
02:43 - pretty simple and does exactly one thing
02:45 - very well you can select a script ball
02:47 - object type and it shows you a table
02:48 - with all the objects in all the fields
02:50 - if you use a lot of script B objects in
02:52 - your game then a tool like this one can
02:54 - really help save you a ton of time from
02:55 - having to swap between objects back and
02:57 - forth then for another fun visual here's
02:59 - a low poly zombie Hospital character
03:01 - this could be great for an enemy in some
03:03 - kind of Hospital zombie game maybe
03:04 - something inspired by episode one of The
03:06 - Walking Dead and if you want some more
03:08 - then this dev has an entire zombie
03:10 - Hospital pack then if you want to make
03:11 - your worlds come alive one way to do
03:13 - that is to add some trees to your world
03:15 - here's a free pack with a whole bunch of
03:17 - different ones there's actually a ton of
03:18 - variety over 60 trees and bushes in this
03:20 - one free pack with all different colors
03:22 - you could very easily make all kinds of
03:24 - biomes and then if you're making a game
03:26 - set inside the human body check out
03:27 - these virus models there's some spiky
03:29 - round ones some that are tiny and some
03:31 - with some creepy tentacles I could
03:33 - imagine a game kind of like an RTS where
03:34 - you control the body's defenses against
03:36 - these viruses with all of these model
03:38 - differences if you apply some different
03:40 - materials with some scale differences
03:42 - you could make a ton of enemy types just
03:43 - from this one pack all right so those
03:45 - are my top 10 free new assets on the NTS
03:47 - store for March 24 there's Link in the
03:49 - description and also check out my own
