00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're going to make a
00:03 - Health System we're going to build a
00:05 - class it can he'll take damage and
00:07 - display it as a health bar let's get
00:09 - started
00:14 - so to start off I have a basic scene
00:17 - here with a player character just moving
00:19 - around you can download the entire
00:21 - project from unity code monkey calm so
00:25 - the simplest Health System is a basic
00:27 - number if it's positive the unit is
00:29 - alive if it reaches zero the unit is
00:30 - dead so let's start by creating a new
00:34 - c-sharp script and call it health system
00:39 - ok remove all the references to
00:42 - monobehaviour since we want this to be
00:44 - an independent class and let's start by
00:47 - making a constructor so public health
00:51 - system and it will take an int for our
00:59 - private Oh set this dot help equals
01:03 - health all right
01:08 - so in order to get the health from our
01:10 - health system we're going to make a
01:12 - function rather than making our variable
01:14 - public in order to make our code nice
01:16 - and clean so public in get help
01:19 - it won't simply return our current home
01:23 - so here let's test things out and create
01:28 - the new health system equals new health
01:31 - system with a hundred and just debug log
01:35 - our current health was health system
01:38 - doctor get help so let's test it and our
01:43 - console should say 100 yep health 100
01:48 - great so let's add some basic functions
01:54 - to our health system
01:55 - first of all public boy damage takes an
01:59 - import damage amount and simply reduce
02:03 - our health by the damage a mouse and a
02:09 - public void heal which will take
02:13 - amount and increase our health by the
02:17 - heal amount so in order to test it new
02:22 - health system dot damage caused a 10
02:25 - points of damage print it again and get
02:31 - back up and print it again so now it
02:35 - should print 100 90 100 yep there it is
02:42 - now in order to make testing easier I'm
02:46 - going to create some debug buttons using
02:48 - the code monkey utilities as always you
02:51 - can grab the utilities from unity code
02:52 - monkey calm so I'm going to use the
02:54 - class CMD bug to create a new button on
02:58 - the UI and please stop button above and
03:04 - to the right give it a text damage and
03:09 - the function at the bottom one will
03:11 - trigger is the Health System damage and
03:14 - cause of 10 points of damage
03:17 - pranks are current health health was
03:24 - health system dot get help and place
03:32 - another button on the left side in order
03:36 - to heal and set of damage okay let's
03:43 - test the buttons yep we got here we can
03:49 - cause damage and the health goes down we
03:52 - can heal and then all that goes up great
03:56 - now in order to build our health bar we
03:59 - need to have the maximum health so let's
04:03 - have that proteins health max and in the
04:06 - constructor instead of receiving the
04:08 - helm we're going to receive the health
04:10 - mugs and set the health to the health
04:12 - max now in here we're also going to make
04:16 - sure that health stays within valid
04:18 - values if he'll goes under zero then the
04:23 - health equals zero and here if he'll
04:27 - goes above hell max then healthy closed
04:32 - health max test it again make sure it
04:37 - stays within the valid ranges damage
04:42 - keeps going down and stays under zero
04:44 - heal and doesn't go above a hundred
04:47 - great so now we're going to make the
04:53 - health bar create a new object call it
04:56 - health bar place it just slightly above
05:00 - the player create a background and just
05:09 - the sprite renderer with the basic one
05:15 - pixel just turn yep
05:20 - make another one for our bar sprite make
05:24 - it in red
05:25 - put the sorting order above the
05:27 - background and make a container for our
05:31 - bar sprite make the bar spray a child
05:35 - and shift it to the right bar to the
05:41 - left make the background in dark gray
05:46 - and place the bar there okay great so
05:50 - now we have our bar with collar here the
05:52 - background here and the container which
05:54 - we can modify the scale so now all we
05:58 - need is to represent our health between
06:00 - zero and one
06:02 - so essentially percentage so here in our
06:08 - health system we're going to make
06:09 - another public it's going to return a
06:11 - float it's going to be get health
06:13 - percent simply return the help / the
06:19 - help max and now in here we're going to
06:23 - get health person and then do health
06:28 - system damage give the ten points of
06:30 - damage and print it again so in theory
06:32 - this should print one this should print
06:34 - 0.9 let's try and in reality it doesn't
06:41 - it print zero reason for that is because
06:44 - we are using intz on our health system
06:46 - so the result is being cast down to an
06:48 - init easiest way to do this is to
06:50 - convert one of these just to a float and
06:54 - now it should say 1 and 0.9 yep great
07:01 - now that we have our health percentage
07:04 - we need to make a new script which will
07:07 - manage our health bar
07:13 - going to have a public boy function or
07:17 - set up in order to give that Health
07:21 - System system and on a private void on
07:31 - our update need to do transformed fine
07:36 - our bar and change the local scale it
07:41 - won't be new vector3 and on the X we're
07:44 - going to get the Health System dot get
07:46 - help percent on the Y just one scene
07:51 - here add the health bar to our health
07:55 - bar and we're going to need a reference
07:58 - in order to call this setup so on the
08:00 - game hammer here public health bar L bar
08:04 - then we're going to do how far down
08:07 - setup with our health system
08:20 - in here and put it in there and now the
08:26 - health bar should be correctly set up
08:28 - and display the value yep that goes up
08:33 - goes down great works so now that the
08:37 - health bar is working we're actually
08:38 - going to improve it slightly and here
08:41 - we're currently running this on every
08:43 - update it works but it's very wasteful
08:46 - and since it's updating every frame even
08:49 - when nothing changes now we just one
08:51 - health bar it's not a problem but if you
08:53 - have a thousand it would be a
08:55 - performance issue so we want the bar to
08:59 - just update when the health system
09:01 - actually changes in order to do that
09:03 - we're going to use events so in our
09:05 - health system we're going to make a
09:07 - public event use event handler and just
09:11 - on health change event handler is in the
09:18 - system namespace and we're going to
09:21 - trigger this event when it actually
09:24 - changes so in here if or if there are
09:28 - subscribers to our then we're going to
09:30 - trigger it that's our X dot empty same
09:33 - thing down here and now on our health
09:36 - bar instead of doing it on the update
09:38 - we're going to make health system dot on
09:42 - health changed we're going to
09:47 - we need to do the update when the helm
09:49 - actually changes so right now it should
09:51 - be working exactly the same but in terms
09:54 - of performance it is much better yep
09:59 - there you go still friends exactly as it
10:02 - should it's not in order to be able to
10:05 - create multiple health bars let's create
10:08 - a prefab call it the PF health bar and
10:14 - just drag our health bar onto it delete
10:18 - it from the scene and on the game
10:23 - handler instead of having a reference
10:24 - door how far to have reference to
10:27 - transform for the PF L bar now we're
10:33 - going to instantiate our PF bar 3 0
10:50 - transform accentuated and then transform
10:57 - getcomponent
11:02 - alright ok so now let's add a reference
11:06 - and everything should be working the
11:09 - same have this health bar and I can
11:13 - damage making hue and that's it now we
11:17 - have our health system that can
11:19 - correctly heal and take damage and
11:21 - represents itself as a health bar which
11:23 - we can in sentient in any number of
11:26 - objects like the player enemies or
11:28 - destructible objects anything you want
11:30 - you can have a health system with a
11:32 - health bar if you have any questions
11:35 - post them in the comments and I'll do my
11:37 - best to answer them right see you next
11:39 - time
