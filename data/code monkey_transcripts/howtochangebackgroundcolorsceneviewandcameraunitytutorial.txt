00:00 - how to change the background color on
00:01 - scene view and camera view first on the
00:04 - camera under environment you have
00:06 - several options you can show a skybox or
00:08 - a solid color and then you can pick
00:10 - whatever color you want
00:12 - but even if you set that the scene view
00:13 - is still different still showing a
00:15 - skybox
00:16 - go into window and lighting
00:18 - and here you can change the skybox or
00:20 - remove it entirely if you remove it then
00:22 - the scene view will now show a solid
00:24 - color
00:25 - however this one is separate from the
00:26 - camera color and the game view to change
00:29 - the background color on the scene view
00:31 - go into edit preferences color then here
00:34 - find scene background and change to
00:36 - whatever color you want
