00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made with unity released in
00:05 - september 2021 there's lots of great
00:07 - ones this month and they are especially
00:09 - great in terms of teaching you how you
00:11 - absolutely need to make sure your game
00:12 - visually stands out almost every game on
00:15 - this list is very visually unique and
00:17 - you couldn't possibly confuse it for
00:18 - anything else that is also what you
00:20 - should be trying to do in your own games
00:22 - make it immediately stand out as much as
00:23 - possible that is where great marketing
00:25 - starts and again these games are your
00:27 - competition all of these games are
00:29 - uniquely impressive and they showcase
00:30 - the power of the engine in tons of
00:31 - different scenarios so the list is in no
00:33 - particular order except for the number
00:35 - one game that is my personal pick of the
00:37 - month by the way there's a mega bundle
00:39 - happening right now on the unity
00:40 - assessor as usual it's a super deep
00:43 - discount up to 95 off it contains lots
00:46 - of interesting tools so there's one to
00:47 - help you manage an inventory database
00:50 - another one for placing some decals and
00:52 - the terrain system there's a digging
00:54 - system you can slice meshes volumetric
00:56 - vfx and tons more as usual with such a
00:58 - deep discount it's worth it if just one
01:00 - of these assets looks interesting check
01:02 - it out with the link in the description
01:04 - alright so starting off at number 10
01:06 - with one that's been upcoming for
01:07 - several years and finally came out save
01:10 - all
01:10 - it was first announced at e3 in 2018 and
01:13 - the unique look caused everyone to pay
01:15 - attention right away it's a very
01:17 - stylized world with some great music as
01:19 - you embark upon your journey and guide
01:21 - saban through the vast deserts and
01:22 - mesmerizing landscapes
01:24 - in terms of gameplay it's an open world
01:26 - exploration story based game you collide
01:29 - around talking to people and exploring
01:31 - this visually unique world
01:33 - it's also available in game pass so if
01:35 - you have that definitely look into it
01:37 - just to admire the visuals
01:38 - next up another one that is also
01:40 - extremely visually unique while also
01:42 - being very unique in terms of theme and
01:44 - mechanics push and craft alchemist
01:46 - simulator
01:47 - like the name implies you craft potions
01:49 - and you do so in a very minimal way
01:51 - grinding flowers to dust stirring the
01:53 - pot managing the heat and so on
01:55 - customers come into your shop and they
01:57 - demand certain potions so then you go
01:59 - out you grab some ingredients use your
02:01 - tools and craft the final potion combine
02:03 - ingredients make your own custom recipes
02:05 - so you can make a healing potion or
02:07 - maybe make some poison customize your
02:09 - bottles in order to make your potions
02:11 - stand out it really is a very unique
02:13 - concept a very unique game which when
02:15 - coupled with a unique interesting look
02:17 - really makes for something that has the
02:19 - potential to achieve quite massive
02:20 - success
02:21 - it's only just come out of early access
02:23 - and it already has over 2000 very
02:26 - positive reviews so definitely another
02:28 - great example on how to find success
02:30 - with a unique concept and some very good
02:32 - marketing then here's a nice indie
02:34 - sequel origami 2. i played the first one
02:37 - quite a while ago and i really enjoyed
02:38 - the concept my only dislike was that the
02:40 - game felt really stiff
02:42 - but by looking at the trailer for this
02:43 - one it looks to solve that problem so
02:45 - i'm very much looking forward to giving
02:47 - this one a try since the concept is
02:48 - indeed very great it's a stealth game
02:50 - where you play as an assassin with the
02:52 - power to control shadows you're
02:54 - vulnerable in light but you have the
02:56 - ability to blink between shadows and
02:58 - create some shadow areas lots of skills
03:01 - and abilities you can use to take out on
03:02 - your foes you can also play solo or with
03:05 - friends for some interesting co-op
03:06 - action this one is also available on
03:09 - game pass so if you have that definitely
03:10 - look into it
03:12 - then if you want to just chill out for a
03:14 - bit check out cloud gardens it's all
03:16 - about using plants to make a
03:18 - post-apocalyptic world come to life it's
03:20 - a very unique concept with a great
03:22 - visual sound in terms of gameplay it's
03:24 - somewhere between a sandbox toy and a
03:26 - game with challenges
03:28 - relax as you place down objects cover
03:30 - them in foliage and just keep doing that
03:33 - it's a very zen-like relaxing experience
03:35 - you create beautiful dioramas and then
03:37 - just share them with your friends by the
03:39 - way if you find the video helpful please
03:41 - hit the like button it's a tiny thing
03:42 - but really does help thanks next up for
03:45 - some vr here is iron guard vr it's a
03:48 - tower defense game so on the one hand
03:50 - you can build some towers and with the
03:52 - other hand you control a spaceship
03:54 - letting you directly damage enemies
03:57 - you have many towers to place resources
03:59 - together and upgrades to take out your
04:00 - enemies
04:01 - features 360 degree immersive gameplay
04:04 - with a unique storytelling including
04:06 - voice acting according to the reviews
04:08 - the game is exactly just a tower defense
04:10 - game so nothing else too unique but if
04:13 - all you want is tower defense in vr then
04:15 - this one is exactly that and up next one
04:17 - that just came out after a very
04:19 - successful time in early access
04:21 - pathfinder wrath of the righteous it's
04:23 - an epic rpg play your hero your own way
04:26 - very much focused on giving you plenty
04:28 - of choice to create exactly the
04:30 - character you want and play it in any
04:31 - way you desire
04:33 - choose from 25 classes 12 races and over
04:36 - a thousand spells
04:37 - includes two modes for combat real time
04:40 - with pause or turn based so that's a
04:42 - pretty interesting feature usually you
04:44 - only get just one or the other
04:46 - the game features some truly gorgeous
04:48 - particle effects tons of particles with
04:50 - lots of glow lots of movement everything
04:52 - looks really great
04:54 - it does make me wonder if they're using
04:55 - vfx graph for these effects some of them
04:57 - look like tons and tons of particles so
04:59 - they might be doing that
05:01 - choose your own path and lead your party
05:02 - to victory it's got over 7000 very
05:05 - positive reviews so if you're interested
05:07 - in this genre definitely give it a try
05:09 - then if you've ever wanted to play as a
05:11 - mouse warrior then check out tales of
05:13 - iron
05:14 - it's an rpg adventure with some brutal
05:16 - combat lots of enemies and bosses to
05:19 - battle lots of weapons to try out and
05:21 - many companions to meet
05:23 - this one features great use of 2d and
05:25 - lighting i believe they are indeed using
05:27 - the urp 2d renderer with the specific 2d
05:29 - lights
05:30 - by using that it does make the game look
05:32 - really gorgeous every scene is packed
05:34 - with detail you've got several parallax
05:36 - backgrounds with some particles of it
05:38 - perfectly lit
05:39 - and it also looks like maybe they are
05:41 - also using the 2d skeletal system you
05:44 - can equip all kinds of weapons with your
05:46 - character and it works great with any
05:47 - animations so if you're working on a 2d
05:50 - game with 2d and lighting definitely
05:51 - study how this game does it another one
05:54 - with a very unique look is toim it's in
05:57 - black and white with a nice mixture of
05:59 - 2d and 3d and a really interesting
06:01 - camera mechanic
06:02 - it describes itself as a photo adventure
06:05 - you set off on a delightful expedition
06:07 - and use your camera to uncover the
06:09 - mysteries of this world it's a pretty
06:11 - relaxing experience you've got no combat
06:14 - meet some quirky characters and help
06:16 - solve their problems by snapping some
06:18 - neat photos and solving puzzles this one
06:20 - is a great example of a unique game with
06:22 - a visual that sounds out immediately
06:24 - which makes for some really great gifts
06:26 - because of that it's already got a very
06:28 - nice amount of reviews with a nearly 100
06:30 - positive rating
06:32 - then here's a really special one madness
06:34 - project nexus it seems like an odd title
06:37 - but as soon as i started watching the
06:38 - trailer i got it right away if you're
06:40 - around my age and you also played flash
06:42 - games during your youth then chances are
06:44 - you've played one of the madness games
06:45 - or watched the videos
06:46 - those games were so good they had the
06:48 - best shooting in pretty much any flash
06:50 - game lots of particles punchy sound
06:52 - effects and awesome animations so this
06:54 - game is exactly that but with modern
06:56 - technology
06:57 - they've somehow managed to convert the
06:59 - 2d sprites into 3d models in a way that
07:01 - looks perfectly awesome
07:03 - it's got all of the arcade action you
07:04 - expect with tons of weapons and lots of
07:06 - crazy characters and the game itself
07:08 - already has over 1500 overwhelmingly
07:11 - positive reviews so this one clearly is
07:13 - not just nostalgia it's an actually
07:15 - great game
07:16 - and at number one for my personal pick
07:18 - of the month here is timberborne
07:20 - it calls itself a lumber punk city
07:23 - builder game
07:24 - basically humanity is gone and beavers
07:26 - are all that's left so can they rebuild
07:28 - better than the humans that is the
07:30 - question it is certainly a pretty unique
07:32 - theme
07:33 - being a game based on beavers then
07:35 - naturally a lot of the mechanics revolve
07:37 - around controlling water which makes it
07:38 - send out from other city builders
07:41 - you can terraform to create some new
07:43 - rivers use the water to power your
07:44 - structures and stay safe during the
07:46 - drought by saving up water during the
07:48 - wet times
07:49 - also features some very vertical
07:51 - construction so instead of placing down
07:53 - a simple house you can actually build it
07:55 - up with multiple levels and floors so
07:57 - that looks like a pretty interesting
07:59 - mechanic
08:00 - so if you've got a game idea where you
08:01 - want to learn how to add rivers and
08:03 - flowing water into your games then study
08:05 - this one to see how the water behaves
08:07 - it's already overwhelmingly positive
08:09 - with over 2 000 reviews at 95 positive
08:12 - that's a massively good result for
08:14 - something that just came out of early
08:16 - access alright so that's 10 awesome new
08:18 - games made with unity and launched in
08:19 - september 2021 lots of variety for what
08:22 - the engine can do
08:24 - if you want to be successful in the game
08:25 - developer you definitely need to keep an
08:27 - eye on the current state of your
08:28 - competition i make these videos once a
08:30 - month so i can keep up to date with
