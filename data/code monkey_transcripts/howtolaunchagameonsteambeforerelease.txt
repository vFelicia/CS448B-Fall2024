00:00 - in this video I'm going to go over what
00:01 - you should do to prepare before I'm
00:03 - releasing a game on Steam I'll go over
00:05 - the various tasks that I do before the
00:07 - game is ready for launch in order to
00:09 - increase the chances of success this is
00:11 - my general to-do list that i have
00:12 - crafted over my 8 steam releases alright
00:15 - let's begin
00:19 - [Music]
00:23 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:25 - and this channel is all about helping
00:27 - you learn how to make your own games
00:28 - with nf2 torrents made by a professional
00:30 - indie game developer so if you find the
00:32 - video helpful consider subscribing ok so
00:35 - here is my complete general to-do list
00:37 - this is the list that I followed before
00:39 - release and then there's another list of
00:41 - things to do right after roy's I'll go
00:43 - over a point-by-point what each element
00:45 - represents and why it's important if you
00:47 - follow this list your chances of finding
00:49 - success on its team increases
00:50 - dramatically first here is the before
00:52 - release list this assumes your game is
00:55 - pretty much fully complete usually for
00:58 - me I do most of these things in the last
01:00 - two to three weeks before release it is
01:02 - important to have the game pretty much
01:03 - done since you need to record footage
01:05 - for the trailer and grab some
01:06 - screenshots so let's start there with
01:08 - preparing the Store page this one should
01:11 - actually be done before release but then
01:13 - it should be updated right as you're
01:15 - about to watch one of the most important
01:18 - elements to find success on Steam is to
01:20 - gather a large number of wish lists
01:21 - before you launch so as soon as your
01:23 - game is ready enough to be announced you
01:25 - should have a steam page ready to
01:27 - collect those wish lists and right
01:29 - before you launch you should review the
01:31 - store page and improve it your text
01:33 - should be very quick and to the point no
01:36 - one is going to read the wrong text so
01:37 - stick to short sentences and both points
01:40 - always write your text from the point of
01:42 - view of what benefit it provides the
01:44 - player so for example instead of saying
01:46 - features 10 weapons you should say
01:48 - destroy your enemies with 10 different
01:50 - weapons unseen we can also add gifts to
01:53 - your store page so make sure you do that
01:55 - animated gifts are a great way to
01:57 - quickly grab someone's attention and
01:59 - make sure you update the store page to
02:02 - indicate on the various Steam features
02:03 - that the game has on with its languages
02:05 - and your median links then one of the
02:08 - most important pieces of marketing is
02:10 - your trailer this will likely be the
02:12 - main thing that sells or turns off
02:14 - players to your game it will also be the
02:16 - main thing that press sites will embed
02:18 - in their articles for a good trailer the
02:20 - best approach is to keep it brief
02:22 - so usually 60 to 90 seconds going
02:25 - shorter than that won't likely not be
02:26 - enough time to showcase your features
02:28 - and going longer you risk losing the
02:30 - interest of your viewers get right to
02:33 - the action and try to hook the viewer in
02:35 - the first 10
02:36 - seconds so that means definitely don't
02:38 - spend 30 seconds showcasing your studio
02:40 - over the content for the trailer won't
02:43 - obviously depend on the genre music is
02:46 - extremely important for taking the
02:47 - trailer to another level so if you have
02:50 - an action game it should be very fast
02:52 - paced and clearly sound the feeling of
02:53 - playing the game whereas if you have a
02:56 - management Tycoon game then you should
02:58 - show just how complex and expensive the
03:00 - player can build either way you need to
03:02 - quickly hook the player on what is
03:04 - unique about your game remember there
03:06 - are hundreds of games coming out every
03:08 - month so why should a play your stick
03:10 - with your game instead of just going to
03:12 - the next one after the trailer comes
03:14 - these screenshots usually stick to a
03:16 - small number of good screenshots so
03:18 - someone like five or six make sure they
03:21 - showcase different parts of your game
03:22 - and make sure you have the UI disabled
03:25 - when taking them steam also requires the
03:27 - screenshots to feature just gameplay so
03:29 - avoid adding extra elements then you
03:32 - have steam tags which are an excellent
03:34 - way to increase this cover ability you
03:36 - should add popular but accurate tags to
03:39 - your game anyone can add tags but as a
03:41 - developer you have extra power in the
03:43 - tags that you add so choose them wisely
03:45 - the tags help steam classifier game
03:48 - which will help choose where the game
03:49 - will appear on various places in the
03:51 - store here the more games list showcases
03:54 - similar games so your game might show up
03:56 - on other games with similar tags here on
03:59 - these team recommendations you can see
04:01 - it recommends a certain game because you
04:03 - played something similar and each tag
04:05 - has its own page where you can see the
04:06 - new releases was hot discounts and so on
04:09 - some of the tags are hyper competitive
04:11 - like the Indy tag so chances are you
04:13 - won't be able to really send out on that
04:15 - one so go for more niche tags that
04:17 - accurately describe your game here my
04:20 - game Baron rata kun is on the new and
04:22 - training for the management tag so again
04:24 - tags are very important very powerful
04:26 - and you have extra power so choose your
04:29 - five tags why isn't something very
04:31 - important for one Jian seam are these
04:33 - team features some people won't
04:35 - absolutely not touch a game if it does
04:37 - not have achievements so make sure you
04:39 - implement as many same features as you
04:41 - can the permutation is very simple and
04:44 - you can use the free Steamworks net
04:46 - wrapper in unity
04:47 - so add achievements to your game then
04:50 - also add as many other features as you
04:52 - can
04:52 - stats and leaderboards are very easy to
04:55 - implement then you have Steam Cloud
04:57 - which you should use to store save files
04:59 - and options and finally trading cards
05:02 - this one depends if your game is allowed
05:04 - or not I believe right now any game must
05:06 - reach a certain threshold before it can
05:08 - add cards so you might not be able to do
05:10 - it right at much however when you can do
05:13 - add them since there are a lot of people
05:14 - who really care about cards and I think
05:17 - them will help ensure a nice long tail
05:19 - if this is your very first steam game
05:21 - then try to allow for a nice amount of
05:23 - time to research and implement all these
05:25 - features another steam feature that
05:28 - might be extremely important depending
05:29 - on your game is the workshop there are
05:31 - some games that live and breathe based
05:33 - on the workshop and others that no one
05:35 - really touches it regardless of how
05:37 - suitable your game is it always helps to
05:39 - add it so think about what you have in
05:41 - your game that can be customized for
05:43 - example maybe you have some characters
05:45 - and you can customize the sprite maybe
05:47 - have some weapons where we can modify
05:48 - their stats or maybe you can go really
05:51 - hard and make some sort of Lua scripting
05:53 - mods to allow for really complex logic
05:55 - like custom quests
05:56 - howdy PU and the workshop is up to you
05:59 - also depending on how complex it is you
06:02 - may need to add some instructions
06:04 - creating an official guide is a great
06:06 - way to do it then when you have decided
06:08 - what types of items you want to allow
06:10 - it's time to add some of your own to the
06:12 - workshop that way when the game comes
06:14 - out there on read some items for people
06:16 - to play around and here's a bonus tip in
06:19 - my games I like to highlight certain
06:21 - items and showcase them in-game here it
06:23 - is in the corner this is the workshop
06:25 - showcase the way it works is it grabs
06:28 - the items added to this collection and
06:30 - displays them in-game this is a great
06:32 - way of showing in-game what other people
06:35 - have created something you can do on
06:37 - Steam is create a dedicated developer
06:40 - page this is a place where you can list
06:42 - all your games and sort them in
06:43 - collections you can also post
06:45 - announcements and people can follow you
06:47 - as a developer if this is your first
06:50 - game then you don't have much to put
06:52 - there but make sure the page is set up
06:53 - if players like your game they might
06:56 - fall in the developer page which won't
06:58 - allow you to post announcements when
07:00 - your next game if you get enough fans
07:02 - that is a really good way of making
07:03 - subsequent releases much easier one of
07:06 - the best ways of reaching a larger
07:08 - audience is simply in localization
07:10 - whether this is easy or hard will depend
07:13 - on how you built your game if you have a
07:15 - lot of hard-coded strings and text in
07:17 - images this will be very hard or
07:19 - impossible however if you built your
07:21 - game once thinking about and later
07:23 - adding a localization then this task
07:25 - won't be very simple as you are making
07:27 - the game make sure every where you use
07:29 - the string you grab it from a class if
07:32 - you do it like that then all you need to
07:33 - do is get the translations and ammo
07:35 - localization logic to that class here is
07:38 - how I set up the in localization for my
07:40 - games anywhere I need some text I just
07:43 - call this function with nano to identify
07:45 - the string and then here it's simply the
07:47 - switch and grabs the string based on the
07:49 - active language so as you're building
07:52 - your game keep localization in mind you
07:55 - can double or triple your sales by
07:56 - simply supporting more languages than
07:58 - just English then you have unity
08:01 - analytics and cloud diagnostics this one
08:04 - won't be extremely useful when the game
08:06 - is finally out analytics won't depend on
08:09 - what kind of game you're making whether
08:11 - it's incredibly useful or simply nice to
08:13 - have if your game is free-to-play then
08:15 - using analytics to ensure people don't
08:17 - drop out is a necessity
08:19 - however for pig games they are also
08:21 - useful but less so since your goal is to
08:23 - ensure the player has fun rather than
08:24 - increase retention what is extremely
08:27 - important is cloud diagnostics if you've
08:30 - never used it this is a wonderful unity
08:32 - feature it allows you to track crashes
08:34 - and errors through the Unity dashboard
08:36 - no matter how much you test your game
08:38 - before launch you can guarantee that
08:39 - other people won't find bugs and those
08:42 - people won't always be able to send your
08:44 - logs and save funds so call Diagnostics
08:46 - is a godsend since you can see what
08:48 - issues are happening with other people
08:50 - playing your game this will help you
08:52 - understand what the issue might be and
08:54 - how to fix it without having to depend
08:56 - on someone sending you there are a lot
08:58 - fun
08:59 - so by now your game should be completely
09:01 - stable when you play on your own machine
09:03 - you should find no bugs no issues or
09:05 - anything wrong however do remember that
09:08 - the second game goes on I won't seem you
09:10 - won't have
09:10 - hopefully thousands of people playing
09:12 - your game that also means thousands of
09:14 - different configurations and you need to
09:16 - make sure your game works on all of them
09:18 - so use application that target framerate
09:21 - to limit the framerate of your game and
09:23 - make sure it is still fully playable at
09:25 - 10 frames per second the logic in your
09:28 - game should not be dependent on
09:29 - framerate since you want even people
09:31 - with very low NPCs to be able to play
09:33 - also make sure you've only test your
09:36 - game in all kinds of resolutions unity
09:38 - allows you to change the aspect ratio so
09:41 - make sure your game plays normally in
09:42 - sixteen by nine as well as five by four
09:45 - this means only your UI should be set up
09:48 - correctly and anchored to the corpse if
09:51 - you just anchor everything to the center
09:52 - then you'll have a lot of issues with
09:54 - smaller more square resolutions then add
09:57 - some safety error messages that should
09:59 - be visible in case something goes wrong
10:01 - particularly when loading here in my
10:04 - game you can see this window with this
10:05 - text this is shown right at the
10:07 - beginning of the first frame and hidden
10:09 - right at the end of that first frame
10:11 - meaning that if everything goes well
10:13 - this is hidden and the player never sees
10:15 - it but if something goes wrong during
10:17 - loading and the high code doesn't run
10:19 - the message is shown this helps the
10:21 - player knows something went wrong and
10:22 - how to contact me to fix it without this
10:25 - message the player would simply be lost
10:27 - also if you added localization make sure
10:30 - all of the languages work personally the
10:32 - way I test this is to make the script
10:33 - that changes the language every second
10:35 - and simply play the game like that you
10:37 - should see all the text object correctly
10:39 - change language and if you're supporting
10:41 - languages with special characters like
10:44 - Chinese or Korean then this is the time
10:46 - to test if your font correctly displays
10:48 - everything then some more miscellaneous
10:51 - things one thing I always included in my
10:54 - games is a change alone this is just a
10:56 - simple text file that I store in the
10:58 - game folder
10:59 - it contains each version the date and
11:01 - what changed I also post the same
11:03 - information on a pin thread on the forms
11:05 - also something specific to my games is
11:08 - the two widgets that are always add to
11:10 - the main menu then here is the carousel
11:12 - just showing all my other games
11:15 - this list is grabbed from my website so
11:17 - before I launch a new game I add it to
11:19 - that list that way all my other games
11:21 - also show the update and list and
11:24 - here is the mailing list widget growing
11:27 - a newsletter is very important in order
11:28 - to find success as a game developer and
11:30 - again I just pretty much have a sign-up
11:33 - page and sign up through here both of
11:35 - these were made ages ago and they still
11:37 - work flawlessly and lastly before you
11:40 - release the game make sure you add and
11:42 - launch discount it is possible to launch
11:44 - with that discount but if you're not a
11:46 - triple-a game then it's very difficult
11:47 - to succeed in doing so so make sure you
11:50 - add a discount between ten and twenty
11:52 - percent alright so that's Z before
11:55 - release to do list you should have a
11:57 - store page that is wrong written with
11:59 - some nice animated gifts to capture the
12:01 - eye your trailer should be quick and
12:03 - leaves the player wanting more these
12:05 - screenshots should be just a handful and
12:07 - clearly communicate what the game looks
12:09 - like your steam page should have tags
12:12 - that are accurate and popular your game
12:15 - should have as many steam features as
12:16 - you can if you are at the Steam Workshop
12:18 - you should pre add some items as well as
12:21 - some instructions your build should have
12:23 - unity cloud diagnostics and analytics so
12:26 - you can debug your game when it's out
12:28 - your build should also have been fully
12:31 - tested in all kinds of education areas
12:33 - like low framerate different languages
12:35 - and different resolutions and Leslie any
12:37 - other things specific to your game or
12:39 - you as a developer so at this point
12:42 - you're ready to hit the release button
12:44 - that's a great moment so go ahead and
12:46 - just hit release and yay congratulations
12:48 - you have just published a steam iam
12:51 - awesome however as a solo developer you
12:54 - have to keep your celebration very brief
12:55 - the second the game is out there's a ton
12:57 - of work left to do so in the next video
13:00 - I will cover what you should do as soon
13:02 - as your game is out in order to ensure
13:03 - you have a successful watch if you liked
13:06 - the video subscribe to channel for more
13:08 - game dev videos and unity tutorials post
13:10 - any questions you have in the comments
13:11 - and I'll see you next time
13:15 - [Music]
