00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here this is a really quick video on
00:04 - how to add glow to your scenes in unity
00:06 - i get this question pretty much at least
00:07 - once whenever i make a video with a glow
00:09 - effect like recently i made the third
00:11 - person shooter where i added a really
00:12 - nice glow effect to make the final one
00:14 - really nicely polished adding that is
00:16 - super simple it just requires a few
00:18 - steps so let's see them in this quick
00:19 - video here's a checklist of everything
00:21 - you need to do so let's go through them
00:23 - one by one now the first thing you need
00:25 - is a shader with some emission and
00:27 - obviously you need an object so let's
00:29 - just create a new sphere
00:30 - okay now just making material for it and
00:33 - now here for the material i'm using urp
00:35 - so i'm using the default urp and lit
00:37 - shader and with this one you've got down
00:39 - here a film for the emission so if you
00:41 - click on this you can enable a mission
00:42 - and then if you want optionally you can
00:44 - use an emission map to only emit from
00:46 - certain areas but if you'll leave it as
00:47 - known then the whole object will be
00:49 - emissive so just click on the color and
00:51 - over here set to something also like for
00:53 - example in orange and then down here you
00:55 - can see you've got the red green blue
00:57 - but then also in intensity so this one
00:59 - is just how intense the color is so you
01:01 - can click on these buttons or just
01:02 - manually modify it so let's put it maybe
01:04 - something like three okay so the sphere
01:06 - has the color with some intensity it's
01:08 - got some emission but over here in the
01:09 - scene view it is still not glowing so
01:11 - the next thing that we need is post
01:13 - processing so make a new game object
01:17 - and here let's add a component and we're
01:19 - going to add a volume component then
01:21 - just make a new post processing profile
01:23 - then add the override and the effect
01:25 - that we need to add is over here the
01:26 - bloom and the two main ones that you
01:28 - need to modify here are the threshold
01:30 - and intensity so make sure the intensity
01:32 - is more than zero so this set but again
01:34 - we still don't see any glow so the next
01:37 - step is on the render pipeline object so
01:39 - if i go up here into edit project
01:41 - settings and on the graphics i'm using
01:43 - this render pipeline object again i'm
01:45 - using urp
01:46 - so on this object down here you've got
01:48 - the pipeline asset and over here under
01:49 - quality we do see a field for hdr where
01:52 - we can enable this so you need to enable
01:54 - this in order for the intensity of that
01:56 - collar to be actually used and as soon
01:58 - as you enable yep you do see some glow
02:00 - here and just in case you don't then up
02:02 - here on the scene window there's this
02:04 - little button so this enables our
02:05 - disables effects so make sure this one
02:07 - is enabled make sure post processing is
02:08 - enabled okay so with that yep we do see
02:10 - the object glowing in the scene view
02:12 - however in the game view nope still no
02:14 - glow so the next step is to go over here
02:16 - on the camera and then under rendering
02:18 - you've got a field for post processing
02:19 - and you just need to enable this so you
02:21 - do that and yep the object is now
02:23 - correctly glowing awesome all right so
02:25 - now you can play around all these
02:26 - parameters so for example on the glow
02:29 - you can set this to any color so pure
02:31 - white maybe a green maybe a blue and so
02:33 - on one quick note here emission does not
02:35 - work with black so keep that in mind you
02:37 - cannot have a black glow and then on the
02:39 - post crossing on the bloom over here you
02:41 - can modify the threshold so this is how
02:43 - intense the column needs to be in order
02:44 - for the bloom effect to be applied so
02:46 - for example i set the intensity of three
02:48 - so if i grow this above three then all
02:50 - of a sudden there's no glow because
02:51 - three is not enough to trigger the one
02:53 - effect so usually you want this one to
02:55 - be on one or if you want maybe even less
02:57 - than one to get the whole thing glowing
02:59 - so for example these stars down here if
03:00 - i put it on one they're not glowing but
03:02 - if i put on something like 0.1 then now
03:04 - pretty much everything on the scene is
03:05 - now glowing and then the intensity
03:07 - pretty much acts like a multiplier on
03:09 - things so without modifying each
03:10 - material you can modify the entire glow
03:12 - of the entire scene and also this works
03:14 - both on 3d shaders as well as sprite
03:16 - shaders so over here for example is my
03:19 - sprite online shader that i made in
03:20 - another tutorial so here is the shader
03:23 - and shadow graph
03:24 - and it simply takes the outline color
03:26 - and simply adds it on top of the other
03:28 - colors and that applies some emission
03:30 - and yep it works just like the other one
03:32 - so here is the glow effect working on a
03:34 - sprite and a 3d mesh
03:35 - alright so that's it as you can see it's
03:37 - super simple here is the checklist again
03:39 - if you have any issues make sure you
03:40 - follow all these steps so make sure you
03:43 - have emission enabled and you're using
03:44 - an emission collar other than black then
03:47 - make sure the intensity is more than
03:48 - zero after that make sure you have
03:50 - volume post processing and make sure the
03:52 - threshold and intensity are set
03:54 - correctly then on the camera make sure
03:56 - post processing is enabled and on the
03:58 - render pipeline make sure hdr is enabled
04:00 - follow those steps and your object won't
04:02 - glow alright hope that's useful check
04:05 - out these videos to learn some more
04:07 - thanks to these awesome patreon
04:08 - supporters for making these videos
04:09 - possible thank you for watching and i'll
04:12 - see you next time
