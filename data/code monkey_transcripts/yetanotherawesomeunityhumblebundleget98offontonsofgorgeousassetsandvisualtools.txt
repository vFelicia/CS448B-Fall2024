00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and here is yet another excellent Unity
00:04 - Humble Bundle there's already the
00:06 - excellent tools bundle that I launched
00:07 - last week I highly recommend that one
00:09 - regardless of whatever game you're
00:10 - working on and now we have this one all
00:12 - about art but also include some very
00:14 - interesting art tools and a bunch of
00:15 - sound effects now since this bundle is
00:18 - mainly about visuals it really depends
00:19 - on if your style matches what you're
00:21 - using for your game although since the
00:23 - bundle discount is so deep at 98 off if
00:25 - just one of these looks interesting then
00:27 - the home bundle is worth it I already
00:29 - have about half of these assets here but
00:31 - since the discount is so deep I'm just
00:32 - going to pick it up for the rest there's
00:34 - some really interesting tones here so
00:36 - let's take a quick look at everything
00:37 - included starting off over here with
00:39 - quibly enemy shaders and tools this one
00:42 - looks pretty great I've had it for quite
00:44 - some time and I've been meaningful look
00:45 - into it if your game has an anime sound
00:48 - shade unlock then this one is excellent
00:49 - It's a collection of shaders and a bunch
00:52 - of tools to make foliage and power lines
00:54 - for me I really like the associated look
00:56 - so maybe now is the time for me to
00:58 - finally dive deep into this one then we
01:00 - have polygon dungeons this one is made
01:03 - by cinti with their signature style this
01:05 - one is a pack with over 700 objects all
01:07 - to create dungeons it includes tons of
01:09 - modular Parts as well as 16 characters
01:11 - so this one looks great for making any
01:13 - kind of Dungeon Crawler game one thing
01:15 - that I would love to experiment would be
01:17 - using these in the assets with the
01:19 - equivalent enemy shaders I think that
01:20 - could make for a really interesting look
01:22 - then we have the tonal music collection
01:25 - this one includes over 800 tracks some
01:28 - are perfect Loops some are short and
01:29 - some are alternative versions if you
01:31 - don't have any collections of music then
01:33 - a pack like this one can be extremely
01:34 - useful then over here we've got a
01:36 - monsters pack the more interesting part
01:38 - about this one is that it includes
01:40 - Evolutions so you've got one Sage
01:42 - another one and another one so if you've
01:43 - ever wanted to make your own Pokemon
01:45 - type game then this pack would be a
01:47 - great starting point after that we have
01:49 - yet another sound pack this one is also
01:51 - massive almost 10 000 sound effects so
01:54 - again just a great General impact to
01:55 - have then for a very realistic Forest
01:58 - environment this one is super detail
02:00 - you've got lots of trees grass a bunch
02:02 - of flowers ground textures and some more
02:04 - everything looks really nice really
02:06 - realistic then it's an interesting tool
02:08 - for helping you make your characters
02:09 - bounce so this one is pretty great for
02:12 - making your characters and objects a
02:13 - little quite a bit more jiggly so this
02:15 - looks like an excellent tool to have
02:17 - that extra bit of punish to your game
02:18 - then if you want a force environment but
02:20 - this time in a cartoony sound look at
02:22 - this one I think this one looks really
02:24 - great really awesome really calming
02:26 - everything looks gorgeous so I'm looking
02:29 - at this one definitely makes me want to
02:30 - use this demo scene in some kind of
02:32 - feature tutorial environment after that
02:34 - is another interesting tool to make your
02:36 - game visually unique this one takes your
02:38 - regular 3D objects and makes them look
02:40 - like pixel art you've gotten lots of
02:42 - parameters to control the amount of
02:44 - pixelization the outline color lights
02:46 - and a bunch more the end result
02:48 - definitely makes it for a very
02:49 - interesting look now this one is a
02:51 - real-time post Crossing effect so it's a
02:53 - bit different from another similar tool
02:55 - that we're going to see in a bit then
02:57 - over here we have some realistic forest
02:59 - animals these are super high quality
03:01 - both models and textures so I could see
03:03 - this pack being quite useful for some
03:05 - kind of hunting game then we have a
03:07 - party monster pack this one is very
03:09 - colorful so would be great for making a
03:12 - game kind of like fun guys they have
03:14 - customizable body parts and weapons so
03:16 - you can create infinite variation up
03:18 - next is a very realistic very high
03:20 - quality Temple this one looks extremely
03:22 - nice really gorgeous assets
03:24 - everything is really nice and modular so
03:27 - if your game is inspired by Tomb Raider
03:29 - or uncharten then this would be the
03:30 - perfect pack then we have two packs with
03:33 - cute animals featuring a very cute art
03:36 - style and also including animations both
03:38 - packs have 90 animals so this one would
03:40 - be great if you're making some kind of
03:42 - zoo tycoon game if your game has any
03:44 - underwater sections then this one can be
03:46 - very harmful
03:47 - making an underwater scene look like
03:49 - it's actually underwater it's actually
03:51 - pretty complex so an effect like this
03:52 - one can definitely save you a ton of
03:54 - time and as you can see it looks great
03:55 - after that we have another sound spec
03:57 - this one is all about monsters it
03:59 - includes many creature sounds so it has
04:01 - zombies insects ghosts demons Orcs and a
04:04 - bunch more then the character created 2D
04:07 - it's a pretty nice sound on the
04:08 - characters it's a 2d very clean art
04:10 - sound of the body parts are separated
04:13 - for some easy animation so with this
04:15 - level of customization you could
04:16 - definitely use this pack for all your
04:18 - characters then we have another tool
04:20 - this one is magical cloth this is
04:22 - another one that I've seen many many
04:23 - times on the SSR but never only looked
04:25 - into it basically allows you to add
04:27 - physics simulation to a bunch of objects
04:29 - now obviously that's great for cloth but
04:31 - also for hair maybe a tail really works
04:34 - on anything that drapes down then over
04:36 - here a bit of a strange one strange
04:39 - because the scales over here you have
04:40 - thousands of footsteps sound effects I
04:43 - have no idea how it's possible to have
04:44 - over a thousand sounds for surfaces no
04:46 - kinds of ways to step on it but
04:48 - apparently here it is next is the basic
04:50 - motions pack now I really like this one
04:53 - I've used it in a few videos including
04:55 - one that I recorded just a while ago
04:57 - it's a bunch of generic motions so they
04:59 - are useful for pretty much any project
05:00 - of course you have basic movement but
05:03 - then also some more unique things you've
05:05 - got some talking animations some sitting
05:07 - animations you've got a victory hand
05:10 - wave looting something and a bunch more
05:12 - so this one is definitely a great pack
05:13 - to use in all your prototypes next up is
05:16 - the birds pack they've got a really nice
05:18 - very realistic art style they all have
05:21 - animations included so this would be a
05:23 - great pack to add a bit more in life to
05:24 - your world next up here we have some
05:26 - cute dragons these remind me of
05:28 - Skylanders or I guess maybe just spiral
05:30 - definitely a very cute art song with
05:32 - tons of animations then is the other
05:34 - pixelated I mentioned a while ago now
05:37 - the difference is the other one is a
05:39 - post-processing effect whereas this one
05:40 - takes a character and an animation and
05:42 - generates a Sprite sheet so the end
05:44 - result is a pure to the character and
05:46 - they also mentioned they have a custom
05:48 - 2D Shader that makes it work with
05:49 - lighting so this is another one that I'd
05:51 - like to look into in more detail next up
05:53 - is the map graph this one is a tool for
05:55 - helping you make Town based Maps so this
05:58 - would be perfect if you're making some
05:59 - kind of old-school RPG but it also works
06:02 - with game objects and prefab so you can
06:04 - also use it to make 3D maps next up over
06:06 - here a great looking VFX bundle features
06:09 - lots of effects and all of them will
06:10 - look pretty great you've got everything
06:12 - from some basic projectiles to some
06:14 - auras you've got some defenses some aoes
06:17 - there's tons of variety then we have a
06:19 - snow and ice skater
06:21 - this one has a very interesting effect
06:23 - so this would be great if you have some
06:25 - kind of snow Vamp in your game you can
06:27 - use this to make your character's
06:28 - movement through the environment feel
06:29 - much much better and finally over here a
06:32 - simple but very useful tool this one
06:34 - helps you take a texture and make it
06:36 - seamless for me every time I draw a
06:38 - texture it's always a pain to make it
06:39 - seamless to copy the left side to the
06:41 - right side and so on so this simple tool
06:43 - looks definitely excellent to me alright
06:45 - so that's a bundle now some of these
06:47 - assets are only useful if it matches
06:49 - your style but actually a lot of the art
06:50 - tools encoded here would be great in
06:52 - pretty much any project so that coupled
06:55 - with the extremely deep discount at 98
06:56 - off makes this pack very unlikely worth
06:58 - it for me I already have quite a lot of
07:01 - these but I'm probably going to get it
07:02 - just to get the rest and just in case
07:04 - you missed last week's video there's
07:05 - also an excellent tune bundle going on
07:07 - these humble bundles with massive
07:09 - discounts only happen about once or
07:10 - twice per year so definitely don't miss
07:12 - out on them
07:13 - both are linked in the description and
07:14 - those are our film links so if you pick
07:16 - it up you get some awesome tools and
07:17 - assets and I get a nice commission
