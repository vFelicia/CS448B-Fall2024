00:02 - here on quick video here so I've been
00:05 - running this channel for over 20 months
00:07 - now in all that time I've made over 250
00:09 - videos covering all sorts of topics from
00:11 - beginner to advanced this has been a
00:13 - very interesting journey I really enjoy
00:15 - making these videos and sharing my
00:16 - knowledge and reception has been great
00:18 - so first of all thank you for following
00:20 - the channel and I hope you've learned a
00:21 - ton from all those videos now I've got
00:24 - lots of topics that I still want to
00:25 - cover and I want to keep making free
00:27 - videos for as long as possible to do
00:29 - that I need your help so if these videos
00:32 - have helped you if you found them
00:33 - valuable and if you can afford it then
00:36 - you can now directly support the channel
00:37 - on patreon I've been running this
00:39 - channel by burning through my savings
00:41 - but in order for me to continue doing
00:43 - this in the long term then at some point
00:44 - it needs to become sustainable but again
00:47 - I also want it to be optional so first
00:49 - of all if you simply cannot afford it
00:51 - then that is perfectly fine the videos
00:53 - won't continue for as long as I can and
00:55 - will always be free I've actually been
00:57 - thinking about this for a couple of
00:58 - months now when I started making these
01:00 - videos something that I felt very
01:02 - strongly about was how I wanted to give
01:04 - as much as I can for free especially the
01:06 - project files in utilities my main goal
01:08 - has always been to help you by sharing
01:10 - acknowledge I've accumulated over the
01:12 - many years I've been making games and I
01:14 - wanted to make it available for everyone
01:15 - that's why I started making free videos
01:17 - instead of paid courses so I really want
01:21 - to keep providing tons of free content
01:22 - for everyone to learn from but at the
01:24 - same time I need this to become
01:26 - sustainable and I want the people who
01:27 - support on patreon to feel like they're
01:29 - getting something so in thinking long
01:32 - and hard about that problem the solution
01:33 - I've come up with is simply one-week
01:35 - exclusive project fallacy whenever a new
01:38 - video comes out the project files will
01:39 - be exclusive to patreon for one week for
01:42 - just five bucks you will greatly support
01:44 - the channel and get the project files as
01:46 - soon as the video is out but if you
01:48 - can't afford this then you can still
01:50 - follow along with the video or just wait
01:51 - one week and the adi project files again
01:54 - i've been thinking about this for a very
01:56 - long time and i believe this approach
01:57 - makes it great for everyone if you
01:59 - really find the videos helpful and
02:01 - valuable then for just 5 bucks you'll be
02:03 - helping the channel a ton and get
02:05 - everything as soon as the videos come
02:06 - out if you come across one of my older
02:09 - videos then everything is free as it's
02:10 - always been any fee just simply cannot
02:13 - afford it then you can still get
02:14 - everything by waiting at most one week
02:16 - so that's the basics of how patreon is
02:19 - set up there's a bunch more tiers
02:21 - like if you want to use AdMob but not
02:23 - feeling bad about it you can just
02:24 - support at the two dollar level which
02:26 - already helps more than by watching a
02:28 - thousand ads or if you have a game
02:30 - yourself and you want to promote it in a
02:31 - video you can support that that tier and
02:34 - also if you're uncomfortable with a
02:36 - monthly payment you can still support
02:37 - the channel with a single payment by
02:39 - picking up the game bundle you'll be
02:41 - helping the channel and get some cool
02:42 - games for you to play with your support
02:45 - I can also attempt some logic projects
02:47 - if I know I'm not as dependent on ad
02:48 - views and having to massively grow the
02:50 - channel I have a lot of ideas that take
02:52 - time to make like complete games from
02:54 - start to finish a complete c-sharp
02:56 - course Q&A doing reviews of your games
02:58 - doing a game jam with modular elements
03:01 - weekly challenges and more there's tons
03:03 - of cool ideas I can make that don't
03:05 - really work with the ad model but with
03:07 - your support I can try them out and you
03:09 - can benefit from more interesting in
03:10 - that videos so again if you found the
03:13 - videos helpful and valuable and you want
03:15 - to help keep them coming and keep them
03:17 - free for everyone forever then check out
03:19 - the patreon page as always thank you so
03:21 - much for watching thank you for your
03:23 - support and I'll see you next time
