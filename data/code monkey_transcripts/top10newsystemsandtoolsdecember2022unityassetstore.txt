00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the asosaurus full of awesome tools and
00:04 - asks to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - December 22. this month was actually a
00:12 - bit difficult to pick 10 tools I guess
00:14 - it was because of Black Friday not many
00:16 - people wanted to launch new interesting
00:17 - Tunes during this time but still I found
00:20 - a handful of interesting ones this one
00:22 - is only self-paid systems and tools in
00:24 - the last video I already covered the
00:25 - best three new assets and in the next
00:27 - one I'll be covering top ads and effects
00:29 - as always there's links to the US in the
00:31 - description and as a bonus you can use a
00:32 - coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your
00:34 - order also here's some excellent news D2
00:37 - best bundles that I've ever seen that
00:39 - happened a couple of months ago they are
00:40 - back for the holidays there is an
00:42 - excellent tools bundle with all kinds of
00:44 - systems and tools so you've got an
00:45 - engine for making a top-down shooter a
00:47 - tool for setting up some light probes
00:48 - you can set up some weather effects set
00:51 - up some 2D lights a better UI and some
00:53 - really awesome fluid animations so lots
00:56 - of excellent tools on this one and then
00:58 - here is the excellent Earth bundle with
00:59 - tons of visuals and some interesting
01:01 - shaders this one has quite a lot of
01:03 - variety quite a lot of things for
01:04 - example here you have quimly this is an
01:06 - excellent cartoony Shader then a real
01:09 - nice Indie pack a whole bunch of music
01:10 - tons and tons of sound effects you've
01:13 - got some more Shader effects so to
01:15 - pixelize them which looks really
01:16 - interesting we've got some fantasy
01:18 - nature a realistic template a bunch of
01:21 - cute animals tons more animations a
01:23 - bunch of effects and a bunch more so if
01:25 - you've missed these two bundles when
01:26 - they first happened a few months ago
01:27 - then I highly highly recommend you give
01:29 - them a look with the insane 98 off
01:31 - discount the entire bundle is worth it
01:33 - just for a single tool or acid and of
01:35 - course esinte cell is also still
01:36 - happening so you feel like their pack
01:38 - included in that button only you can
01:40 - check out the sale to see everything
01:41 - they do alright so starting off with a
01:43 - nice first person Prototype game engine
01:45 - you just hit play and you already have a
01:48 - really nice character controller with
01:49 - all kinds of unique abilities so things
01:51 - like a hook shot won't run slide
01:53 - projectiles and a bunch more basically
01:55 - if you'd like to build a game similar to
01:57 - Denny's Carlson then this is a great way
01:59 - of quickly getting started it includes
02:01 - many scripts with lots of parameters you
02:03 - can tweak so if you have some kind of
02:05 - first person Parkour game idea then this
02:07 - can help you quickly prototype it next
02:09 - up if you'd like to do character
02:11 - customization here's a tool to do that
02:13 - this one is specifically built with the
02:15 - synthes in mind chances are you already
02:17 - own a bunch of those packs
02:19 - apparently you can just import the
02:21 - supported City packs and it
02:22 - automatically unloads them then you can
02:24 - easily customize tons of things on the
02:26 - characters to get near endless variation
02:28 - you can save the new prefab and easily
02:30 - use it just like you would use any other
02:32 - character so this one looks like a
02:34 - pretty nice tune if you already have
02:36 - tons of Cindy packs and you'll like to
02:37 - create some custom characters next up
02:40 - here is a look script basically it has
02:42 - some ik to help you make your character
02:44 - look where you want it to
02:46 - it works on top of your regular
02:48 - animations so you can Aim Shoot and
02:50 - reload it's also not just about weapons
02:53 - so it also works with hands for some
02:55 - kind of melee Focus game it's got a
02:57 - simple setup so if only one is to make
02:59 - your character then picking up this
03:01 - simultane can be quite helpful
03:03 - then here's an interesting one it's a
03:05 - tool for baking ambient illusion
03:07 - directly into your vertex data this film
03:09 - can be useful for low end devices where
03:12 - running ambient occlusion in real time
03:13 - would be too costly you just run this
03:16 - once you bake the AO directly into the
03:18 - mesh and you just use it at runtime
03:20 - since the effect is stored on the vertex
03:22 - data it won't depend on how many
03:23 - vertices your mesh has four low poly
03:26 - meshes this dev has another tool that
03:28 - does the same thing but makes the
03:29 - resolution onto a texturing set
03:31 - next up here's a fun interesting one
03:33 - it's a QR slash Barcode Scanner and
03:36 - Generator so you can easily generate
03:38 - some valid codes with whatever that you
03:40 - want then you can use the camera to
03:42 - easily scan them and get the data back
03:44 - so this could be fun if you have some
03:47 - sort of game idea that you want to exist
03:49 - both in the real world and in the
03:51 - virtual world so maybe a game where you
03:52 - can scan some physical objects to get
03:54 - some kind of bonus in the digital game
03:56 - so could be fun then here we have a 3D
03:59 - pathfinding tool one thing that is
04:01 - always tricky is handling 3D pathfinding
04:03 - for some flying enemies making
04:05 - pathfinding just in the floors is pretty
04:07 - easy but in the air it's a bit more
04:08 - complex for example the built-in Unity
04:10 - navmash does not support that it can
04:12 - only generate multiple levels on the
04:14 - floor
04:15 - whereas with this you can easily Define
04:17 - an entire 3D area as wonkable or rather
04:19 - flyable and it automatically generates
04:22 - all of the valid positions then you can
04:24 - just feed it a Target point and it
04:25 - calculates the path to get there in the
04:27 - entire 3D space so if you're having
04:29 - trouble with some flying enemies and
04:31 - pathfinding then maybe a tune like this
04:32 - one can be helpful next up if you want
04:35 - to add some more life to your shooting
04:36 - look at this Zone
04:38 - it helps you add Dynamic recoil to your
04:40 - weapons making it Dynamic can help make
04:42 - it feel a bit more natural than just
04:44 - repeating the same animation over and
04:46 - over again
04:47 - it makes a weapon Shake on shoot and
04:49 - keeps the hands in the same position so
04:51 - this one is another simple tool you can
04:53 - use to add a little bit of extra polish
04:55 - to your game then for something a bit
04:57 - more Niche here's the tool to convert
04:59 - from CSV onto a scriptable object this
05:01 - one does exactly what you expect you
05:03 - give it a CSV with whatever that you
05:05 - want and it automatically reads that
05:07 - data onto a scriptable object pretty
05:09 - simple and does examine what you want
05:10 - next for something a bit more
05:12 - interesting here is a noise generated
05:14 - tool you can play around with tons of
05:16 - parameters to generate some noise
05:17 - there's some like 20 noise types to
05:19 - choose from you can even stack multiple
05:22 - modules on top of one another to get
05:23 - some really interesting results and then
05:25 - when you have the final result that
05:27 - you're happy with you can easily
05:28 - generate the final texture either in
05:30 - grayscale or in phone color then you can
05:32 - use a texture in whatever way you want
05:34 - for example it could be a Terrain height
05:36 - map could be a wind map could be some
05:38 - dissolved noise and so on one example of
05:40 - this is the video where I cover the
05:41 - transition effect in Hades that one is a
05:43 - simple Shader just using a nice
05:45 - interesting texture so this is the kind
05:47 - of thing you could use for that and then
05:49 - here we have a tool for helping you
05:50 - manage multiple surface types you can
05:53 - play different sounds handle impacts on
05:55 - a per surface basis and a bunch more
05:57 - this one works pretty simple to add you
05:59 - just add a component choose the surface
06:00 - type and that's it alright so those are
06:03 - my top 10 new tones and systems on the
06:05 - unity s store for December 22 there's
06:07 - links to all the description and as a
06:08 - bonus you can use the coupon code monkey
