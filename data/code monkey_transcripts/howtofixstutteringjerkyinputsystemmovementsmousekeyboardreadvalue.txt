00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - here's a super quick video on how to fix
00:04 - an issue that i've had many people
00:05 - mention but i could never figure that
00:07 - out because it never actually happened
00:08 - to me that is until now
00:10 - basically the camera and the player
00:12 - movement is very jerky and inconsistent
00:14 - it has to do with the official star
00:16 - assets which i covered in another video
00:18 - however the issue is with the input
00:19 - system and not those specific assets
00:21 - unity has those official first and third
00:23 - person assets i also use them in the
00:25 - third person shooter controller and the
00:27 - third person aiming controller in those
00:29 - i use the third person controller and i
00:31 - never encountered the issue
00:33 - but lately i've been working with the
00:34 - first person controller to make some
00:36 - first person tutorial videos and
00:37 - especially with this one i can
00:38 - definitely find the error it causes some
00:40 - weird jittery movement as i move the
00:42 - mouse really quickly you can see that
00:44 - the game object stops randomly i'm
00:46 - constantly moving the mouse and yet
00:47 - sometimes it just randomly stops moving
00:49 - the same thing with the actual character
00:51 - movement sometimes it just stops moving
00:53 - for a few frames
00:54 - now i never encountered this issue with
00:56 - the third person controller but with the
00:58 - first person one it seems to happen
00:59 - constantly thankfully the effects for
01:01 - this is super simple
01:03 - since it happens with both the camera
01:05 - rotation and the player movement it
01:06 - means that the issue is not really with
01:08 - the character code but rather with the
01:09 - input system here the code for this
01:11 - controller is accessing the input system
01:13 - and calling read value to read both the
01:15 - movement and the mouse value and
01:17 - importantly this one is being called on
01:19 - every update
01:20 - if i add a debug.log we can see that
01:22 - even though i'm constantly moving the
01:24 - mouse sometimes it still returns 0 0.
01:27 - again this is being called on every
01:28 - update and the issue is that by default
01:31 - the input system does not actually
01:32 - update on every update by default it
01:34 - works on fixed update which usually runs
01:36 - less often than the regular update the
01:39 - solution is to go into edit and then
01:40 - project settings
01:42 - then go down into the input system
01:44 - package
01:45 - and over here the very first one is the
01:47 - update mode and as you can see by
01:48 - default it says process events in the
01:50 - fixed update but if we click we can see
01:52 - the other options one of them is
01:54 - manually so you can tell the input
01:56 - system manually when you want it to
01:58 - update and the other one is press events
02:00 - on the dynamic update so if you select
02:03 - this one and then we try it again
02:05 - now even as i'm moving the mouse super
02:06 - quickly everything is still nice and
02:08 - smooth same thing with the movement it
02:10 - never stops and looking in the console
02:12 - it's constantly reading some values so
02:14 - it never reads zero zero so now there's
02:16 - no jittery or jerky movement anywhere on
02:18 - every single frame the input system is
02:20 - pulling the input in order to read the
02:22 - input values and correctly use them okay
02:24 - so that's really the super simple
02:26 - effects just change when the input
02:27 - system updates so if you're one of the
02:29 - people who had this issue with my third
02:31 - person shooter controller then hopefully
02:33 - this video helps
02:34 - or if you're just using the input system
02:35 - in general then now you know one
02:37 - specific thing about how that system
02:38 - works and if you're seeing some weird
02:40 - behavior then hopefully this video will
02:42 - show up on the search result now that i
02:44 - have this issue fixed and the first
02:45 - person controller is working correctly
02:47 - stay tuned for some really interesting
02:48 - first person tutorial videos
02:50 - alright hope that's useful check out
02:52 - these videos to learn some more thanks
02:54 - to these awesome patreon supporters for
02:55 - making these videos possible thank you
