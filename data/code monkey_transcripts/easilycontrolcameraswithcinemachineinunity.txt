00:00 - this video is sponsored by unity in this
00:02 - video we're going to look at sin machine
00:04 - and unity this is an excellent feature
00:06 - that lets you easily control your
00:07 - cameras with tons of options same
00:09 - machine is great for gameplay and also
00:11 - to handle cutscenes let's begin
00:16 - [Music]
00:20 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:22 - and this channel is all about helping
00:24 - you learn how to make your own games
00:25 - with enough tutorials made by a
00:27 - professional indie game developer so if
00:29 - you find the video helpful consider
00:30 - subscribing
00:31 - ok so sin machine is a camera system
00:34 - that gives anyone working with cameras
00:36 - the ability to create complex behaviors
00:38 - without having to write any code so if
00:40 - you're an artist designer or just
00:42 - someone who wants to make a short film
00:44 - inside of unity then sin machine is
00:46 - exactly what you need here we're going
00:48 - to look at how sin machine helps us very
00:50 - easily set a target for a camera to look
00:52 - and thought play around with valleys to
00:55 - make our camera work exactly as we want
00:57 - it set up multiple cameras and smoothly
00:59 - interpolate between them and in the end
01:01 - I will also showcase house in Maschine
01:03 - also works in TD now this video is an
01:06 - interesting one what I'm going to do

02:11 - free for everyone ok so as I was saying
02:14 - sin machine is all about making complex
02:15 - camera movements simple sin machine does
02:18 - not replace your normal cameras but
02:19 - rather it works on top of them so you
02:22 - have a brain and a bunch of virtual
02:24 - cameras then those virtual cameras can
02:26 - be animated move around and do anything
02:28 - you want you can make them follow an
02:30 - object look at something
02:32 - cut or plane between different virtual
02:34 - cameras the brain processes on that data
02:37 - and creates the final shot here I will
02:39 - demonstrate sin machine mainly working
02:41 - in 3d but everything works exactly the
02:43 - same in 2d as well all right so let's
02:46 - start using it so over here I am in a
02:49 - basic scene over here I have my basic
02:52 - player character and I can move them
02:54 - around this nice small map and as you
02:56 - can see the camera right now is on a
02:58 - commune affixed position I cover this
03:01 - character controller in a previous video
03:03 - all I did was change the Y movement for
03:06 - a set movement and just like that now
03:07 - this character is moving in 3d so we
03:10 - have a nice demo scene now let's use sin
03:13 - machine first of all we need to add it
03:15 - to our project so open up the package
03:17 - manager then scroll down until you find
03:19 - the same machine and click on import
03:22 - just like that sin machine is now added
03:24 - onto the project you can confirm that it
03:27 - was in some correctly by checking all
03:29 - the way up here that there's a new sin
03:30 - machine many all right so with sin
03:33 - machine and sound let's start adding the
03:35 - main component which is the brain the
03:37 - brain is the component that acts as the
03:39 - main hub for all of the other sin
03:41 - machine components so it takes control
03:43 - of the camera and then allows you to
03:45 - work with various in machine virtual
03:46 - cameras so let's select our main camera
03:50 - and then we're going to add a component
03:52 - and then here we go into sin machine and
03:54 - add the same machine brain there's the
03:57 - brain component and as you can see
03:59 - there's tons of option to customize it
04:00 - the exactly how you want it but for now
04:03 - let's leave everything at the defaults
04:04 - and now that we have our brain we need a
04:07 - virtual camera the virtual camera is
04:09 - what actually defines the behavior of
04:10 - our camera so let's go up into our menu
04:13 - bar so click on sin machine and then in
04:17 - here create a virtual camera once you do
04:20 - you can see a new game object has been
04:21 - created in the hierarchy and if we
04:23 - inspect it we can see that it has a sin
04:25 - machine virtual camera component now
04:27 - over here as you can see we have tons of
04:29 - options now if you've ever manually
04:32 - worked with cameras then you know how
04:34 - it's quite a bit tricky to get them to
04:35 - simply follow and look at an object in
04:38 - here all we have to do is set these two
04:40 - fields so over here I have my character
04:43 - in my scene and I want this virtual
04:45 - camera to
04:45 - looking at it so to do that just drag
04:48 - the character controller onto the own
04:49 - look at field and just like that you can
04:52 - see that our virtual camera immediately
04:54 - snaps onto our target object and just
04:57 - like this if we try to play our scene
04:58 - and if there it is the camera is
05:00 - pointing towards my character and as I
05:02 - move around the camera correctly tracks
05:04 - my character all right so here you can
05:07 - see by just setting a simple field we
05:10 - have our camera correctly tracking a
05:11 - special object now over here the virtual
05:15 - camera has tons of options that you can
05:17 - play around it for example over here we
05:20 - can click on the aim tab in order to
05:22 - expand it and here we can play around
05:24 - with any of these values now the main
05:26 - thing is the ability to add a dead zone
05:28 - and a soft zone so down here we have the
05:31 - dead zone width and the South Zone width
05:33 - and height
05:34 - visually we can see some nice home from
05:36 - all gizmos so as I increase the dead
05:38 - zone width and increase the height and
05:40 - there you go you can see a little
05:42 - rectangle right in there so there's an
05:44 - air right down the middle then one
05:46 - outside of here and another one way out
05:48 - here so the middle one is the dead zone
05:51 - then this one out here is the soft zone
05:53 - and then out here it will never reach so
05:56 - once our character is inside of the dead
05:58 - zone then the camera will not move at
06:00 - all so as I move my camera in there as
06:01 - long as I stay in there the camera does
06:03 - not pan does not move it does not do
06:04 - anything then outside we have the subtle
06:08 - and as soon as my character moves into
06:10 - the South Zone there you go the camera
06:12 - now moves around in order to make sure
06:13 - that it's always looking at my character
06:15 - then here we also have horizontal and
06:18 - vertical damping so right now it's
06:20 - falling pretty fast as soon as my
06:22 - character moves and if I increase it by
06:24 - quite a bit
06:25 - then all of a sudden it won't track the
06:27 - character but it don't track it much
06:28 - slower then the red area is the end of
06:31 - the soft zone which again we can still
06:33 - modify in here and that means that as
06:35 - soon as the character goes outside our
06:38 - camera won't track it instantly
06:40 - regardless of the horizontal damping so
06:42 - as I move I move away and yep there you
06:45 - go as soon as I go into the red area it
06:47 - starts flowing instantly so you can see
06:49 - how just by dragging a target game
06:51 - object and setting a few options we
06:53 - already have some pretty complex
06:55 - behavior now for here the other film
06:57 - that we have is the phone field
06:59 - and with the formal film we also have
07:01 - the button here that we can set on for
07:02 - our options so for example let's drag
07:05 - our character controller onto the phone
07:06 - field and it instantly snaps right in
07:09 - front of the character then here we have
07:12 - the follow-up set so let's put it up and
07:15 - again the camera is always pointing
07:18 - towards the character so let's put it
07:20 - and push it a bit away just like that so
07:23 - with both of these now our camera won't
07:25 - look at the target and follow it so he's
07:27 - right in there and as I move to the left
07:29 - you can see the camera Pennington left
07:30 - Pennington right moving forward and
07:33 - moving backwards for some let's slow
07:36 - down the movement speed and let's
07:39 - increase the horizontal damping on our
07:41 - look and now if we move yep there you go
07:44 - you can see that he follows and he goes
07:46 - just like that so as I move away the
07:49 - camera is rotating towards it and then
07:52 - slowly moving in order to go onto this
07:54 - perfect follow offset position so again
07:57 - here we have some pretty complex
07:58 - behavior without having to write any
08:00 - code although obviously if you wanted to
08:02 - work with some code you could still do
08:04 - it for example you could easily swap out
08:06 - the target and look at with a different
08:07 - object so you know the game is running
08:09 - let's say now I want it to point at the
08:11 - cube and there you go now it's pointing
08:12 - at the Q and following the character so
08:14 - I move the character in the character
08:15 - moves but it's looking at the Q another
08:17 - option we have is having multiple
08:19 - virtual cameras so let's put this one so
08:22 - following the main camera and now let's
08:24 - make another virtual camera so we go
08:26 - into sin machine create a virtual camera
08:34 - okay so I had the new virtual camera
08:36 - this one is just looking at from a fixed
08:38 - point with a bit of a different field of
08:40 - view and if we play so first here we are
08:43 - with our camera correctly following and
08:45 - moving along with the player and now in
08:47 - the second camera if I increase the
08:49 - priority above the first camera as I
08:51 - increase there you go it smoothly
08:53 - interpolates between both virtual
08:55 - cameras so we're here I can move my
08:57 - character now let's lower the priority
08:59 - of this one and now it goes back onto
09:02 - the other original virtual camera so the
09:05 - same machine brain is smart enough to
09:06 - interpolate all of the values between
09:08 - them so whatever camera is active it
09:11 - takes on that field
09:12 - that position where it's looking in
09:14 - everything then you can also inspect the
09:17 - brain in order to modify how the default
09:19 - point works by default it's set to ease
09:21 - in and out and it's supposed to take two
09:23 - seconds
09:24 - but you can change it to anything you
09:26 - want for example it save 21 seconds so
09:29 - it's really fast and now let's lower
09:31 - priority this one angular straight down
09:33 - straight down just like that so you see
09:35 - how you have tons of options you can
09:37 - have as many virtual cameras as you want
09:39 - all of them looking wherever you want
09:40 - doing whatever you want it's an
09:42 - extremely customizable system then over
09:45 - here on the menu you can see that there
09:47 - are lots of different virtual camera
09:49 - types there aren't built to be very easy
09:51 - to use and fulfill a very specific need
09:53 - so if you got a free look if you want to
09:55 - move around to the camera you've got
09:57 - state-driven or to play around with
09:59 - various states you got a clear shot to
10:01 - make sure that your target is always in
10:02 - view and so on then down here like I
10:05 - said scene machine also works in 2d so
10:07 - let's check this out so here I am in a
10:10 - 2d scene with my normal player character
10:12 - just moving around all I have is a basic
10:15 - static main camera and now here I just
10:17 - go into the menu send machine create a
10:19 - 2d camera as soon as you do it creates a
10:22 - virtual camera and adds the send machine
10:24 - brain onto the main camera
10:25 - so now let's position the virtual camera
10:28 - accordingly and give it a target so drag
10:30 - the camera onto the follow act and again
10:33 - over here play around the damping and so
10:35 - on and here we also have a bunch more to
10:37 - these specific features all right
10:39 - everything's set up and just run and
10:41 - okay here's my character and as I move
10:43 - it there you go now the camera is
10:45 - correctly tracking my character so you
10:48 - can see a nice virtual camera working
10:50 - perfectly in 2d and again here I can
10:56 - play around priority so here I have one
10:58 - specific camera very zoomed in then
11:01 - lower the priority and immediately
11:02 - smooth on to the other large cameras
11:05 - there we go just like this I'll go in
11:07 - zoom in and go out and zoom out all
11:09 - right so you can see how the power of
11:11 - sin machine works both in 3d and 2d all
11:14 - right so here we looked at scene machine
11:16 - in unity again this video is just the
11:19 - getting started based on the same
11:21 - machine course on unity learned premium
11:22 - the course has a lot more content diving
11:25 - deeper into this
11:25 - machine brain covering how to make a
11:27 - dolly track interacting with timeline to
11:29 - make some cool cutscenes and lots much
