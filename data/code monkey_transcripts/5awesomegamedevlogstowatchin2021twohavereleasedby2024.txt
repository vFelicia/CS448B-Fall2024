00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video let's check out some
00:04 - awesome devlogs right here on youtube
00:06 - i spent a lot of time just watching game
00:08 - dev related videos so i figured i'd
00:10 - group a bunch of them in a nice video
00:11 - since i assume a lot of you have the
00:13 - same interest as me and you might not be
00:15 - aware of some of these channels
00:16 - devlogs are always great both for
00:18 - inspiration as well as for seeing how
00:20 - other people make their games and solve
00:22 - all the usual game design questions that
00:24 - each game brings up
00:25 - there's always a lot to learn by
00:26 - watching someone else build a different
00:28 - game
00:29 - and by the way i'm not going to mention
00:30 - danny since i'm guessing all of you
00:32 - already know the channel he's working on
00:33 - carlson which looks awesome and the
00:35 - devlogs are always extremely
00:36 - entertaining
00:37 - also these are in no particular order
00:39 - all of them are very interesting and
00:40 - unique and in various stages of
00:42 - development
00:44 - [Music]
00:48 - so let's begin with the channel devduck
00:50 - working on a marine biologist rpg named
00:53 - dauphin
00:53 - you play as a marine biologist and your
00:56 - goal is to save the ocean you go through
00:57 - various islands and caves looking for
00:59 - interesting marine animals to rescue
01:01 - one unique thing is how the game does
01:03 - feature combat however you don't
01:05 - actually kill any creatures
01:07 - the whole idea is to save them so as you
01:09 - attack the animals you're not really
01:10 - damaging them but instead
01:12 - you're just clearing their corruption so
01:13 - they get back to being normal
01:15 - personally i always find cleaning things
01:17 - very compelling starting with something
01:18 - messy and ending with it per scene so i
01:20 - really like the idea of starting with a
01:22 - completely corrupted world and clearing
01:24 - it bit by bit
01:25 - you have various zones at your disposal
01:27 - there's a bunch of npcs you can talk to
01:29 - and you also have a ship which allows
01:31 - you to travel between islands
01:32 - i imagine the final game will also have
01:34 - some sort of pokemon like element as you
01:36 - discover and catalog all the creatures
01:38 - that you come across
01:39 - the dev logs have a really nice channel
01:41 - feeling very relaxing
01:42 - they are nicely filmed and edited with
01:44 - some common music and there's about 2
01:46 - per month
01:47 - the game is being developed in godot
01:49 - although it did start life as a unity
01:51 - game
01:51 - it has been in development for one year
01:53 - now and progress has been solid
01:55 - he also made a very interesting video on
01:57 - the results of his very first indie
01:59 - mobile game
02:00 - it's full of very valuable lessons
02:02 - learned as well as some financial
02:03 - results
02:04 - do remember that the definition for
02:05 - success is different for each person
02:07 - depending on what
02:08 - you value knowledge and experience can
02:09 - certainly be a lot more valuable than
02:11 - just dollars
02:12 - and he also made another very
02:14 - interesting video on how to become a
02:15 - morning person
02:16 - he mentions the benefits of having those
02:18 - hours of clear focused work or
02:20 - leisure time as well as three very
02:22 - useful tips that will definitely help
02:23 - you if you want to give it a try
02:25 - for me having a morning routine is
02:27 - absolutely essential to be able to make
02:28 - my games in these videos
02:30 - i actually made a video about a year ago
02:32 - on my 8 tips from working from home and
02:34 - having a clear routine and waking up
02:35 - was definitely one of them for me if i
02:38 - don't take advantage of those hours
02:39 - early in the morning then my
02:41 - productivity really just drops like a
02:42 - brick
02:43 - it's not for someone some people
02:45 - definitely do work much better at night
02:46 - but i would encourage you to at least
02:48 - experiment and see if it works for you
02:50 - it seems to help him a lot in managing
02:51 - working on the game while keeping a
02:53 - normal job
02:54 - he also had a very unique support reward
02:56 - you could support him and get a shrimp
02:58 - added to his tank named after you
03:00 - very creative and perfectly fits with
03:02 - the nature of the game
03:03 - it's already in maximum capacity but
03:05 - that was a really cool idea
03:12 - next up ponte pants working on a
03:14 - physics-based boxing game named punch a
03:16 - bunch
03:17 - it's physically based with some pretty
03:19 - deep controls essentially you move
03:21 - within left stick and rotate your body
03:23 - with the right stick
03:24 - and the way that you rotate your body is
03:26 - what defines what type of punch you
03:27 - throw
03:28 - it's an interesting system that allows
03:29 - for some complex moves as opposed to
03:31 - just button mashing and learning combos
03:33 - visually the game looks great he worked
03:35 - as a vfx artist in the film industry and
03:37 - that definitely shows
03:39 - very good looking materials and
03:40 - post-processing effects the actions also
03:42 - have quite a lot of weight
03:43 - behind them with a bunch of juicy
03:45 - effects it definitely looks like it's
03:47 - very satisfying to play which is very
03:48 - important for a fighting game where the
03:49 - total number of possible actions is
03:51 - quite limited
03:52 - the videos are very well filmed and
03:54 - edited nicely entertaining
03:56 - the game is being developed using unreal
03:58 - and has been in development for about 10
04:00 - months
04:00 - he actually quit his job to go full time
04:02 - just recently in that video he mentions
04:04 - the dangers of being stuck in the
04:06 - comfort zone which is definitely great
04:07 - advice for anything in life
04:09 - i would definitely not encourage
04:10 - everyone to just quit their job into
04:12 - game development full-time this is after
04:14 - all a very tough industry
04:15 - but i'm guessing he looked at his
04:17 - analytics and youtube and estimated some
04:19 - sort of trajectory to profitability
04:21 - with a decent youtube channel any low
04:23 - cost of living you can definitely make
04:24 - it work
04:25 - he also showcases a very important part
04:27 - of game development which is getting
04:28 - other people to play the game as it's
04:30 - being developed
04:31 - feedback is crucial and having other
04:33 - people who have different interests and
04:35 - skill sets
04:35 - is absolutely necessary to make a game
04:37 - that appeals to more people and finds
04:39 - success
04:40 - for example he mentions how his
04:42 - girlfriend found a strategy of just
04:43 - spamming non-stop which was not the
04:45 - intended goal of his design
04:46 - so always get your friends family and
04:48 - really anyone willing to play your game
04:50 - but at the same time do keep in mind the
04:52 - bias of the source of that feedback
04:54 - friends and family are likely too nice
04:56 - to give you some truly honest feedback
04:58 - and they will probably be a lot more
04:59 - positive than they would be to a random
05:01 - game they just found on scene
05:03 - in the real world real players are much
05:05 - more brutal and honest so do keep that
05:07 - in mind whenever you listen to the
05:08 - thoughts of your friends and family
05:10 - getting good usable feedback is a huge
05:12 - topic on its own but the best way is to
05:14 - just watch your friends play and don't
05:15 - say anything
05:16 - actions always speak louder than words
05:18 - my only concern with this project is i
05:20 - think it might be a bit
05:21 - too niche fighting games is a very
05:23 - difficult genre to get into both as a
05:25 - player and as a developer
05:27 - the last in the fighting game that found
05:28 - success that i can remember
05:30 - was divekick many years ago which was
05:32 - sold based on its silly premise
05:34 - and if it doesn't end up with online
05:35 - multiplayer or some sort of single
05:37 - player campaign then that makes it even
05:38 - harder to sell
05:40 - it doesn't look great though very
05:41 - visually unique so that won't certainly
05:42 - help it stand out
05:44 - but regardless of how successful the
05:46 - game is the videos are extremely well
05:47 - produced and very entertaining so i have
05:49 - no doubt that he will continue growing
05:51 - and find massive
05:52 - success on youtube also the steam page
05:54 - just went live a few weeks ago so check
05:56 - it out and give it a wish list
05:58 - [Music]
06:01 - then over here we have bw dev working on
06:04 - a management game named lumbermill
06:06 - the game was inspired by two of my
06:08 - favorite games of all time roller
06:09 - coaster tycoon and factorio so as soon
06:11 - as i saw it i was hooked
06:13 - you start in a small forest begin hiring
06:15 - some workers placing some buildings and
06:17 - conveyor belts
06:18 - start turning wood into furniture and
06:20 - continue expanding your empire
06:22 - visually it's got a nice and clean pixel
06:24 - art style the world is randomly
06:26 - generated and very well built
06:28 - everything looks very natural you have
06:30 - clumps of trees and rivers flowing
06:31 - through the world
06:32 - it even has a power system with a second
06:34 - layer for managing all the power
06:36 - infrastructure with several power
06:37 - sources
06:38 - all in all i'm a big fan of design and
06:40 - all the systems and i really hope this
06:42 - one will do well
06:43 - the devlogs are about every two weeks
06:45 - it's being made in unity and star
06:47 - development two years ago
06:48 - he also made a very interesting video
06:51 - highlighting 12 years of game
06:52 - development which also involved trying
06:54 - to turn this concept into a reality with
06:56 - several failed attempts
06:57 - but as usual every failed attempt is
06:59 - always a very valuable learning exercise
07:01 - so those film attempts weren't really
07:03 - failures at all
07:04 - every single one of those gave them the
07:06 - knowledge and experience which makes the
07:07 - current iteration look great
07:09 - so as you go about on your own personal
07:11 - game dev journey keep in mind that
07:12 - failure is part of the process and
07:14 - everything is a learning opportunity
07:16 - and by the way if you find the video
07:18 - helpful consider subscribing and hitting
07:19 - the like button
07:20 - it really helps out the channel and as
07:22 - i've mentioned in several of my own
07:24 - videos where i talk about how to find
07:25 - success with indie games
07:27 - building a following is very important
07:28 - and the simplest way to do that is to
07:30 - have a public steam page as soon as
07:32 - possible so that people can start
07:33 - wishlisting your game
07:34 - this one already has a steam page and
07:36 - currently has 1200 followers so probably
07:39 - around four to five thousand wishlists
07:41 - which is already very good
07:42 - based on the genre and the number of
07:44 - followers and wishlists i would expect
07:45 - this game to be quite successful
07:47 - as always the definition of success
07:49 - depends heavily on a lot of factors
07:50 - like for example the cost of living and
07:52 - how long it's been in development but i
07:54 - do think this one won't do very well
07:56 - either way like i said this is exactly
07:58 - my kind of game so at least i'll be
07:59 - picking it up when it's out
08:01 - the release date on the steam page just
08:02 - says coming soon but it's already quite
08:04 - far long and been in development for
08:06 - over two years
08:06 - so i'm guessing it will be out sometime
08:08 - later this year
08:15 - then we have flow studio currently
08:17 - working on an adventure exploration rpg
08:19 - named lens island
08:20 - you can throw the titular character on
08:22 - this mysterious island with tons of
08:24 - areas to explore build the home of your
08:26 - dreams plant some crops and help out the
08:28 - villagers
08:29 - play around in the nice and happy island
08:31 - and then go down into the dark and
08:33 - gritty caves
08:34 - fight enemies and gather resources to
08:36 - further build your home and your
08:37 - equipment
08:38 - so it's got elements of survival
08:40 - crafting exploration farming combat
08:42 - building and so on
08:43 - tons of depth visually it looks
08:45 - excellent this one has great use of
08:47 - lighting
08:48 - the top island looks beautiful and very
08:50 - bright while the caves look dark and
08:51 - gloomy
08:52 - all of the ui also looks great nice and
08:55 - clean icons all the windows are nicely
08:57 - organized with multiple tabs and scroll
08:59 - bars
09:00 - it's got tons of customization the
09:02 - building system looks very capable
09:04 - you can place floors and then individual
09:06 - walls it even supports multi-story
09:08 - buildings
09:09 - looking at this makes me want to
09:10 - experiment with creating a system like
09:11 - that
09:12 - it allows you to create some very unique
09:14 - very customizable buildings
09:16 - the excellent use of lighting is
09:17 - definitely what makes this game really
09:18 - stand out
09:19 - every screenshot looks gorgeous the day
09:21 - night cycle is very important to the
09:23 - game
09:23 - that's essentially how plants grow and
09:25 - time passes so having some good looking
09:27 - sunrises and sunsets is definitely a
09:29 - huge plus
09:30 - it is being made in unity and has been
09:32 - in development for almost three years
09:34 - and just like with so many devs he
09:36 - mentions in the very first devlog that
09:38 - the goal was actually to make a game in
09:40 - six months to one year
09:41 - so as you can see managing scope is
09:43 - always an issue for everyone
09:45 - this one also has a steam page and
09:46 - currently has 1200 followers so i'm
09:49 - guessing around four to five thousand
09:50 - wish list which is very good
09:52 - there was also a successful kickstarter
09:54 - a while ago and it managed to easily
09:55 - surpass the goal and get forty five
09:57 - thousand dollars
09:58 - the current release date is scheduled
10:00 - for july 21 so this one is definitely
10:02 - one to keep an eye on
10:08 - and finally we have thin matrix working
10:11 - on an unnamed city builder
10:13 - some of you are probably already aware
10:14 - of this channel he's one of the ogs on
10:17 - youtube and made the wildly successful
10:19 - equilinox
10:20 - that game also started as a devlog all
10:22 - the way back in 2015.
10:24 - it's got 2 000 very positive reviews on
10:26 - steam so
10:27 - that one was definitely a massive
10:28 - success right now he's working on this
10:30 - untitled city builder something along
10:32 - the lines of sim city or city skylines
10:35 - so you place down roads and buildings
10:37 - there are people walking around all over
10:39 - as well as cars on the road
10:41 - he hasn't yet mentioned much about the
10:43 - overall design so i wonder how far he's
10:45 - going to push it or what unique spin the
10:47 - game will have
10:48 - for me his devlogs are extremely
10:50 - impressive because he manages to
10:51 - actually fit in quite a lot of code in
10:53 - the videos without making it boring
10:54 - that's definitely a very impressive
10:56 - skill
10:57 - for example in one of the videos he goes
10:59 - through all the math for creating some
11:00 - road meshes
11:01 - and in another one he covers in detail
11:03 - how the pathfinding for the passengers
11:05 - and the car ai works
11:07 - and despite all that complexity the
11:08 - videos are very easy to watch
11:10 - he uses a custom engine written in java
11:13 - and using opengl
11:14 - i believe he's building upon the very
11:16 - same engine that he used for equilinox
11:18 - making your own engine and especially
11:20 - using java would definitely not be my
11:22 - choice
11:22 - but he's already shipped one successful
11:24 - title so clearly he has the skills to
11:26 - pull it off
11:27 - the benefit of making your own engine is
11:29 - that you can control absolutely
11:30 - everything and make the tools perfect
11:32 - for
11:32 - exactly your specific needs however the
11:35 - downside is that you have to literally
11:37 - build everything
11:38 - so in one of the videos he builds a
11:39 - guinea library from scratch which means
11:41 - having to build things like a text box
11:43 - which on an engine like unity you get by
11:45 - default
11:46 - it's been development for 15 months now
11:48 - and it's progressing nicely
11:50 - the devlogs are all extremely chill and
11:52 - very well edited and showcase both game
11:54 - development but also a very
11:56 - healthy lifestyle it's honestly
11:57 - impressive just how balanced his life is
11:59 - that's definitely something that i
12:01 - personally have a lot of trouble with
12:02 - city builders are always a popular genre
12:05 - so that's a good start
12:06 - his channel is also the biggest one of
12:08 - these in terms of views per video
12:10 - so as soon as he puts it on steam i have
12:12 - no doubt he won't gather tons of
12:14 - wishlists instantly
12:15 - and i would also say that the audience
12:17 - for equinox won't be interested in this
12:19 - game
12:19 - both of them have elements of management
12:21 - games so that's one of the benefits of
12:23 - having a long career as an indie game
12:25 - developer
12:26 - if you stick to the same or similar
12:28 - genre you can keep growing an audience
12:30 - and get people interested from game to
12:31 - game
12:32 - that's essentially how i managed to get
12:34 - 10 000 wishlists by the time that i
12:35 - launched my game battle round tycoon
12:37 - a lot of those came from people who
12:39 - played my previous games like game corp
12:41 - and blueprint tycoon
12:44 - alright so there you have it those are 5
12:46 - gamedev channels doing interesting
12:48 - devlogs that you might not have known
12:49 - about
12:50 - go ahead subscribe to their channels
12:52 - follow their journey and let them know
12:53 - how you found them
12:54 - there's links to all in the description
12:56 - do you have any others that you follow
12:58 - if so post them in the comments i'm
13:00 - always interested in finding new ones
13:02 - there's also a bunch of awesome channels
13:04 - doing gamedev content other than street
13:05 - devlogs so i might cover some of those
13:07 - in another video
13:09 - alright so this was an interesting video
13:10 - to make and i hope you enjoyed it
13:12 - thanks for watching and i'll see you
13:14 - next time
13:23 - [Music]
13:27 - you
