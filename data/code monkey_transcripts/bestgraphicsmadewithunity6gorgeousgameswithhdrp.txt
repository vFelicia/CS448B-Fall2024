00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and it's been a few years since Unity
00:04 - released urp and egrp these are the two
00:06 - render pipelines urp or the universal
00:09 - render pipeline is focused on running
00:10 - everywhere and it still looks great but
00:12 - it's not focused on the absolute best
00:14 - visuals possible for that you have the
00:16 - hdrp or the high definition render
00:18 - pipeline so since it's been quite some
00:20 - time since it was released I thought it
00:22 - would be nice to do some research to see
00:24 - what games have already been made using
00:25 - agrp now thankfully there's a really
00:28 - easy way to see if a game is using egrp
00:30 - a while ago I was researching games for
00:33 - my top 10 new releases list and I saw a
00:35 - heart space shipbreaker and on cmdb you
00:38 - can see if the game is using Unity which
00:39 - is what I look at and then it also shows
00:41 - you if it's using urp or agrp basically
00:44 - just goes through the phone list and
00:46 - finds the agrp and Library so with that
00:48 - here we have a really nice list of all
00:50 - of the ajrp games there's already quite
00:52 - a lot of them over 700 so let's look at
00:55 - some of them to see just how far
00:56 - developers have pushed into these
00:58 - visuals however before I start this
01:00 - video let me actually make a quick note
01:01 - on agrp so you don't go and suddenly try
01:04 - converting your entire project
01:06 - it's not something that you change to
01:07 - egrp and everything magically looks
01:09 - better some things doing didn't look
01:11 - better the post-processing the lighting
01:13 - and so on the algorithms that hrp uses
01:16 - are different from the ones that urp
01:17 - uses they are focused on maximum
01:19 - Fidelity instead of Maximum
01:21 - compatibility
01:22 - so those things are indeed kind of
01:24 - automatic however for most things that
01:26 - is not herp simply provides you with
01:28 - more options but as to how good
01:30 - something looks it will highly depend on
01:32 - your assets if you put in low poly asset
01:34 - then swap between urp and hrp you really
01:37 - won't notice much of a difference
01:39 - to see that difference you need to
01:41 - actually use all of the various maps
01:43 - that hdrp shaders let you use
01:45 - so you need an AO map a bump map
01:47 - displacement map reflection map class
01:49 - map metal map and so on without all of
01:52 - those various texture Maps it won't
01:54 - magically look good so I just want to
01:56 - quickly point that out if you're a solo
01:58 - developer like me and you don't have an
02:00 - army of artists working alongside you
02:01 - then hrp won't magically make your game
02:04 - look a lot better so if you're like me
02:06 - definitely stick with the urp oh and by
02:08 - the way I'm currently working on my next
02:10 - steam game called turnover Liberation go
02:12 - ahead and add it to your wish list since
02:14 - I made some of the bumper I'm sticking
02:15 - with urp but I am doing everything I can
02:17 - to make divisions look good I spoke
02:19 - about what access I'm using to achieve
02:20 - that look in another video so even if
02:23 - you're using urp you can definitely
02:24 - still make a good looking game but with
02:26 - that said let's look at some of these
02:28 - games that are built by teams that push
02:29 - egrp to its limits
02:37 - starting off with a game that made me
02:39 - think of the idea for this video heart
02:40 - space shipbreaker this one is a great
02:43 - looking space game you've got plenty of
02:45 - Lights lots of Sparks especially when
02:47 - cutting something they're definitely
02:49 - using the VFX graph quite a lot you've
02:51 - got some gorgeous explosions and lots of
02:53 - particles
02:54 - there's also lots of fancy Shader
02:57 - effects for all of the various
02:58 - inspection modes so putting all that
03:00 - together and this one is definitely a
03:02 - very good looking space game
03:04 - remember
03:06 - to your family
03:08 - and then here's one that's not
03:09 - technically using egrp but it's possibly
03:11 - the best looking realistic game made
03:13 - with yinty it's escape from tarkov as
03:16 - far as I know they use a heavily
03:17 - modified Unity version so it's a custom
03:19 - renderer and not really egrp but
03:21 - whatever they use it definitely pushes
03:23 - Unity to its limits the game is
03:25 - absolutely gorgeous with a realistic art
03:27 - style it looks so good that a lot of
03:29 - people are in disbelief when they hear
03:30 - that it's made with empty but again
03:32 - remember it all looks this good because
03:34 - they have an army of artists building a
03:36 - dozens or so Maps where every single
03:37 - material they need to have regular
03:39 - Albedo maps and occlusion Maps metallic
03:41 - displacement and so on but if you do
03:43 - have the artists to draw with that then
03:45 - this game is an excellent example of
03:46 - what you can achieve and of course on
03:48 - top of that you have excellent High poly
03:50 - meshes some gorgeous lighting and
03:51 - shadows excellent particles and
03:52 - animations you put it all together and
03:54 - escape from tarkov is definitely a sign
03:56 - to build home
04:01 - and up next with some top tier visuals
04:03 - here is made of scur personally I'm not
04:06 - a fan of horror games at all I really
04:07 - can't handle it but if you're looking
04:09 - for the best visuals possible then
04:11 - that's definitely the genre to check the
04:13 - reason is because horror games are
04:14 - usually pre-claustrophobic so you have a
04:17 - tiny amount of assets visible at a
04:19 - certain time which means those assets
04:20 - can be insanely high quality
04:22 - that coupled with the fact that it's
04:24 - usually at night it really helps since
04:25 - games always look better in low light
04:27 - environments so this game definitely
04:29 - features some excellent visuals because
04:31 - of all of that you have some really high
04:33 - quality models and textures with lots of
04:35 - maps there's lots of fire particles
04:37 - eliminating the scene the Enlighten the
04:40 - fog is definitely very high quality
04:41 - everything looks really gorgeous and
04:44 - really scary so it seems that for horror
04:46 - games my recommendation would be to use
04:48 - egrp instead of Erp because so many of
04:50 - these games are focused on those
04:51 - excellent visuals
04:54 - [Applause]
05:00 - for something pretty unique over here we
05:02 - have a briss this one as you can see is
05:05 - all about destruction and in order to
05:07 - make that destruction as satisfying as
05:09 - possible the game uses tons of particles
05:11 - there's lots of flashy visuals to really
05:13 - sell the effect
05:14 - all of those gorgeous effects and the
05:16 - camera also really helps to sell the
05:17 - scale of the game when coupled with the
05:19 - sound it really makes every action look
05:21 - and feel really powerful
05:28 - another genre that benefits a lot from
05:30 - some great Visions are adventure games
05:32 - so here is the gorgeous looking Siberia
05:34 - the world before it's got some really
05:36 - nice models and lighting it really
05:39 - achieves the goal of looking like a very
05:40 - convincing world and being an adventure
05:43 - game means that you interact with
05:44 - objects with a very close camera and
05:47 - because of using egrp those objects all
05:49 - look really excellent when you inspect
05:50 - and rotate them
05:52 - just what I was looking for perfect and
05:56 - up next we have tinted real Conquest
05:58 - this one features some really high-end
06:00 - models and textures lots of
06:02 - post-processing to really make the game
06:03 - Shine the depth of field effect is
06:05 - really very high quality here you can
06:07 - definitely see lots of high quality
06:09 - models with all those maps that I was
06:10 - talking about so the ground has some
06:12 - displacement the characters have certain
06:14 - shiny surfaces and also the game is at
06:16 - night which again usually helps in
06:18 - making games look great
06:20 - you will fall every single time for
06:25 - something flashy here is recompile I
06:28 - remember seeing this one tons of times
06:29 - for quite a long time while on Twitter
06:31 - every day there was a new flashy gif the
06:34 - game definitely looks great it's got
06:36 - plenty of Lights lots of effects and
06:38 - particles despite being yet another 3D
06:40 - Puzzle platform and it really looks
06:42 - quite unique
06:43 - [Music]
06:48 - and up next something on the management
06:49 - genre here is Airborne Kingdom again
06:52 - some gorgeous post Crossing really nice
06:54 - of the field it has plenty of gorgeous
06:57 - custom shaders for selecting and placing
06:59 - down the objects features some great
07:01 - lighting quality bouncing off of
07:03 - everything and of course some of the
07:04 - assets look really great
07:06 - foreign
07:09 - so these are seven games out now using
07:12 - Unity hdrp to produce some great visuals
07:14 - it goes to show that if you have some
07:16 - super high quality assets with tons of
07:18 - super high res texture maps with all
07:20 - that Unity can definitely look gorgeous
07:22 - if you want go ahead and give it a try
07:24 - create a new project with the official
07:26 - egrp sample template to see just how
07:29 - good it can look alright hope that's
07:31 - useful check out these videos to learn
07:32 - some more thanks to these awesome
07:34 - patreon supporters for making these
07:36 - videos possible thank you for watching
07:38 - and I'll see you next time
07:41 - [Music]
