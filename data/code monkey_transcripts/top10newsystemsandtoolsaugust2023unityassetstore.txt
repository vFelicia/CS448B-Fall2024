00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the SSR is full of awesome tools and
00:04 - assets to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - August 23. this one is a list of paid
00:11 - systems and tools in the last video I'm
00:12 - already covered the best three new
00:14 - assets and next one I'll cover top
00:15 - visuals and effects as always there's
00:17 - links to the ads in the description and
00:18 - as a bonus you can use the coupon code
00:19 - monkey 10 to get 10 off your order and
00:21 - the dev days of summer sale is still
00:23 - alive there's still a bunch of excellent
00:25 - assets on sale and over on humble if you
00:27 - need some realistic visuals there's a
00:29 - bundle with a huge discount this is a
00:30 - huge pack with a bunch of animations a
00:32 - bunch of monsters regular animals you've
00:34 - got some wizard spells some fire some
00:36 - horses some lava explosion GUI and so on
00:38 - along with a really nice realistic style
00:40 - and all for a really great discount
00:42 - check them out with the link in the
00:43 - description alright so starting off with
00:45 - a really nice 2D water system there are
00:48 - actually tons of water systems on the
00:49 - store but they are usually in 3D so it's
00:51 - great to see a 2d one and this one does
00:53 - look excellent the water has some really
00:55 - nice Reflections some really nice waves
00:57 - and refraction it can include some blur
00:59 - with Fallout off it works on infinite
01:01 - scrolling it's even got some really
01:03 - interesting Dynamic waves so this looks
01:05 - really great and it works either on a
01:07 - formal side view kind of like a
01:08 - platformer or a more of a top-down view
01:10 - if you have a 2d game then adding some
01:12 - gorgeous one like this one will really
01:14 - help you send out next adding primitive
01:16 - colliders on top of objects is one task
01:18 - that is really tricky so here's the deal
01:20 - to help you do that in case you don't
01:21 - know using primitive colliders is so
01:24 - much more performant than using mesh
01:25 - colliders so you should always use
01:27 - Primitives whenever possible with don't
01:29 - like this one it makes it really easy to
01:30 - use to build all of your colliders on
01:32 - any object there's no need to manually
01:34 - add a new box on leather every time and
01:36 - then painfully position it manually you
01:38 - just hold the button drag a widget and
01:40 - it automatically spawns a brand new one
01:42 - it also snaps to position so it makes it
01:43 - really easy to position it easily
01:45 - duplicates you can even play around with
01:47 - the visual for the bounce and the
01:49 - handles so this looks like a very useful
01:50 - tool if you need to quickly build tons
01:52 - of custom colors then here's a fun
01:54 - interesting one it's called better
01:56 - transform apparently this one replaces
01:58 - the default Transformer with a custom
02:00 - transform inspector that adds a bunch
02:02 - more options you can easily toggle
02:04 - between local space and World space you
02:06 - can modify the actual object size
02:07 - without fiddling with the scale you can
02:09 - modify it in metric or imperial or
02:11 - anything you want you can also visualize
02:13 - the child and parent info and even see
02:15 - some extra stats on the scene view so
02:17 - it's pretty interesting to see the
02:18 - transform component which is very much
02:19 - the core of unity seeing that one be
02:21 - expanded in such an interesting use case
02:23 - next here's an interesting sound tool
02:25 - one of the best ways to make your game
02:26 - sound great is just to have some
02:28 - interactive sound meaning make it sound
02:30 - different depending on what surface the
02:31 - player is walking on if it's on grass
02:33 - play a grassy sound if it's on metal
02:35 - play a metallic sound or another way to
02:37 - really punish your sound is just play
02:38 - some environment sounds this too helps
02:40 - you set all that up in a really
02:42 - interesting way basically it takes a
02:44 - screenshot of your world then you draw
02:45 - on top of it to define the sound areas
02:47 - just draw the shape in any image program
02:49 - it also supports fitting so you fade
02:51 - from white to black and as you move away
02:53 - for example the river volume goes lower
02:55 - and lower definitely a very interesting
02:57 - tool and by being based on images it can
02:59 - become super detailed then if you're
03:01 - working with 2D Sprite animations this
03:03 - one might help it basically takes a
03:05 - giant Sprite sheet of all of your
03:06 - animation frames and then you can slice
03:08 - blocks of animations from each of those
03:10 - frames importantly the animations don't
03:12 - need to be perfectly sequential so you
03:14 - can have something like for example a
03:16 - flashing animation in a corner which you
03:17 - can then reuse in multiple animations
03:19 - the whole thing is stored in what they
03:21 - call a blockchain which you can then
03:22 - reuse with multiple spreadsheets to
03:24 - essentially share animations between
03:26 - characters this looks like pretty useful
03:27 - 2D sprite animation tool with some like
03:30 - this you don't need to generate tons of
03:31 - individual spreadsheet images then if
03:33 - your game has something with legs here
03:35 - is a legs animator really the perfect
03:37 - name this one is an ik tool as the
03:39 - character moves around it automatically
03:41 - places the feet on the correct positions
03:43 - so as you go up or down stairs up or
03:45 - down slopes everything is placed
03:46 - perfectly this is one of those things
03:48 - that seems really small but makes a huge
03:50 - difference in the final game everything
03:51 - looks so much more natural building this
03:53 - kind of thing yourself can definitely be
03:55 - done but it's usually quite tricky so an
03:57 - easy to use to unlike this one can be
03:58 - very helpful and this this one does look
04:00 - like it has a really easy setup you just
04:02 - add a component Define the legs and
04:04 - everything just works although of course
04:06 - you also have tons of options to get it
04:07 - working exactly as you want it works on
04:09 - everything from regular bipedal
04:11 - humanoids to some insects with dozen
04:13 - legs adding Dynamic animations always
04:15 - helps make your game feel much more
04:16 - polished and if you like Dynamic
04:18 - animations then check out the other
04:19 - assets by the same developer they're all
04:21 - really great next here is a really
04:23 - special one all about aerodynamics this
04:25 - one lets you create some fluid zones
04:27 - which you can then interact with all
04:28 - kinds of aerodynamic objects so for
04:31 - example as you apply some wind it
04:32 - correctly applies those forces to a
04:34 - plane or a turbine now me I'm no
04:36 - physicist but this seems to be quite
04:38 - realistic the way the demo with the
04:39 - helicopter and the wind generator Works
04:41 - looks very physically accurate it's got
04:43 - some really interesting visualization
04:45 - tools just looking at those makes it
04:47 - seem like it would be super fun to play
04:48 - with you can simulate all kinds of wind
04:50 - forces and vectors you can visualize the
04:52 - flow around the wing or turbulence
04:54 - behind a spinning ball if the numbers
04:56 - are indeed accurate then this could also
04:58 - be a fun way to learn about physics then
05:00 - something that every game must have is
05:02 - settings but building those yourself is
05:04 - always really annoying personally I
05:05 - really do not enjoy that task especially
05:07 - if you want to build something that is
05:08 - robust with tons of settings so in that
05:10 - case a tune like this one really helps
05:12 - all these settings are already formally
05:14 - pre-made all of these sliders for volume
05:16 - changing resolution changing phone
05:18 - screen or vsync modifying anti-aliasing
05:20 - texture resolution Shadows
05:22 - post-processing this one really does
05:23 - seem to include all the settings that
05:25 - you could possibly want honestly I think
05:27 - I might actually pick this one up for my
05:28 - upcoming steam game it would definitely
05:30 - save me dozens of hours of building all
05:32 - of this by myself next for another
05:33 - system that you could spend the time to
05:35 - build yourself or you can just pick up
05:37 - something very robust here is a really
05:39 - nice versatile inventory system it
05:42 - includes all the possible inventory
05:43 - actions you could ever need you can pick
05:45 - up objects or drop them you can stack
05:47 - them and split multiple Stacks you can
05:49 - even have equipment slots you can handle
05:51 - durability you can consume or use items
05:54 - the inventory has positioning so you can
05:56 - shift them around in the inventory you
05:57 - can activate them through a Hotbar this
05:59 - seal also comes with a custom inspector
06:01 - to make it really easy to create and set
06:03 - up any item you want so this one doesn't
06:05 - look like a really great tool if you
06:06 - don't want to build your own inventory
06:08 - from scratch then if you'd like to add
06:10 - vegetation to your worms check out this
06:11 - one it's a tool to help you spawn trees
06:13 - and grass it also lets you add it not
06:16 - just to the terrain but on top of
06:17 - objects as well it claims to be
06:19 - extremely performant which is very
06:20 - important adding tons of vegetation can
06:22 - very easily tank the frame rate this one
06:24 - includes an example scene with 10
06:26 - Sunrise vegetation models of them ready
06:28 - to be used alright so those are my top
06:30 - 10 new tools and systems on the NTS
06:32 - store for August 23 there's links on the
06:34 - description and as a bonus you can use
06:35 - the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off
06:37 - your order also check out my own free
