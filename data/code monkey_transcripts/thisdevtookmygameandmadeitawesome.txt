00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - here's a quick video on something really
00:03 - awesome that I saw recently that I just
00:05 - have to tell you about so a few months
00:07 - ago I launched my free 10 hour course
00:08 - the response has been really awesome
00:10 - lots of people learn a ton from
00:11 - following the course the percentage of
00:13 - people who finish the course is low
00:14 - which is expected but every person that
00:15 - does go through the whole thing really
00:17 - loves it and one of the main goals with
00:19 - this course was to teach you how to
00:20 - write good clean code that is adaptable
00:22 - and easily expandable I've only recently
00:24 - made the design so that it's pretty easy
00:25 - to add more recipes more objects more
00:27 - interactions and so on and recently
00:29 - wouldn't have really put that to the
00:30 - test here eliane went through the course
00:32 - and then built upon it to make something
00:34 - completely unique right away you can see
00:36 - there's a completely different map all
00:37 - with unique art the player's original as
00:39 - is the music there are new recipes new
00:41 - objects new counters that do completely
00:43 - different things and perhaps most
00:45 - impressive all is how it even features a
00:47 - different completion goal in my original
00:49 - game you just dropped the correct recipe
00:50 - on the delivery counter and that's it
00:52 - whereas here there are actual clients
00:54 - that come into the restaurant they sit
00:55 - down on a specific table and they make a
00:57 - request this one change alone really
00:59 - changes how the game were Works instead
01:00 - of always dropping off the recipe on the
01:02 - same place now it's a different place
01:03 - every time another excellent addition is
01:05 - having to wash dishes with a completely
01:07 - new countertime again in the course I
01:09 - made this super simple the recipe is
01:11 - delivered and clean plates just spawned
01:13 - but here you actually need to wash them
01:14 - the clients finish eating and you need
01:16 - to pick them up take them to a brand new
01:18 - counter for washing dishes and then it
01:20 - sponsee clean dishes in terms of
01:21 - ingredients they are all different now
01:23 - there's bread which must be sliced there
01:25 - are some eggs which must be fried
01:26 - there's even a new counter for some
01:28 - boiling water then you put that boiling
01:30 - water onto a cup in order to make a
01:32 - proper cup of tea and there are even
01:33 - multiple levels each with different
01:35 - recipes the recipe UI clearly shows all
01:37 - the steps needed to cook each recipe and
01:39 - when the customers are done they will
01:41 - also leave a tip based on how quickly
01:43 - you serve them then you can take that
01:44 - money to operate the business and the
01:46 - character I was really impressed when I
01:47 - saw all these changes this is exactly
01:49 - what I was hoping people would do with
01:51 - the course take it as a base and really
01:52 - expand upon it this is an excellent
01:54 - example of what you should do if you're
01:56 - really trying to learn Game Dev every
01:57 - once in a while I see some kind of
01:59 - comment asking how do Escape tutorial
02:01 - hell and this is exactly how you do it
02:02 - don't just blindly copy paste while
02:04 - following some tutorial or some course
02:06 - use them to learn something and then
02:08 - test your knowledge by modifying and
02:09 - building upon it if you do that you will
02:11 - learn so much more so congrats only in
02:13 - really great job on taking a course game
02:15 - as a base and completely overhauling it
02:17 - into something very unique my advice
02:19 - right now is take this game to the
02:21 - Finish Line add some more polish create
02:23 - a proper level progression add more
02:25 - upgrades make it a complete experience
02:27 - and publish it to steam remember that if
02:29 - you want to become a game that of the
02:30 - publishing part is also essential so I
02:32 - highly encourage people to go through it
02:33 - you won't learn a massive amount from
02:35 - releasing your first proper game on
02:36 - Steam even if it doesn't end up selling
02:38 - anything speaking of steam I'm currently
02:40 - working on my next team game dinky
02:41 - Guardians this is going to be my 9th
02:43 - steam release it's a fun Co-op action
02:45 - building automation game go ahead and
02:47 - edit your wishlist and if you haven't
02:49 - yet gone through my free complete course
02:50 - then go ahead and give it a try as you
02:52 - can see here you can take that course as
02:54 - a base and massively expand upon it you
02:55 - can expand upon it in this way to make a
02:57 - more complex kitchen or restaurant game
02:59 - but you can also take these same
03:01 - Concepts and apply them to different
03:02 - ways the game is really just all about
03:04 - interacting with various counters and
03:06 - various objects so for example you could
03:08 - make some kind of car mechanic Simulator
03:09 - game you could grab Nuts and Bolts from
03:12 - the container counters and create some
03:13 - special encounters to build the car or
03:15 - perhaps a strategy game where you're
03:17 - building weapons to deliver to some
03:18 - soldiers or maybe use some AI to control
03:20 - the player and turn it into some kind of
03:22 - automation game so you can really take
03:24 - this game as a base and really build
03:25 - upon it in many ways if you did go
03:27 - through the course but you just did the
03:29 - course as it was and nothing else then
03:30 - perhaps try going back to it and
03:32 - building upon it just like this and of
03:34 - course everything that I said here also
03:35 - applies to the follow-up free
03:36 - multiplayer course you can also build
03:38 - upon that one in the same way and make
03:40 - some unique multiplayer games so once
03:41 - again congrats to Elian great job on
03:44 - this massive overhaul I hope you
03:45 - continue working on it thank you all for
03:46 - watching and I'll see you next time
03:59 - [Music]
04:01 - thank you
