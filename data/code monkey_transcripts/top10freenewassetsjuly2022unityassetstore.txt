00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - the asset stores full of awesome tools
00:03 - and assets to help you make your own
00:05 - games and there's more and more awesome
00:06 - stuff coming out every month so in this
00:08 - video let's check out some highlights
00:09 - for july of 22. in this first video i'll
00:11 - be covering a list of three assets and
00:13 - next ones i will be covering paid ads
00:15 - and tools check out the phone playlist
00:17 - to see all of the highlights every month
00:18 - you might find something that would be
00:19 - perfect for whatever project you're
00:21 - currently working on let me know in the
00:23 - comments if you pick up any of these and
00:24 - what you intend to do them also you
00:26 - might have noticed that i didn't do one
00:27 - of these videos last month the reason
00:29 - for that is because i was super busy
00:31 - working on my turn-based strategy course
00:33 - which is finally done after five months
00:35 - of work so if you want to take your game
00:37 - dev skills from beginner to advanced
00:38 - then check out the course and by the way
00:40 - check out my own ads on the store so far
00:42 - i've made the free healer system which
00:44 - is a super simple way to add keys and
00:45 - doors to your game and the mouse cursor
00:47 - system pro which is a very easy to use
00:49 - tool to help you create custom animated
00:51 - cursors to really make your game send
00:53 - out
00:54 - and finally the free health system which
00:55 - lets you easily add health to any object
00:58 - in your games alright so onto the top 10
01:00 - list starting off with a pretty
01:01 - interesting tool for aligning your
01:03 - objects onto surfaces
01:05 - this one is a tool that does exactly one
01:06 - thing and does it very well you take
01:08 - your selected object and you can snap it
01:11 - and rotate it to whatever object you
01:13 - want
01:13 - this is a very simple tool that will
01:15 - definitely save you tons of times if you
01:17 - need to attach objects to non-flat areas
01:19 - so if you want to add a mask to your
01:21 - capsule or perhaps you have a spherical
01:23 - world then this tool can definitely be
01:25 - very useful up next if you need a bunch
01:27 - of cute cartoony heroes check out this
01:29 - one really great style reminds me of
01:31 - link's awakening features two characters
01:34 - male and female holding a sword and a
01:36 - shield also comes with quite a nice
01:38 - amount of animations about 15. and if
01:40 - you like this style and the quality of
01:42 - this asset then this dev has a bunch
01:44 - more packs with tons of characters and
01:45 - monsters
01:46 - then here's a bit of a strange one it's
01:48 - a zombie it's got what looks like some
01:51 - pretty nice animations very expressive
01:53 - they would definitely look super scary
01:55 - in a dark game with a nice model
01:57 - although this asset isn't really
01:58 - animations it's the controller that
02:00 - moves them so this logic of pushing the
02:02 - zombie and having it fall down in a nice
02:04 - satisfying way that is part of the asset
02:06 - so it looks really nice although not
02:08 - sure how the moving non-animations works
02:11 - but if you're interested in free so
02:12 - check it out then if you have some flags
02:15 - in your game and you want to make them
02:16 - flow with wind look at this shader
02:18 - there's lots of parameters you can
02:20 - change to affect the wind intensity the
02:22 - texture scroll speed and so on so it's a
02:24 - pretty simple shader and it doesn't look
02:26 - great next up if your game features some
02:28 - house interior look at this one
02:30 - it includes 43 props all of them in a
02:33 - nice low poly style so perfect for
02:35 - casual mobile games or really anything
02:37 - where you want to build a house interior
02:38 - like perhaps making a game like the sims
02:40 - and if you like this style then this dev
02:42 - has tons more packs with tons more
02:44 - objects
02:45 - then for an interesting tool a polygon
02:47 - 2d collider solver collisions with weird
02:50 - shapes are always a bit tricky and
02:52 - apparently the default unity box 2d
02:55 - physics that physics engine apparently
02:56 - has some trouble with some kind of
02:58 - convex shapes so this tool appears to
03:01 - solve that you can easily create any
03:03 - shape and it handles collisions even
03:05 - with a convex mesh
03:07 - you can easily handle collisions even
03:09 - with these weird shapes
03:10 - up next something pretty simple here's a
03:12 - low poly ak-47
03:15 - this one is a very iconic weapon really
03:17 - nice style it features a folding stock
03:19 - and a bunch of attachments so with this
03:21 - free asset would be great to experiment
03:22 - with some kind of attachment system and
03:25 - also lots of the parts are separated so
03:26 - you can easily animate them then if you
03:28 - have a weapon you need some kind of
03:30 - controller so here's a free fps
03:32 - controller contains a bunch of the
03:34 - features that you would need for such a
03:35 - controller
03:36 - so for example it features smooth item
03:39 - switching it features head bob some
03:41 - movement enhanced effects and much more
03:43 - also includes a bunch of 3d models for
03:45 - the demo scene so there's a nice leather
03:47 - hacks crowbar and a bunch more
03:49 - up next if you need some icons look at
03:51 - this one it's a nice collection of items
03:54 - for you to use in your medieval games
03:55 - and you can easily adjust the background
03:57 - to get some nice rarity color variation
04:00 - and then for another interesting tool
04:01 - here is a upnp connector
04:04 - this has to do with nat and firewalls if
04:06 - you've ever tried to make a multiplayer
04:07 - game you know how tricky this is to
04:09 - manage
04:10 - so this asset tries to solve that by
04:11 - talking to your router directly to setup
04:13 - port forwarding all right so those are
04:15 - my top 10 free new assets on the unity
04:17 - ssr for july of 22. there's links while
04:20 - in the description and also check out my
04:22 - own free and paid assets on the store
