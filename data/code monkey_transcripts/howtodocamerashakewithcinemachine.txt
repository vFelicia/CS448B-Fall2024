00:00 - in this video we're going to apply some
00:01 - camera shake using cinema sheen this is
00:04 - a very simple effect that you can add to
00:05 - your game to make it feel a lot but
00:07 - adding it to your scene machine virtual
00:09 - cameras is very easy let's begin
00:14 - [Music]
00:18 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:21 - and this channel is all about helping
00:22 - you learn how to make your own games
00:24 - with nf2 torrents made by a professional
00:26 - indie game developer so if you find the
00:28 - video helpful consider subscribing
00:29 - ok so let's add some nice and simple
00:32 - camera shake now normally I have all my
00:34 - cameras with a custom script but I've
00:36 - been using same machine more and more
00:38 - since it's so useful but when I went
00:40 - looking into how to apply camera shake
00:42 - to same machine I couldn't find much
00:43 - information on it so if you're facing
00:46 - this issue then hopefully this video
00:47 - will help since it really is very simple
00:49 - okay so here's my scene I have my simple
00:52 - player character I can move around and
00:54 - shoot and right now there's no camera
00:56 - shake so it makes the shooting feel very
00:58 - weak check out the code monkey app on
01:01 - Steam interactive tutorials complete
01:03 - games and more click knowing the
01:04 - description and add it to your wish list
01:06 - this video is made possible thanks to
01:08 - these awesome supporters go to
01:10 - patreon.com/scishow monkey to get some
01:12 - perks and help keep the videos free for
01:14 - everyone alright so let's add it now
01:17 - here in the editor everything is set up
01:20 - using same machine now if you're not
01:22 - familiar woodson machine then check the
01:24 - link in the description where I cover
01:25 - the video on how to get started here the
01:28 - main camera has the same machine brain
01:29 - and down here is the virtual camera so
01:32 - it is simply set up just to form with
01:34 - this player character it's a very basic
01:36 - setup and now the key for adding screen
01:39 - shake is very simple down here we have a
01:41 - film for the noise so change it from
01:44 - none to a basic multi-channel permanent
01:46 - and now we can see that we need a noise
01:49 - profile now there are already some
01:50 - pre-made presets so for example let's
01:53 - use e60 shake and now here we can play
01:56 - around with these values so here with
01:59 - the game running we can see the noise in
02:00 - action now here by modifying the
02:02 - frequency we can adjust how often the
02:04 - camera shakes and by modifying the
02:06 - amplitude we can adjust how much it
02:09 - actually shakes so as we increase then
02:11 - each shake moves the camera much further
02:13 - so in this case what we're going to do
02:15 - is set the frequency to a certain value
02:16 - and then all we need is a script that
02:19 - sets the amplitude to a certain amount
02:22 - and then slowly decreases it back down
02:24 - to zero all right so let's make that
02:26 - script here now let's create a new C
02:28 - sharp script compass our scene machine
02:31 - shake and let's write the script on to
02:34 - our virtual camera game object okay now
02:37 - in here first we need to grab our
02:39 - virtual camera so let's get it on our
02:42 - awake up here we need to add using same
02:47 - machine then we can do a get component
02:51 - of our scene machine virtual camera
02:59 - alright we have a film for our camera
03:01 - now let's make a function to shake it
03:06 - here we're going to receive a float for
03:09 - the intensity of the shape and also a
03:12 - float for the timer so we're going to
03:16 - shake the camera using this intensity
03:17 - for this long and now we access our
03:20 - scene machine virtual camera in order to
03:22 - set the amplitude so we go into our
03:31 - scene machine virtual camera we get this
03:33 - in machine component of type of our
03:35 - basic multi-channel per line and then we
03:37 - modify the amplitude game and we set it
03:40 - to that intensity alright so this won't
03:42 - make the camera shake and now here we
03:44 - have two methods that we can use for
03:46 - handling the time one approach is to
03:49 - only the amplitude at this amount and
03:51 - after this amount of time we drop it to
03:53 - zero or we can slowly decreases over
03:56 - time let's first try out with the simple
03:58 - timer so let's store it in the field and
04:04 - here we set it okay then we have our
04:08 - private rolling update where we're going
04:10 - to count down the shake timer alright so
04:18 - if we have a shake timer then we count
04:20 - it down by time.deltatime
04:21 - and then if it's under zero then once
04:24 - again we grab our multi-channel purlins
04:26 - and we set the amplitude back to zero
04:28 - okay so now all we need to do is to call
04:30 - this script from somewhere now in here I
04:33 - have my player script and here is where
04:36 - I'm handling the shooting so it's just
04:39 - doing a bond with recast and spawning
04:41 - some effects so it's in here that we
04:43 - want to shake our
04:43 - camera now back in our sin machine shake
04:46 - we want this to be very easy to use so
04:48 - in order to do that let's make a static
04:50 - instance so we have our static instance
04:58 - that we set on our wink so now back in
05:01 - the player here we can access our same
05:03 - machine shake access the instance and
05:06 - call our shake camera function now let's
05:09 - give it some intensity and some time all
05:12 - right that you do it let's test ok so
05:15 - here I am and shoot any of their yo it
05:17 - did indeed shake now when I should it's
05:19 - shaking way too much but yep there your
05:21 - we have our camera shake using sin
05:23 - machine so here it is with a more
05:26 - manageable intensity right awesome so
05:29 - this is our first method it simply
05:31 - starts and stops shaking after one
05:34 - now let's movement the second slow drop
05:36 - method so here on our update instead of
05:39 - counting down the timer and then setting
05:41 - it to zero what we need to use is our
05:44 - math work so this interpolates a value
05:48 - between a and b over t so we need our
05:51 - starting intensity so we have the
05:57 - starting intensity and we're going to
05:59 - want to order that starting from the
06:02 - starting intensity going towards zero
06:04 - and over time which won't be our time so
06:16 - we store the shake timer total and as
06:18 - the shake timer goes down then this one
06:21 - essentially start from 1 and go down to
06:23 - 0 right so we just apply this alert ok
06:31 - so just like this let's test ok here we
06:35 - are and shoot and you clear yo now it's
06:37 - a bit more so so this one goes down a
06:40 - bit more smoothly than the other
06:41 - approach now which one you use brown
06:44 - depends on what design you're going for
06:45 - when I snap your n1 is smoother this
06:48 - method for example would be better if
06:50 - you had some sort of explosion so as I
06:51 - shoot if there are your shakes a lot and
06:54 - then slow only goes back down to zero so
06:57 - again relative
06:58 - the usage alright so here there is a
07:00 - very simple effect which now you know
07:02 - how to apply when using sin machine
