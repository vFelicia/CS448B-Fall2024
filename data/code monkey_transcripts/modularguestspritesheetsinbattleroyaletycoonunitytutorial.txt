00:00 - hello and welcome I am your code monkey
00:01 - in this video we're going to create
00:02 - modular spreadsheets as used in
00:04 - valmarana tycoon let's begin
00:09 - so the goal is to make our guest is
00:10 - unique as possible if they all look the
00:12 - same then it wouldn't look very boring
00:14 - so we need some variation one way we
00:16 - could do it is similarly by making a lot
00:18 - of different spreadsheets that would
00:20 - work but it would be a lot of work
00:21 - meaning each unique spreadsheet one by
00:23 - one so the better option is to have
00:25 - modular spreadsheets where we create the
00:27 - final spreadsheets from a series of base
00:29 - body parts the game is out now on Steam
00:32 - so check it out to see what I'm teaching
00:33 - here apply to a rental game so again
00:36 - this is the sprite sheet that the
00:37 - animation system uses we have a head
00:40 - body hand and foot and here is the idle
00:44 - animation being pointed so this is the
00:46 - sprite sheet and over here I have a
00:47 - spreadsheet with just a bunch of bodies
00:50 - and over here a bunch of heads we want
00:52 - to create the final spreadsheet
00:53 - dynamically by composing it with
00:55 - different bodies and faces there are
00:57 - some parts of the spreadsheet that don't
00:58 - change so we are going to use this one
01:00 - as our base it already has the hand and
01:03 - the foot which we're going to leave the
01:04 - same for everyone all right so let's
01:06 - make some code create a new c-sharp
01:08 - script for a simple game hello so over
01:11 - here first of all we're going to need
01:12 - some serialize fields for a private
01:15 - texture 2d for our base texture then
01:19 - we're also going to have one for the
01:20 - head texture and for the body texture so
01:24 - let's set things up on a private void
01:27 - awake first thing we need is to create a
01:29 - new texture 2d this won't be our texture
01:31 - which will be a new texture 2d we'll
01:34 - give it a width and height using the
01:36 - same as on the actual spreadsheet so
01:38 - it's 512 by 512 for the texture format
01:41 - we're going to use our GBA in order to
01:44 - have encores and the Alpha Channel and
01:46 - finally enabled mid Maps now inside our
01:50 - texture we have two methods that we're
01:52 - going to use we're going to use get
01:53 - pixels which returns a flat array
01:56 - containing the color of each pixel and
01:58 - then we're going to use set pixels which
02:01 - takes an array of colors and sets the
02:03 - pixels on a given position
02:04 - so let's first copy on with our base
02:06 - pixels into the newly created texture so
02:09 - create a color array for the
02:12 - spreadsheet-based pixels now we're going
02:15 - to grab the base texture dot get pixels
02:18 - grab the text on starting on zero zero
02:20 - and going for five
02:21 - 25:12 then using these pixels we're
02:25 - going to go into our texture not set
02:27 - pixels and place them on zero zero width
02:30 - and height of five twelve and give it
02:32 - this array okay so just like that our
02:35 - dynamically created texture shouldn't
02:36 - look exactly like our base texture and
02:38 - then after we set the pixels in order to
02:41 - apply the changes we need to call
02:42 - texture dot apply so it says to see if
02:45 - everything is working correctly over
02:47 - here in the editor for testing I have a
02:49 - quad which is using the guest material
02:52 - and as you can see it has no texture and
02:54 - next to it I have a guest game object
02:57 - which contains a body which again mesh
02:59 - renderer mesh filter and contains the
03:01 - guest material so let's have a civilized
03:04 - film for our guest material so we can
03:06 - change the texture inside the material
03:07 - so in here the same thing for a
03:09 - serialize field for a private material
03:12 - guest material and then when we create
03:15 - our texture we can set the gaps material
03:18 - that main texture and set the main
03:20 - texture to our neon created texture now
03:22 - one more thing we need to do is in order
03:24 - to use get pixels and set pixels we have
03:27 - to come here into our texture settings
03:30 - and in here we need to enable read and
03:32 - write so we need to do this for the body
03:34 - the head and the base and they won't
03:36 - read right on all of them
03:37 - okay so let's s and see if our sprite
03:39 - sheet is being correctly created and yep
03:42 - there it is our quad looks exactly just
03:44 - like our base texture but this is
03:45 - displaying our dynamically accentuated
03:48 - texture and the guests over here is
03:50 - using that same texture and as you can
03:51 - see the hands are correctly animated so
03:53 - now let's add a body and a head so first
03:56 - let's just grab the first one the head
03:58 - it has the size of 128 by 128 so we
04:01 - define a color ray for the head pixels
04:04 - we're going to go into the head texture
04:06 - and get the pixels starting on zero zero
04:10 - and going for 128 and 128 then we place
04:13 - them in the correct position on the
04:14 - spreadsheet so texture dot set pixels in
04:17 - order to view the correct coordinates
04:19 - the origin for the texture is on the
04:21 - lower left corner so our head is on an X
04:24 - of zero and on a Y of 384 so here we set
04:28 - the pixels on a nexus 0 Y of 384 with a
04:31 - walk with
04:32 - 128 128 and give it to e head pixels now
04:35 - let's do the same thing for the body and
04:40 - the body is on 256 okay so it's Essen we
04:44 - should be able to see our guess
04:45 - correctly with the initial body and head
04:47 - yep there's the head and body being
04:49 - correctly placed in our spreadsheet and
04:51 - correctly used for the animations now
04:53 - that we can copy a single body part we
04:55 - can easily randomize which body part we
04:57 - actually select so here on the head
04:59 - spreadsheet we have four different heads
05:01 - so we can randomize between each of them
05:03 - and same thing for our bodies so you
05:05 - know let's first define in for the head
05:07 - index which won't be a random range
05:09 - between 0 & 4 and now the head pixels
05:14 - each of them is separated by 128 so we
05:17 - do 128 multiplied by the index and then
05:20 - we place it on the exact same position
05:22 - so let's do the same thing for our body
05:24 - index and just like that we should be
05:28 - correctly using a random head and a
05:30 - random body so now let's just copy this
05:32 - code into its own function so we got a
05:41 - nice function we can call to generate a
05:44 - new texture which goes through here
05:45 - that's the same thing and we apply that
05:47 - created texture into our guess material
05:50 - and now for testing let's add a debug
05:52 - button so here I'm going to use the CMD
05:55 - web class to create a button on the UI
05:57 - this class is part of the code monkey
05:59 - Telly's that you can grab for free from
06:01 - unity code monkey comm so essentially
06:08 - we're creating a debug button in order
06:10 - to set the random texture which again
06:12 - will get a new texture every time we
06:14 - click ok so let's test and yep there's a
06:17 - guest with a random head and a random
06:19 - body and if I click the button there you
06:21 - go every time we are getting a random
06:23 - head random body and everything looks
06:26 - very unique so we can click this and we
06:28 - just four heads and four bodies you can
06:31 - see just how many different variations
06:32 - we can have the game is out now on Steam
06:35 - so check it out to see what I'm teaching
06:36 - here apply to a real game so there you
06:38 - have it we created a new unique texture
06:40 - by combining a random body and head in
06:43 - the next video we're going to
06:44 - dynamically
06:45 - our heads bright with a random beard and
06:47 - hair as always he can download the
06:49 - project files in utilities from mt
06:50 - called monkey calm if you have any
06:52 - questions post them in the comments and
06:53 - I'll do my best answer them subscribe
06:55 - for more videos and I'll see you next
06:56 - time
