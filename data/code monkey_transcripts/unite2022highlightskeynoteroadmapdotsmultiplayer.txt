00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and I just got back from United 22 in
00:04 - Montreal it was great fun lots of
00:06 - interesting talks and it's always great
00:07 - to meet up with other ENT creators and
00:09 - enti devs and actually just before I get
00:11 - to the main part of this video there was
00:12 - a little tidbit of information that I
00:14 - picked up at unite which explains quite
00:16 - a lot about Unity communication or like
00:18 - thereof these past few years there was
00:20 - the issue with iron Source where some
00:22 - misinformation spread like wildfire and
00:23 - there was no efficient clarification
00:25 - from Unity dots was constantly talked
00:27 - about and then suddenly nothing and a
00:29 - bunch more things where people felt
00:30 - Unity just was not communicating enough
00:32 - Well turns out there's actually a very
00:34 - good reason for that as you might know
00:36 - Unity went public a few years ago and
00:38 - when a company goes public there are
00:39 - tons of disclosures that have to be
00:41 - found and especially with regards to a
00:43 - merger agreement like with iron Source
00:45 - while the merger is pending they are
00:46 - extremely limited on what they can say
00:48 - publicly so apparently that caused a lot
00:50 - of UNT employees to be really scared
00:52 - about saying anything in public and
00:53 - potentially getting into trouble once I
00:55 - heard that everything suddenly became
00:56 - much more clear with that in mind the
00:58 - lack of communication definitely makes
00:59 - more sense nowadays everyone is a bit
01:02 - more clear on the rules on what they can
01:04 - and cannot say so they definitely have
01:05 - improved in terms of communication
01:06 - recently they've been doing games
01:08 - focused blog posts communicating lots of
01:10 - things they've done there's also the
01:12 - devmolites where a team from Unity
01:13 - answers every question they get dots
01:15 - getting some more communication with
01:17 - some specific timelines and so on so
01:19 - that's a pretty important piece of
01:20 - information that I learned at unite
01:21 - which really helps understand some
01:22 - things that I haven't in the past few
01:24 - years okay so unite 22 here are some of
01:27 - my highlights from the keynote the
01:28 - roadmap talk and the various other talks
01:30 - that I attended the main theme behind
01:33 - pretty much everything was essentially
01:34 - iterative Improvement based on user
01:36 - feedback from everything that I heard
01:38 - Unity is actively listening to feedback
01:40 - from every single source and acting upon
01:42 - it to make the engine better and better
01:43 - for everyone
01:44 - so starting off with the keynote it
01:46 - began with the usual bunch of stats they
01:48 - repeat these stats quite often that
01:49 - nowadays I barely pay attention but if
01:51 - you think about it these are truly
01:53 - massive and definitely worth celebrating
01:55 - Unity is used by 50 of all games
01:57 - including 70 of the top mobile games
01:59 - through all those games Unity reaches 3
02:02 - billion players that's a mind-boggling
02:04 - large number
02:05 - and in VR it also has a huge presence
02:07 - with 60 to 70 percent of top VR games
02:10 - being made with yendi when you think
02:11 - about it those numbers really are truly
02:13 - insane the keynote itself was split into
02:15 - three sections first the build section
02:17 - which covers everything Unity does to
02:19 - help you build your own games then scale
02:22 - which is how Unity helps you scale your
02:24 - game to reach millions of players with
02:25 - ease and finally Innovation which of
02:28 - course is my favorite section since the
02:29 - main thing about it is all about the
02:30 - exciting world of dots but before we get
02:33 - to that let's start from the beginning
02:34 - the build section starts off with one of
02:36 - the most important things about Unity
02:38 - how it's multi-platform you make the
02:40 - game just once and you can build it for
02:41 - dozens of platforms they are constantly
02:43 - adding more and more the most recent
02:45 - ones were Chrome OS and The Meta Quest
02:47 - Pro which just came out a few weeks ago
02:48 - for building your game you use one of
02:50 - the two render pipelines agrp if you
02:53 - want maximum visual Fidelity it
02:55 - continues getting updates making it look
02:57 - better and better and there's a bunch of
02:58 - gorgeous looking games that already
02:59 - showcase what ajrp can do and urp for
03:02 - running your game on anything while
03:04 - still making it look excellent like the
03:05 - recently released Marvel snap or Lego
03:07 - Builder's Journey they announced a
03:09 - pretty big update to the XR interaction
03:11 - token I haven't had time to touch VR
03:13 - development just yet but it's great to
03:15 - see this continuing to get more and more
03:17 - updates this song kit basically helps
03:19 - you create interactions that work on any
03:20 - VR or ar device so there's no need for
03:23 - tons of ifs to run logic depending on
03:25 - this device building your game also
03:27 - requires UI and for that UI tokit got
03:29 - another huge update this is a tool that
03:31 - I've made a bunch of research on but I
03:33 - haven't had the time to make a proper
03:34 - video tutorial just yet this tool helps
03:36 - you easily make editor tools if you've
03:38 - ever tried building tools with I am GUI
03:40 - then you know how much of a nightmare it
03:42 - is UI tonkit helps make that extremely
03:44 - easy and it has a benefit of working for
03:46 - both editor as well as for runtime UI so
03:49 - you can use the same tool for both
03:50 - although at the moment editor UI is
03:52 - already fully supported while runtime UI
03:54 - is supported but I believe it's not yet
03:56 - only production ready one of the main
03:58 - benefits of UI tonkit is the separation
04:00 - of concerns basically the way it works
04:02 - is you define the structure in one place
04:04 - then the style and another and then
04:05 - Electric in another all three of those
04:07 - things are nicely decoupled nicely
04:09 - separated which means you can greatly
04:10 - improve iteration speed you don't need
04:12 - to recompile code changes just to change
04:14 - the sound you swap out the style sheet
04:16 - and everything updates one nice benefit
04:18 - of that system is you could for example
04:20 - include multiple sounds in your game so
04:22 - perhaps in a multiplayer game with two
04:24 - teams you could very easily swap out the
04:26 - entire UI visual if playing on team a or
04:28 - Team B or you could just let the player
04:30 - choose from a bunch of UI Styles or a
04:32 - bunch more things separating the visuals
04:34 - from the structure and from the logic is
04:36 - a really interesting approach for
04:37 - building UI and it's especially useful
04:39 - if you're working on a team mixing
04:40 - programmers and designers another big
04:43 - update is how starting in unity 22.2 of
04:45 - the default TNT editor windows they're
04:47 - all now built using UI toolkit one big
04:49 - benefit of that is you can now easily
04:51 - include property drawers in your own
04:53 - custom editor since everything won't be
04:54 - using UI token coming in the future is
04:57 - also a new data binding system I must
04:59 - say this is the one part about UI
05:00 - toolkit that I filmed was needlessly
05:01 - complex so I'm definitely looking
05:03 - forward to improvements in this area
05:04 - then came one of the biggest
05:06 - announcements and it came pretty quickly
05:08 - there's a lot of people who are pretty
05:10 - frustrated with the render pipelines and
05:11 - how they are separate for me I don't
05:13 - really worry too much about it I just
05:15 - make my projects with urp and that's
05:17 - really it but still this is a pretty
05:19 - interesting announcement soon you will
05:21 - be able to have both urp and hbrp in the
05:23 - same project the main benefit of this
05:26 - would be if you have game releasing on
05:27 - both consoles and mobile you could use
05:29 - hdrp for the console build and then
05:31 - easily swap out everything for urp to
05:33 - make the mobile build another benefit
05:35 - would be if you start the game with urp
05:37 - then later on you decide that you want
05:39 - to use egrp you could then switch
05:40 - they're working on making everything
05:42 - more compatible making it easier to make
05:44 - shaders that work in both render
05:45 - pipelines so it's a pretty big deal that
05:47 - will hopefully make using and swapping
05:49 - around the pipelines much more of a
05:50 - painless process beyond that both render
05:53 - pipelines continue getting upgrades urp
05:55 - is getting foreign rendering which
05:57 - enables you to have tons of Lights
05:58 - instead of being limited to just ain't
06:00 - it also now has decal support and a
06:03 - bunch of rendering layers letting you
06:04 - place bullet holes and what's better
06:06 - throughout your home levels and a bunch
06:08 - more features as for ajrp they showcase
06:11 - an Agri sky looks really great and then
06:14 - you can also swap out for a physically
06:15 - based Sky moving direction of the light
06:18 - makes for some really gorgeous sunsets
06:19 - then on top of that you can add a bunch
06:21 - of cloud layers they are separated into
06:23 - multiple layers and you can play around
06:25 - the opacity for each one there is also a
06:27 - volumetric cloud system
06:29 - it's really gorgeous watching the clouds
06:31 - block the sunlight with some good
06:32 - looking gun rays and you can even
06:34 - animate it by turning a bright blue sky
06:36 - into dark and foggy then the water
06:38 - system which also looks excellent and
06:40 - the whole world is filled with tons of
06:42 - light probes for some gorgeous lighting
06:44 - an important thing is these are part of
06:46 - a tool called adaptive Pro volume which
06:48 - automatically places light proof 3 so
06:51 - there is no need to place them on by
06:52 - hand one by one without this if you're
06:54 - using egrp and building a realistic game
06:56 - then you can build something truly
06:58 - spectacular in just a handful of flex
06:59 - during this section one thing that I
07:01 - noticed in chat was lots of people
07:03 - questioning what is the performance in
07:04 - agrp I definitely want to give this a
07:06 - try to see just how performed it is so
07:08 - stay tuned for a quick video on that
07:10 - that makes up the build section after
07:12 - that was a scale section all about
07:14 - helping you build massive games with
07:15 - ease and excellent performance starting
07:17 - off with the X1 support being production
07:19 - ready in 22.2 the X12 has tons of
07:22 - benefits related to multi-threading and
07:24 - doing very complex work in a much more
07:26 - efficient manner especially if your game
07:28 - is CPU bound you can expect up to 30
07:30 - performance improvements that's really
07:33 - awesome for just toggling a simple
07:34 - switch this allows you to build massive
07:36 - games with huge worlds and tons of
07:38 - objects another part related to scaling
07:40 - your game is supporting it after launch
07:42 - that's where all of the ugs Tunes come
07:44 - in handy plus the SCM got a bunch of
07:47 - updates so working as a team is easier
07:49 - than ever before same thing for cloud
07:51 - build also improvements across the board
07:52 - and cloudcon delivery this is unt's
07:55 - content delivery Network or CDN which
07:57 - enables you to update a senior game
07:59 - without having to upload a brand new
08:01 - build I have a full detailed tutorial
08:03 - about how to use cloudcon delivery in my
08:05 - ultimate TNT overview course the system
08:07 - is based on addressables which I covered
08:09 - in detail in another video One recent
08:10 - example of the game using all of these
08:12 - tools is the recently released Marvel
08:13 - snap they made over 15 000 builds and
08:17 - pushed out tons of content updates some
08:19 - more useful ugs tools for scaling your
08:21 - game are remote config game overrides
08:23 - and analytics then let you do a b
08:25 - testing Define different sets and values
08:27 - that different players receive and you
08:29 - can then analyze the results again all
08:31 - of it from the ENT dashboard without
08:33 - ever having to upload a brand new build
08:34 - so you can see how all of these tools
08:36 - work together enabling you to iterate
08:38 - upon the game to make it the best it can
08:40 - be after that was the multiplayer
08:42 - section starting off with some very
08:43 - impressive stats more and more people
08:45 - are making multiplayer games and even
08:46 - more want to get certain just a few
08:48 - weeks ago they'll launched netcode for
08:50 - game objects which is their official
08:51 - multiplier solution I made one of my
08:54 - most detailed tutorials ever when it
08:55 - came out check it out if you want to
08:57 - learn how to make multiplayer games they
08:59 - mentioned their other multiplayer tools
09:01 - which I very much want to cover in
09:02 - future tutorials there's multiplay which
09:04 - is apparently now called Game Server
09:06 - hosting that's a server for creating and
09:08 - managing dedicated servers and
09:10 - Matchmaker which allows you to Define
09:11 - rules and match players with one another
09:13 - finally we get to the exciting
09:15 - Innovation section it's all about how
09:17 - Unity is innovating making tools that
09:19 - enable you to build any game you can
09:20 - imagine starting off of course with dots
09:23 - and something that I really like is how
09:25 - they turn off this section by
09:26 - highlighting V Rising which is an
09:27 - example of a game that you can already
09:29 - go playing and is already using dots so
09:32 - even though it's only hitting 1.0
09:33 - production rate in a few months it has
09:35 - already proved itself in production V
09:37 - Rising use dots to handle massive object
09:39 - streaming there are hundreds of
09:40 - thousands of interactable objects this
09:42 - would be impossible to do without dots
09:44 - another example is Zenith it's a vrmo
09:47 - which means massive amount of players
09:48 - and objects of those players need to
09:51 - update their exp whenever they kill an
09:53 - enemy or do something updating that many
09:55 - game objects every second would be
09:57 - nearly impossible so that's where dots
09:59 - really helps
10:00 - then ixion which I'm not very familiar
10:02 - with but appears to be a Sci-Fi City
10:04 - Builder on a massive scale simulating
10:06 - thousands of objects
10:07 - and finally detonation racing which is a
10:09 - mobile game that showcased a really
10:11 - awesome feature at GDC synths is all
10:14 - about determinism you can read back and
10:15 - replay sections of the game that makes
10:17 - iterating upon the game design an
10:19 - extremely easy process the big
10:21 - announcement is that version 1.0 is
10:22 - graduating from experimental into
10:24 - preview in preparation for a full
10:26 - release on the 22 LTS cycle and once
10:28 - again a very important thing is
10:30 - highlighting how you don't have to go
10:31 - full dots or phone game objects the
10:34 - answer is a hybrid workflow use game
10:36 - objects where they make sense and use
10:38 - entities where it makes sense
10:39 - I also noticed lots of excitement in
10:41 - chat when the dot section came up lots
10:44 - of people are definitely looking forward
10:45 - to it including myself I'm actually
10:46 - right now working on a mini tutorial
10:48 - just checking out the current state of
10:50 - dots then when 1.0 is finally fully
10:52 - released in 22 LTS that's when I'll
10:54 - really get busy making tons of dots
10:56 - tutorials so stay tuned for that then
10:58 - more invasion in visuals Unity picked up
11:00 - the weather tools and zip Dynamics
11:02 - they're currently hard work on making
11:04 - those work in real time and integrate
11:06 - them into the engine there's a really
11:08 - impressive hair package demo that you
11:09 - can go around and play with right now
11:11 - you can also download the digital human
11:13 - using the very impressive enemies demo
11:16 - that demo was originally made using some
11:18 - extremely high-end 4D captures but now
11:20 - they've got it working with a Ziva
11:22 - puppet I have no idea how these are
11:24 - created but you have a bunch of Sliders
11:26 - you can play around to get pretty much
11:28 - any expression you can think of and
11:30 - somehow all of this works in just 15
11:32 - megabytes so you could use this hyper
11:34 - realistic Ziva puppet for all of your
11:35 - NPCs which is pretty impressive they
11:37 - even showcase it running in real time on
11:39 - an Xbox series X the goal is to bring
11:42 - all of the super impressive tools that
11:43 - are used in super high-end Hollywood
11:44 - movies and bring them to every single
11:46 - entity developer so that's an overview
11:48 - of the keynote lots of improvements in
11:50 - pretty much every area the other very
11:53 - important Tonk was the roadmap here they
11:55 - mentioned many things that were also
11:56 - mentioned in the keynote all the awesome
11:58 - things coming out in 22.2 which is
12:00 - coming out in the next few weeks as well
12:02 - as a few weeks for further in the future
12:03 - in unity 23. again starting off by
12:06 - emphasizing feedback and how everything
12:08 - they do is based on the feedback they
12:10 - get from users like me or you lots of
12:12 - performance improvements making
12:13 - everything just a bit faster Shader
12:15 - compilation replenishing prefabs
12:17 - addressables build report which now lets
12:20 - you see more details the package manager
12:22 - also now lets you customize cash
12:24 - location pretty great if you're
12:25 - unlimited for space and also package
12:27 - signing so you can verify that you're
12:29 - grabbing the rate package one nice one
12:31 - is a plan to simplify the input system
12:33 - workflows it's a great system I've
12:35 - covered it in full detail in another
12:37 - video
12:37 - although it does require quite a handful
12:39 - steps to get it set up at first so
12:41 - simplifying that does seem great they
12:43 - showcase the memory profiler really
12:45 - awesome tool tons of stats if you have
12:47 - memory issues with your game then this
12:49 - tune will help you very quickly pinpoint
12:50 - them the Shader graph also got a full
12:53 - screen effects node previously this was
12:55 - only possible through a very hacky way
12:56 - so having a proper way of doing it is
12:58 - great adaptive proof volume which I
13:01 - mentioned a while ago this is a tool for
13:02 - helping you position light probes
13:04 - automatically instead of having to do it
13:05 - manually one by one which is definitely
13:07 - a huge help it's already available in
13:09 - hdrp and is coming to urp and 23 Ray
13:13 - tracing is also coming out of preview in
13:14 - 23.1 so that's fun really most of the
13:17 - things over here on this part of the
13:19 - roadmap talk where the same is on the
13:20 - keynote so Unity definitely took
13:22 - feedback to heart when tons of people
13:23 - were angry that the Keynotes and road
13:25 - maps were only talking about awesome
13:27 - things but there were also many many
13:29 - years in the future
13:30 - so they definitely focus on only talking
13:32 - about things that are either already out
13:33 - or just around the corner one thing that
13:36 - got quite a bit of detail is the
13:37 - multiplayer they're working on the tool
13:39 - for helping you test multiplayer games
13:40 - without having to make separate builds
13:42 - so you can run multiple instances of the
13:45 - game inside the same editor that's a
13:47 - really awesome tool extremely useful for
13:49 - testing and making multiplayer games
13:51 - another really great one is Network
13:53 - simulation it's a tool for helping you
13:55 - test out every possible multiplayer
13:57 - problem everything from like spikes
13:59 - latency and random disconnections and
14:01 - yet now that a really awesome thing is
14:02 - they are currently working on Unity
14:04 - transport 2.0 which will feature webgl
14:06 - support that is the one main limitation
14:09 - on the current version it does not work
14:10 - in webgl so seeing this is excellent
14:12 - news once again making sure that Unity
14:14 - is multi-platform and any game you make
14:16 - can be played on essentially anything
14:18 - they're also working on the ability of
14:20 - recording and playing back multiplier
14:22 - packets again super useful for testing
14:24 - as well as making it easier to support
14:26 - large persistent worlds so lots of
14:28 - detail on the multiplayer roadmap
14:30 - there were a bunch of comments in my
14:32 - multiplayer video wondering if it's safe
14:34 - to use netcode for game objects or if
14:36 - Unity won't just deprecate it soon based
14:38 - on the current state of the multiplier
14:39 - tools and everything mentioned here it
14:41 - seems very clear to me that they are in
14:42 - it for the long term then the dot
14:44 - section of the roadmap which has some
14:46 - really nice extra details once again
14:48 - everything is on track for 1.0 with 23
14:50 - LTS there are some upcoming samples
14:53 - starting off with the original one Mega
14:55 - City it's a really impressive demo they
14:57 - launched all the way back when dotsworth
14:59 - first announced now they are going to
15:01 - upgrade all of that code to dots 1.0
15:03 - this is going to be the sample that will
15:05 - showcase large scale streaming and
15:07 - subscene authoring the second demo is
15:09 - called ECS racing it's a competitive
15:11 - multiplayer game showcasing netcode for
15:13 - entities its server authoritative with
15:16 - client-side prediction interpolation and
15:18 - lag compensation and beyond that there's
15:20 - also tons of tutorials and learning
15:22 - materials showcasing best practices
15:23 - there's already a bunch of them out
15:25 - right now I'll definitely be studying
15:27 - those to learn the best practices and
15:29 - they also recently acquired the Dodge
15:30 - character controller it's an excellent
15:32 - fully feature dots character controller
15:34 - which is now available in free for
15:36 - everyone also they updated the dots and
15:38 - ECS main pages so if you want to learn a
15:41 - bunch more about dots those have quite a
15:42 - lot of info and some very helpful links
15:44 - as for the future of dots after 1.0 they
15:47 - are working on improving cross-play
15:49 - determinism to make sure that every
15:50 - single one of the platforms the unity
15:52 - supports always behaves in the exact
15:54 - same way then they are also working on
15:55 - tools for making large open World Games
15:57 - easier to build also the ECS animation
16:00 - package importantly this is going to be
16:02 - pretty much the first thing where the
16:03 - end user will never know it's using ECS
16:05 - for regular users they won't keep making
16:07 - animations as usual using Game objects
16:10 - but in the background the system will be
16:12 - using ECS to make it extremely performed
16:14 - that to me sounds like it's going to be
16:15 - one of the true tests of dots seeing how
16:18 - it improves the quality of everyone who
16:19 - uses unity and not just people using
16:21 - dots directly then for the rest of the
16:23 - roadmap there are also some new terrain
16:25 - tools coming up using splines to make
16:27 - rivers and a bunch of ways of creating
16:29 - some gorgeous environments for mobile
16:31 - there's going to be faster deployment on
16:33 - Android by doing incremental Delta
16:35 - builds also incremental Builds on
16:37 - console webgl is also getting tons of
16:40 - improvements starting with mobile
16:41 - browser support making your webgl games
16:43 - play well on the phone inside a browser
16:45 - it's getting a better memory inspector
16:48 - and perhaps best of all webgl is getting
16:50 - multi-threaded support with Native C
16:52 - plus code honestly I didn't even know
16:54 - this was possible so that's truly insane
16:56 - that coupled with the previous news that
16:58 - the network transport layer 2.0 is going
17:00 - to support webgl seems like next year is
17:02 - going to be really special for web game
17:04 - devs then a bunch more news on the xri
17:06 - toolkit how you can simulate AR devices
17:08 - in the editor XR templates and more and
17:11 - plastic sem is also getting a very
17:13 - robust web dashboard so quite a lot of
17:15 - nice improvements coming in the near
17:16 - future beyond that I entered the talk on
17:19 - Unity gaming Services I'm working on
17:20 - various tutorials for how to use those
17:22 - tools there is also a really fun talk on
17:25 - how to prototype games how your
17:26 - prototype should be set up to answer a
17:28 - specific question how prototypes can be
17:30 - cheaper and a fun technique was to make
17:32 - 20 game ideas in just 20 minutes there
17:35 - was another one on some things coming to
17:37 - version 22.2 like the splines package
17:39 - there was a nice AMA with Lauren who is
17:41 - the dots Chief at unity and a bunch more
17:44 - some of the tanks are already online and
17:46 - some will be added over the next few
17:48 - days definitely give them a look you
17:49 - will definitely learn something new so
17:51 - that was unite22 it's been a long time
17:53 - since the last unite that one was all
17:55 - the way back in 2019 so it was fun to do
17:58 - this again I got to meet some other
17:59 - Unity content creators and even one
18:01 - person who recognized me thanks for that
18:03 - I hope you're really enjoying the turn
18:04 - based strategy course the feature of
18:06 - unity is looking great I'm actively
18:08 - researching lots of these things
18:09 - especially dots I can't believe 1.0 is
18:12 - just around the corner thanks Unity for
18:14 - bringing me out to Montreal Canada was a
18:16 - lovely place and surprisingly warm thank
18:18 - you for watching and I'll see you next
18:20 - time
