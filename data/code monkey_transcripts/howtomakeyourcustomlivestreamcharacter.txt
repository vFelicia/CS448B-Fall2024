00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your codm so
00:02 - whenever I do a live stream I have a
00:04 - really nice overlay that shows all the
00:05 - people in chat I have my standard
00:07 - overlay with the characters in the
00:08 - bottom and another one where the
00:09 - characters can answer some fun quizzes I
00:11 - built this system myself and I made it
00:12 - so you can customize your own custom
00:14 - character so let's see how to do that
00:15 - it's actually relatively simple and you
00:17 - can draw whatever you want now like it
00:18 - says here the first step is to go onto
00:20 - the user page and in order for the
00:22 - customization to be applied to the
00:23 - character during a live stream for that
00:25 - need to know what YouTube account
00:26 - belongs to what character on my website
00:28 - so in order for that to work you need to
00:29 - click on on the link YouTube button or
00:31 - to link your YouTube account with the
00:32 - user page so just go up here on the top
00:34 - right corner to go to your user page and
00:36 - then click over here on the YouTube
00:38 - button in order to link your account
00:39 - this is required because otherwise
00:40 - there's no way for me to know the
00:42 - customization on the website what
00:43 - particular YouTube user relates to that
00:45 - user account on the website when that is
00:47 - done then you can click over here on
00:48 - this button to customize your character
00:50 - and yep it opens up a nice Unity webgl
00:52 - window and over here you can do some
00:53 - basic customization so change the skin
00:56 - color change the hair color change the
00:58 - hairstyle the beard the body and so on
01:01 - so modifying the basic look is super
01:02 - easy just change all of this and then
01:03 - save the changes but the more fun part
01:05 - is actually drawing the character
01:07 - yourself so for that click on this
01:08 - button over here to download a base
01:10 - texture and this opens up a URL with
01:12 - this window so just go ahead right click
01:14 - and save this image and then you can
01:16 - just open this up in some kind of image
01:17 - editing program over here I'm using
01:19 - Photoshop and then basically all you
01:20 - need to do is just draw directly inside
01:22 - of these squares so this one up here is
01:24 - the head down so that is the Sprite that
01:26 - shows up when the character is facing
01:27 - the screen then when facing right and
01:29 - it's inverted for facing left and when
01:31 - the head is pointing up then the hand
01:33 - the foot and the various body positions
01:34 - so that's really it super simple
01:36 - depending on your art skills you can
01:37 - probably draw quite a lot better than me
01:39 - and now since these characters this
01:40 - style is actually something that I've
01:41 - used in several of my own games because
01:43 - that I have a bunch of Sprites with this
01:45 - exact same format so a bunch of really
01:47 - interesting characters that I've used in
01:48 - several of my own games for example here
01:50 - is a nice ninja character I believe I
01:52 - use this one in my hyperight battles
01:53 - game so here it is and yep the only
01:55 - thing that matters is that I draw
01:56 - directly on the perfect position so if I
01:58 - place the other overlay on top notice
02:00 - how it's all drawn perfectly so over
02:02 - here is the head down head right head up
02:03 - and so on and of course you can raise
02:05 - all the bonding boxes so yep this one is
02:07 - a Sprite so I can go ahead and save this
02:09 - as a PNG and now back here on the
02:11 - website I just need to click the button
02:12 - to select a custom texture this opens up
02:14 - the file select window so I can just
02:16 - select my spray Chen and if there it is
02:17 - my character with my custom texture that
02:19 - I just drew myself now that's left is
02:21 - really just saving the changes and if
02:22 - that's it it's all done then there is a
02:24 - manual validation step I have to
02:26 - manually go into my admin page and
02:28 - validate each Sprite obviously it need
02:30 - this step otherwise my live streams
02:31 - would potentially show up with some
02:32 - really inappropriate things so if you
02:34 - customize your character just let me
02:35 - know during the live stream then I come
02:36 - here I validate the character there it
02:38 - is it's done and if then here is the
02:40 - character walking around on my live
02:41 - stream overlay with the custom texture
02:43 - that I designed and if you want to know
02:44 - how I made this how this will overlay
02:46 - how all of this works if so I actually
02:48 - made some tutorials on various parts for
02:50 - this system so the first one is these
02:52 - characters down here this is actually
02:53 - transparent TNT window so I cover that
02:55 - in this tutorial then for these
02:57 - characters these animations these are
02:59 - mesh based animation so that's what I
03:00 - covered here and again like I mentioned
03:02 - this is the same animation system that
03:03 - I've used in many of my own games then
03:05 - in order to contact from Unity with the
03:07 - YouTube API for that I covered this
03:09 - tutorial all about doing HTTP requests
03:11 - from directly inside unity and finally
03:13 - for the simple customization where it
03:15 - just changes the skin color hair color
03:17 - and so on for that one I covered how I
03:19 - handle the guest Sprite sheets in my
03:20 - game battle Ro Tycoon basically it
03:22 - involves tinting pixels of various
03:24 - colors and then copy pasting various
03:25 - parts from different Sprite sheets so
03:27 - you put all that together and here is a
03:28 - really awesome custom character that
03:29 - that you can also draw yourself in order
03:31 - to participate in my live streams so go
03:33 - ahead check the link in the description
03:34 - draw your own character and then join me
03:36 - on the next live stream
