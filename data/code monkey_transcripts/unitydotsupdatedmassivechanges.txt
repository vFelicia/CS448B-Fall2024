00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here's a quick news video unity dots
00:04 - has just received a massive update as
00:06 - you might know the last public dots
00:08 - release was over a year ago all the way
00:10 - back in 2020 since then unity have
00:12 - continued working on dots but they did
00:14 - it in private they were preparing a
00:16 - massive update which starts right now
00:17 - and is on the path to reaching 1.0 next
00:20 - year
00:20 - there's two massive blog posts with tons
00:22 - of info on this update and the future
00:24 - also a public roadmap there's links in
00:26 - the description if you want to read it
00:28 - yourself here's my quick summary but
00:30 - first if you start using unity in the
00:32 - recent months or in the last one to two
00:33 - years then you might not even know what
00:35 - is unity dots or what is ecs i made a
00:38 - video on that topic quite a long time
00:39 - ago it's an overview explanation of the
00:41 - technology stack so the video is still
00:43 - accurate also one very important thing
00:45 - just like i mentioned in that video dots
00:47 - is composed of the entity component
00:48 - system the job system and the burst
00:50 - compiler the only part of that that is
00:52 - telling preview and experimental is the
00:54 - part that got this massive update which
00:56 - is the entity component system the job
00:58 - system and burst compiler have already
00:59 - been production ready for quite some
01:01 - time that's actually one of the first
01:03 - things they mentioned in the blog post
01:04 - how ecs is still an experimental stage
01:06 - so it's not recommended for final
01:08 - production
01:09 - but the job system and the burst
01:10 - compiler those are indeed already stable
01:12 - and you can use them in production they
01:14 - mentioned the roadmap to get into
01:16 - version 1.0 first starting off with this
01:18 - release 0.5 meant for compatibility with
01:21 - unity 2020 lts
01:23 - then over the next one to three months
01:25 - we should see a quick update to 0.51
01:28 - this one will make it compatible with
01:30 - 2021 lts which should be coming out
01:32 - really soon and finally the big one
01:34 - version 1.0 compatible with the 2020
01:36 - tech stream meaning that hopefully
01:38 - version 1.0 will be production ready in
01:40 - time for the 2020 lts version which
01:42 - should come out sometime next year the
01:44 - main goal with ecs is really to enable
01:46 - more types of games to be created with
01:48 - unity and they also mentioned one
01:50 - extremely important thing that has been
01:52 - a big point of confusion to so many
01:54 - people ecs does not replace game objects
01:56 - so game objects are not being deprecated
01:58 - at all if your game ideas are already
02:01 - possible to build with game objects and
02:02 - nothing changes on that front you can
02:04 - continue to use game objects to build
02:06 - your games for many many years to come
02:08 - this is just extra technology which may
02:10 - or may not be suitable to whatever game
02:12 - you're trying to make
02:13 - they mention a handful of scenarios
02:15 - where a data oriented ecs architecture
02:17 - might be better suited than objects by
02:19 - going with a data oriented design it
02:21 - leads to better written code since you
02:23 - have to split everything up into tons of
02:25 - discrete components so one side effect
02:27 - of that is helping you be more easily
02:29 - adaptable to where your game design is
02:31 - headed since again it works with game
02:33 - objects you can just integrate ecs on
02:35 - some parts of your game that require
02:37 - extreme performance so perhaps your
02:39 - game's bottleneck is on the pathfinding
02:41 - so you could keep everything else
02:42 - exactly the same using game objects and
02:44 - just rewrite the pathfinding to use ecs
02:47 - ecs really enables extreme performance
02:49 - so that also enables you to build much
02:51 - more complex much more demanding games
02:53 - on every device imaginable so think
02:55 - something like an rts with tons of units
02:57 - or perhaps an action game with tons of
02:59 - effects or maybe an adventure game with
03:01 - tons of npcs of those examples running
03:04 - on a low-end mobile device ecs also
03:06 - enables massive data streaming so it
03:09 - lets you create some absolutely massive
03:11 - worlds and easily stream chunks in and
03:13 - out
03:13 - so think something on the scale of elton
03:15 - ring but being able to run on a mobile
03:17 - device
03:18 - you can simulate things on massive
03:20 - scales so it enables things like a
03:22 - massive universe simulation or perhaps
03:24 - something on a much smaller scale but
03:26 - with huge detail and accuracy
03:28 - multiplayer is also a big focus more
03:30 - performance means more complex
03:32 - multiplayer games with more players and
03:34 - all kinds of sync objects
03:35 - so those are just a handful of scenarios
03:37 - where ecs can enable you to build
03:39 - different experiences than just with
03:41 - game objects also in case you don't know
03:43 - gdc is starting next week and there
03:45 - won't be two tanks on games already
03:46 - using dots
03:48 - the super popular vr mmo zenith is
03:50 - apparently using it
03:52 - as well as a really cool racing mobile
03:54 - game this blog post ends with asking for
03:56 - feedback there's many ways to get in
03:58 - touch with the dot seem and again it
04:00 - ends by mentioning that the goal is to
04:01 - continue building ecs whilst keeping
04:03 - compatibility with game objects so again
04:05 - game objects are not going anywhere then
04:07 - the other blog post is on more of the
04:09 - technical details starting off with how
04:11 - the entity debugger window which had
04:13 - tons of information is now nicely split
04:15 - into several windows the profiler is
04:18 - also improved to help you set up your
04:19 - architecture in a better way and cause
04:21 - less structural changes systems have
04:23 - apparently been simplified
04:26 - there used to be quite a lot of
04:27 - boilerplate code you need to write to
04:28 - make a system so this seems like a great
04:30 - change
04:31 - netcode also got lots of upgrades
04:34 - physics predictions subscene streaming
04:36 - simpler commands and more the renderer
04:38 - also got an upgrade and now has
04:40 - compatibility with tons of shaders and
04:42 - includes multiple features from agrp and
04:44 - urp and physics and havoc also got an
04:47 - update
04:48 - finally there's the roadmap page quite a
04:50 - lot of detail on all of the changes in
04:51 - 0.5 and how to upgrade your project
04:54 - mentions how version 0.51 is coming soon
04:57 - and finally lots of info on all the
04:59 - things that are in progress for version
05:00 - 1.0 as well as other things that are in
05:03 - planning and some others just under
05:04 - consideration so this is all really
05:07 - exciting we're finally getting to see
05:08 - what unity has been working on for these
05:10 - past few years and hopefully soon enough
05:12 - we shall see all the benefits from this
05:14 - new tech now for me i'm already insanely
05:16 - busy with so many projects so i'm not
05:18 - sure if i'll be able to do any videos on
05:20 - this update but nuts is really exciting
05:22 - and i'm definitely looking forward to
05:23 - see how it develops and i'm very curious
05:25 - to see all of the completely unique
05:27 - games that this technology will enable
05:29 - in the coming years
05:30 - let me know in the comments if you're
05:31 - planning on trying it out right away or
05:33 - if you're going to wait until next year
05:34 - for version 1.0 alright hope that's
05:37 - useful check out these videos to learn
05:38 - some more thanks to these awesome
05:40 - patreon supporters for making these
05:42 - videos possible thank you for watching
05:44 - and i'll see you next time
05:49 - [Music]
05:53 - you
