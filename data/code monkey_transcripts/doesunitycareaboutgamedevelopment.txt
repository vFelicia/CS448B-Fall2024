00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and over the past couple of years
00:03 - there's been a growing sentiment that
00:05 - unity does not care about game
00:06 - development anymore especially pc and
00:08 - console indie game development or small
00:10 - scale hobby game development which is
00:12 - how unity gained a ton of popularity you
00:14 - can see this sentiment on youtube reddit
00:16 - or twitter especially when there's some
00:18 - announcement that is not directly
00:19 - related to indie game development now
00:21 - for me as someone who follows pretty
00:23 - much all ent news both big and small for
00:25 - me this sentiment only seemed very
00:27 - strange because from what i can see game
00:29 - dev and especially in the dev has always
00:31 - been and still is one of their main
00:32 - focus
00:33 - however i can also understand how for a
00:35 - more casual viewer who doesn't really
00:37 - follow every single piece of news but
00:39 - only hears the big ones from that point
00:41 - of view i can see how that sentiment
00:42 - might have grown basically the news that
00:44 - make the splash are the big ones which
00:46 - aren't directly related to game
00:47 - development or again more specifically
00:49 - indie game development which is usually
00:50 - the vocal majority on youtube twitter
00:52 - and reddit there was a big splash when
00:54 - they bought the water tools it seems
00:56 - that acquisition is mainly focusing on
00:58 - digital movie production
00:59 - there's also the ziva dynamics same
01:02 - thing more from movies than really games
01:04 - then of course the biggest splash of all
01:05 - was iron source which is actually about
01:07 - game development although it's about
01:09 - mobile game development so not exactly
01:11 - what pc and console indie game devs
01:13 - really care about so if you're a casual
01:15 - viewer and you're just reading these
01:16 - news of billion dollar acquisitions
01:18 - targeting industries other than small
01:20 - indie game development then it can
01:21 - definitely create that type of negative
01:23 - sentiment now just last week unity
01:25 - announced a really interesting new
01:26 - initiative which i believe is meant to
01:28 - directly tackle this type of sentiment
01:30 - they're calling it games focus and it's
01:32 - meant to be a recurring series to
01:33 - highlight all of the game focused things
01:35 - that unity has done and continues doing
01:37 - in this first post they talk about a lot
01:39 - of things like specifically all of the
01:41 - improvements they have made to the
01:42 - universal rendered pipeline you can read
01:45 - the entire changelog for the package to
01:46 - see how they are constantly constantly
01:48 - improving it
01:49 - so urp which is definitely very game
01:51 - focused that one is constantly getting
01:53 - updates and some pretty massive ones at
01:54 - that but again not flashy enough to be
01:56 - big news then some improvements on code
01:59 - and general iteration time which again
02:00 - is focused on anyone that used dnt
02:02 - editor which obviously includes small
02:04 - indie game devs they mentioned several
02:06 - speed ups on every single lts iteration
02:08 - and in the future they are working on
02:10 - moving the editor to the core clr this
02:12 - is a massive under the hood upgrade but
02:14 - again not really something sexy that
02:16 - gets the clicks or the headlines the ui
02:18 - toolkit is another excellent game focus
02:20 - tool that has slowly been growing in
02:21 - background i haven't made a video on it
02:23 - yet but i have done some research and it
02:25 - is a very good tool and speaking of the
02:27 - ui toolkit they just launched a brand
02:29 - new awesome sample game which you can
02:31 - download for free and inspect to see how
02:33 - it all works that's the first blog post
02:35 - on this game's focus series i definitely
02:37 - look forward to seeing more of it since
02:38 - there are so many game focused things
02:40 - that a lot of people still don't know
02:41 - about there's also the excellent
02:43 - recently released free ebook on the
02:45 - universal rhythm pipeline i made a video
02:47 - overview on this ebook it's a massive
02:49 - ebook over 120 pages all filmed with
02:51 - excellent information to help your games
02:53 - look their best
02:54 - also this is not their only ebook unity
02:56 - has made a ton of these all of them with
02:59 - tons of super useful information on all
03:00 - kinds of topics and again most of them
03:03 - are definitely focused on in the game
03:04 - development they also participated on
03:06 - the recent gamescom and used their booth
03:08 - to promote and talk about all kinds of
03:10 - awesome indie games being built with
03:11 - unity so if you make a great game with
03:14 - unity there's a chance they won't help
03:15 - you promote it which is one of the
03:16 - toughest parts of indie game development
03:18 - nowadays another really awesome
03:20 - initiative that they did a while ago is
03:22 - the devlits this is where an entire
03:24 - unity team went onto the forums and read
03:26 - it and answered a ton of questions i
03:28 - assumed myself and got some really great
03:29 - answers so this is another initiative
03:31 - that they say is the first of many with
03:33 - many other teams doing other develops in
03:35 - the future so really great idea again
03:37 - very much focused on game dev in terms
03:39 - of packages and development
03:41 - dots which is an extremely exciting tech
03:43 - that will definitely enable all kinds of
03:45 - new games to be built this one is still
03:46 - in active development
03:48 - i just made a video a while ago on the
03:49 - current state they had a pretty massive
03:51 - update a few months ago and everything
03:53 - is on track for it to be production
03:54 - rated by next year another great package
03:56 - in development is the netcode for game
03:58 - objects this is their official
04:00 - multiplayer solution again completely
04:02 - focused on in the game devs this one has
04:04 - been constantly getting updates and has
04:06 - been in 1.0 preview for several months
04:08 - so the final release should be just
04:09 - around the corner
04:11 - and it's not just a package along with
04:12 - it is a really awesome fully working
04:14 - sample of a co-op game called boss room
04:16 - which you can download to inspect and
04:18 - see how it all works something which has
04:20 - gaming in the name is unity gaming
04:22 - services which launched recently and has
04:24 - tons of tools to help indie game devs i
04:26 - also made a video when that one launched
04:28 - it's a collection of over 20 tools and
04:30 - most of them are either completely free
04:31 - or they have very generous free tiers so
04:33 - this is definitely a huge boon for indie
04:35 - game devs another awesome sample that
04:38 - exists is one to teach you about
04:39 - addressables and cloud content delivery
04:41 - this one is a really cute puzzle game
04:43 - which again you can download and inspect
04:45 - to see how it all works these two tools
04:47 - addressables and cloud delivery are
04:49 - definitely very much game focused if you
04:51 - want to learn more about them i have
04:53 - detailed lectures on them in my ultimate
04:54 - unity overview course
04:56 - every single unity version also comes
04:58 - with tons of game focused updates but
05:00 - again these don't really get the
05:01 - headlines in version 22.1 there's a 60
05:04 - improvement in importing small files as
05:06 - well as a hundred times faster undo
05:08 - operations there's a visual search query
05:11 - tool to help you find anything in your
05:12 - project there's also a spline authoring
05:15 - package then there are material variants
05:17 - there are vfx improvements a bunch of 2d
05:19 - improvements and tons more again all
05:21 - things that definitely showcase that
05:22 - they are dedicated to game development
05:24 - but again not really enticing enough to
05:26 - make a clickable headline recently they
05:28 - had a brand new free phone course on vr
05:31 - game development this is on until learn
05:33 - which is their official learning website
05:35 - this course is extremely detailed it is
05:37 - several hours long taking you from the
05:38 - absolute basics to some really complex
05:40 - vr game development again all that
05:42 - completely free in terms of interacting
05:44 - directly with the indie game dev
05:46 - community they have their twitch channel
05:47 - where they live stream and play games
05:49 - made by the community they also do
05:51 - interviews and serious deep dives with
05:53 - game developers so you can learn how
05:55 - real ent games are made and how they all
05:57 - work like recently they did a great one
05:59 - on roller drone they also had one that
06:01 - was all about teaching you how to use
06:03 - the vfx graph another great dev
06:05 - breakdown was on the wildly successful
06:07 - vrising so definitely lots of heavy game
06:10 - focused content on their twitch which
06:12 - you can use to learn to make your own
06:13 - games better then on their twitter every
06:16 - two weeks there is a dev takeover where
06:18 - one developer takes over their official
06:19 - account to post some super useful info
06:21 - and all the devs invited are very much
06:23 - related to gamedev these are always
06:25 - filled with excellent actionable info
06:27 - you can learn a super quick way so
06:29 - definitely make sure to check out their
06:31 - twitter every single tuesday for these
06:32 - unity tips accessibility in games is
06:35 - something that game players value more
06:37 - and more so to help you with that until
06:39 - launched a course that is all about
06:40 - accessibility it's on unity learn it's a
06:43 - really detailed course again all of it
06:44 - completely free and definitely focus on
06:46 - games and helping you make better more
06:48 - accessible games another excellent game
06:50 - related package is the photo mode
06:52 - this is a feature that a lot of gamers
06:54 - really enjoy they've built a very
06:56 - comprehensive photo mode which you can
06:57 - easily download and add to your games
07:00 - another excellent free game package is
07:01 - the one that i've used in so many of my
07:03 - own videos the free star assets there
07:05 - are two assets one in first person and
07:07 - one in third person they are super
07:09 - useful for very quickly getting your
07:10 - prototype up and running you just import
07:13 - the asset drag the prefab and you have a
07:14 - character working in your game either in
07:16 - first or third person super useful then
07:18 - of course there's only packages that
07:20 - have already existed for many years and
07:22 - continue being supported they continue
07:23 - being updated and improved every single
07:25 - time
07:26 - you just need to go into the package
07:27 - manager and view the last release date
07:29 - for pretty much every package
07:31 - all of these are constantly being
07:32 - updated but again that really doesn't
07:34 - make a big splash so you don't really
07:35 - hear much about it for example the 2d
07:38 - animation package got a bunch of huge
07:39 - performance boosts last year
07:41 - they made a use of bursts to massively
07:43 - improve the performance but again you
07:44 - probably didn't hear about that it just
07:46 - quietly happened in the background
07:48 - dps-importer is always constantly
07:50 - getting improvements supporting psds and
07:52 - psbs their sprite shape which is super
07:54 - awesome for making 2d games it's heavily
07:57 - used in their dragon crashers demo the
07:59 - last update was less than a month ago
08:01 - there are lots of ar packages definitely
08:03 - super useful for making air games kind
08:05 - of like pokemon go which by the way you
08:07 - might not know was actually developed in
08:08 - unity burst is one of the most amazing
08:10 - things and it is constantly improving
08:12 - and bringing those improvements to
08:13 - everything related to unity including
08:15 - any of your games cinemachine has been
08:17 - out for ages but is still getting
08:19 - updates the input system is excellent
08:21 - definitely an extremely important game
08:23 - focused feature i made a tutorial on it
08:25 - it's really excellent
08:26 - i remember the pain that i had when i
08:28 - wanted to make a game for controllers
08:29 - six years ago this package would have
08:31 - definitely made that process of making
08:33 - that game much much easier so lots of
08:35 - packages that already exist and are
08:36 - constantly getting updates but again
08:38 - those updates don't get the same level
08:39 - of press as announcing brand new
08:41 - features and of course there's the asset
08:43 - store which as i'm sure you know has
08:44 - lots of awesome assets from third-party
08:46 - developers tons of assets tools
08:48 - definitely focus on game development and
08:50 - unity is always organizing sales so you
08:51 - can pick up some of these awesome assets
08:53 - for a pretty cheap price and even better
08:55 - than cheap would be free and unity has
08:57 - their own publisher page on the ssor and
08:59 - pretty much everything here is free you
09:01 - have the ui tonkit sample a dots
09:03 - character controller 2d game kit they
09:05 - create a crit to make an rpg the really
09:07 - nice tanks tutorial
09:09 - you've got visual scripting you've got
09:10 - some really nice terrain scenes the star
09:12 - assets that i mentioned and so on they
09:14 - also have their own internal team which
09:16 - flies all over the world doing
09:17 - consulting work so giving guidance and
09:19 - helping developers make unity games then
09:22 - what that team learns from those
09:23 - developers making games is then used to
09:25 - make the engine better for everyone
09:27 - two years ago they bought the bolt asset
09:29 - they made it free for everyone and
09:30 - integrated it with the engine as the
09:32 - official visual scripting tool i use it
09:34 - in my own visual scripting course to
09:36 - make three unique games all without a
09:38 - single line of code so that's definitely
09:39 - game focused and an extremely powerful
09:41 - tool
09:42 - just recently they acquired a really
09:44 - awesome dots character controller they
09:46 - made it free already so when unity dots
09:48 - reaches 1.0 this is going to be super
09:50 - awesome and really helpful to tons of
09:51 - people
09:52 - then they also have the awesome free
09:54 - dragon crashers demo sample this one is
09:56 - an excellent resource for anyone making
09:58 - 2d games there's also all of the micro
10:01 - games so these are great for beginners
10:03 - to quickly get started with game
10:04 - development in unity there's the create
10:06 - with code course really massive full of
10:08 - tons of info for game devs and again
10:10 - completely free so based on all of this
10:12 - i really feel that the sentiment that
10:14 - unt no longer cares about game
10:15 - development i feel that is really just
10:17 - not correct
10:18 - unt is definitely committed to game
10:20 - development it's just the big headlines
10:21 - that might make it not seem that way
10:23 - just because of these initiatives all of
10:25 - these samples and tools they don't
10:27 - really get as many clicks as reporting
10:28 - on a billion-dollar merchant like i said
10:30 - for me as someone who follows all the
10:32 - news both big and small for me i never
10:34 - had a reason to doubt their commitment
10:35 - to game development when i see big news
10:38 - or only two other things like movies
10:39 - digital twins aec and so on when i see
10:42 - that i really just see them expanding
10:44 - the engine to other areas but without
10:46 - cutting back on their gaming focus that
10:48 - to me is very much a positive the more
10:50 - use case and more areas where unt is
10:52 - used then the more vulnerable it is to
10:54 - be a unity developer so that's excellent
10:55 - news for me or for you or really any
10:57 - unity developer so hopefully with this
10:59 - video you found some gamedev related
11:01 - things that unity has done that might be
11:03 - super useful for you right now that you
11:04 - might not have known about alright hope
11:06 - that's useful check out these videos to
11:08 - learn some more thanks to these awesome
11:10 - patreon supporters for making these
11:12 - videos possible thank you for watching
11:14 - and i'll see you next time
