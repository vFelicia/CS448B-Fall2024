01:10 - a great asset you've been waiting for
01:12 - then chances are it's already discounted
01:14 - also one quick note on how the sale
01:16 - works if an asset is currently on sale
01:18 - that means that it's part of the regular
01:19 - sale and not the enlightening deal so
01:22 - that means that it's safe to pick it up
01:23 - you don't need to wait until the end of
01:25 - the sale to see if that asset will later
01:27 - on get a deeper discount on your
01:28 - lightning deal
01:29 - basically if it's already on a regular
01:31 - sale then it won't be on enlightening
01:33 - deal on the other hand if something is
01:35 - currently not discounted then there's a
01:36 - chance it won't be part of a future
