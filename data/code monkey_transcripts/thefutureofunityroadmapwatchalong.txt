00:28 - e
00:58 - e
01:28 - e
01:58 - e
02:28 - e
02:36 - all right hey everyone how's it
02:39 - going hope you're having a great day so
02:43 - Unity has just released this video so
02:44 - it's a Unity 6 uh GDC road map talk so I
02:49 - figured let's watch it together I'll
02:50 - share my thoughts and we'll see we'll
02:53 - see what's the future I mean because I
02:54 - haven't seen it yet so I don't know what
02:55 - they're going to announce so this should
02:57 - be fun okay let me just unmute meet
03:00 - everything and yeah let's see if it
03:03 - should be interesting
03:08 - okay has any of you already seen it it's
03:10 - been about 3 hours so yeah all right so
03:15 - yeah Bas let's see it then if I have
03:17 - anything to say I'll pause comment and
03:19 - whatever okay so let me
03:22 - just uh put uh kind of like
03:27 - that okay great
03:34 - all right okay so yep let's put it on
03:37 - and let's
03:44 - see before we get started here's our
03:46 - Safe Harbor statement this is just a
03:49 - legal statement explaining that you
03:50 - should still do your homework when you
03:52 - choose your Tech so welcome to unity's
03:55 - developer Summit and game developer
03:57 - conference
03:58 - 2024 today I'm grateful to be able to
04:01 - present along with a very talented crew
04:03 - our road map for 2024 and maybe a bit of
04:06 - a tease to look Beyond last year we
04:09 - announced the next version of the unity
04:11 - engine Unity 6 and promised it would
04:13 - boost your productivity and give you the
04:15 - ability to create more immersive worlds
04:17 - with more players more objects more
04:19 - assets than you've been able to Target
04:21 - before for today's talk we decided to
04:24 - look at Unity 6 a little differently and
04:26 - rather than divide this talk up into
04:28 - individual products or features
04:30 - we looked at areas of game creation that
04:32 - you asked us about the most so that's
04:35 - what we'll see today oh that sound like
04:37 - a great way to set up the GDC talk right
04:40 - and by the way just in case you don't
04:41 - know uh I believe they've already uh
04:43 - released the uh preview version which I
04:46 - assume I believe it's the tech version
04:49 - learning about the new version is a bit
04:50 - tricky but I think I think uh un6 has
04:53 - already been the beta has already been
04:55 - uh around for a while and now they've
04:56 - got the preview version which I believe
04:58 - is the equivalent to the tech so I have
04:59 - to
05:00 - confirm that but yeah I think that is
05:01 - correct so yeah if you want to try out6
05:03 - yeah pretty much after this live stream
05:05 - you can go ahead download and give it a
05:07 - shot that's pretty much what I'm going
05:08 - to do but yeah let's see before we dig
05:11 - in let's take a look at what oh right
05:13 - Away Great stat 60% are using the 22 LTS
05:16 - that's really awesome yeah it's uh
05:18 - although at the same time that's 40% not
05:20 - using LTS I wonder what those are using
05:22 - I guess that's just using older LTS but
05:24 - yeah basically uh if when in doubt using
05:26 - latest LTS that's usually what you
05:29 - should do what's been happening recently
05:31 - we released Unity 22 LTS last year and
05:34 - the adoption of this latest version has
05:36 - been incredible in February more than
05:38 - 60% of all actively worked on projects
05:41 - were done so in unity 22
05:43 - LTS and what's been gratifying is that
05:46 - along with the sheer number of projects
05:48 - being worked on is the fact that we've
05:49 - also improved the quality of the engine
05:51 - in big wies and we're seeing less issues
05:54 - reported over time compared to previous
05:57 - versions we continue to release a new
05:59 - build every every two weeks and I want
06:01 - to confirm that we will support Unity 22
06:03 - LTS in production for some time to come
06:06 - ensuring that you can have the
06:08 - confidence to continue to build your
06:10 - projects until you
06:12 - launch turning our eyes towards Unity 6
06:15 - there are more than 50 major features
06:17 - being updated wow okay that's a lot of
06:20 - stuff okay so address BS lots of Android
06:23 - stuff buil profiles okay that's cool
06:24 - character hair and skin improvements
06:25 - that looks awesome crash analytics
06:27 - that's cool dedicated server that's
06:28 - awesome server host distribute to
06:30 - Authority this is really awesome for
06:31 - making multiplayer games dot swapable
06:34 - physics engines wow that's something
06:35 - physx experiment on web GP support on
06:38 - the last uh unite conference a lot of
06:40 - people were cheering for this so yeah
06:42 - this is some pretty big stuff GPU
06:44 - lightmapper a lot of GPU stuff meta web
06:47 - multiplayer oh multiplayer Center a this
06:48 - is awesome this was on the latest unite
06:51 - this is a way to put all the multiplayer
06:52 - tools together in one thing so that's
06:54 - really interesting real integration
06:56 - recording so yeah tons and tons of stuff
06:58 - they added to the editor and along with
07:01 - hundreds of minor improvements across
07:03 - the editor there are thousands of you
07:05 - using Unity 6 beta and with unity 6
07:08 - preview just around the corner fully
07:10 - supported in production you've got a
07:12 - chance to get your hands on with much of
07:14 - what we'll share with you in this talk
07:16 - in just a few weeks let's take a look at
07:19 - what some of you and other creators have
07:21 - been creating with unity this last
07:28 - year
07:32 - [Music]
07:37 - ask your questions about your dreams and
07:40 - [Applause]
07:58 - memories
08:28 - e
08:29 - [Music]
08:40 - [Music]
08:56 - wow that's really awesome every time I
08:57 - see one of these showcase the main thing
08:59 - that comes to mind is really just the
09:00 - versatility so many games all of them
09:02 - look so so awesome and so and they are
09:04 - so different like action games FPS games
09:06 - top down games asimetric games there are
09:08 - AR VR and right away valheim I haven't
09:11 - played valheim in about two years so
09:12 - yeah definitely would like to get back
09:14 - to that it's really really awesome the
09:15 - amount of variety that developers can
09:18 - build with the engines just so
09:19 - incredible to see so many different
09:21 - visual Styles genres and platforms
09:23 - represented by everyone here and I'm
09:25 - looking forward to what's next so these
09:28 - are the five topics we're going to cover
09:29 - today creating the most immersive worlds
09:31 - possible leveraging the efficient game
09:34 - creation tools our full endtoend
09:36 - multiplayer solution our platform
09:38 - support and through all of this making
09:40 - sure your games are performing great so
09:44 - with that let's dive in so we hear you
09:47 - you need to create deeply immersive
09:48 - worlds to entice your players to play
09:50 - you want the most scalable and
09:52 - efficiently rendered visuals you can get
09:54 - without sacrificing performance and you
09:56 - need ways to create worlds that draw
09:58 - even the most demanding players in we
10:00 - also learned that immersion isn't just
10:02 - Graphics it's the ability to have your
10:04 - worlds react to players in Dynamic ways
10:08 - in real time along with many other
10:09 - things so to begin I'd like to introduce
10:12 - Matthew who's going to give a rundown of
10:14 - what we're doing with a rendering
10:15 - pipelines and with speed Tre to give you
10:18 - scalable immersive
10:20 - experiences so hi everyone my name is
10:22 - Matthew Miller and I'm product manager
10:24 - for graphics now I talk about creating
10:26 - imersive worlds in the past few years uh
10:29 - we've been incrementally building our
10:32 - rendering Technologies called Script on
10:34 - the pipelines and that most of you
10:37 - already probably and we've been
10:39 - consolidating on one side the common set
10:42 - of functionalities so that we have a
10:45 - better parity across the pipelines
10:47 - improved performance
10:48 - customization visual Fidelity and artist
10:51 - tooling and on the other side we've been
10:53 - reinforcing the unique value of each
10:55 - render pipeline so for Universal render
10:57 - pipeline Studd rendering VR rendering uh
11:01 - optimize mobile performance and
11:03 - customizability and for hdrp it is uh
11:08 - improving physically based rendering and
11:11 - en so with uh all these features coming
11:15 - 6 oh it's interesting right away saying
11:17 - that the build-in render pipeline so it
11:19 - is maintained along the unity 6 cycle so
11:22 - it's actually interesting that they're
11:23 - specifically focusing on that while at
11:25 - the same time focusing on these two so
11:27 - these are going to be default un6 okay
11:28 - so yeah I wonder if they're going to
11:30 - show stats on how many how many
11:32 - developers are using urp versus uh the
11:34 - bued runer pipeline because last time I
11:36 - saw those stats those were still like s
11:38 - like only 50% using urp orrp and S like
11:40 - 50% on the build and run pipeline so I
11:42 - wonder by making that default I wonder
11:44 - if that is going to change in the future
11:46 - but yeah interesting we think that srps
11:49 - are the right place to start with your
11:51 - project so there will be defaults in
11:54 - unit6 and the buil-in render by planine
11:57 - uh buil-in render will be still
11:59 - available and maintain all along the n6
12:02 - cycle uh which will be a longer cycle
12:05 - than the classical LS oh that's also an
12:08 - interesting one longer than the cor TTS
12:10 - I don't think they've mentioned what is
12:11 - in the future because now since they've
12:13 - gone away from the number scheme so we
12:14 - can expect we can no longer expect a new
12:17 - Unity version every single year so I
12:19 - wonder so this thing longer than current
12:21 - LTS so I wonder if Unity 7 is going to
12:23 - be like I don't know 2026 2027 so yeah
12:26 - interesting to see this little hint so
12:29 - on Steam oh um in like 90% of the games
12:34 - that were shied released in 2023 already
12:37 - use srps uh a third hdrp and third urp
12:42 - for 3D games that I served for urp oh
12:46 - okay so it's already at 90% I thought it
12:48 - was quite a bit less okay so only 10%
12:50 - are using built-in okay so that's
12:51 - interesting I'm pretty sure I've seen
12:53 - these numbers before it was like 50 so I
12:55 - wonder is that a huge boost or am I just
12:57 - misremembering it I don't know but
12:58 - that's and more than 50% uh of the XR
13:03 - and mobile games also use this it's
13:06 - based on all this production feedback
13:08 - that we've been shaping uh 22 LTS and
13:13 - community6 but being used in production
13:15 - doesn't mean it's easy to learn so we
13:17 - wanted to provide you with uh all the
13:19 - materials to get started so first it's a
13:21 - ur3 samples uh they are available the
13:25 - unity up directly and it's four scenes
13:28 - with four visual side to get you uh
13:31 - started to be able to deploy a wide
13:33 - range of platforms from XR mobile to PC
13:37 - then it's a 2d happy harvest project
13:40 - showcasing 2D lighting 2D shadow style
13:42 - maps and a lot of the urp Tod renderer
13:46 - features and finally because building a
13:48 - game is a lot about
13:50 - customization uh each of our rendering
13:53 - package contain samples that you can
13:55 - find on the package manager in the
13:57 - editor with a lot of examples of custom
14:00 - Shad graph custom bfx render passes lens
14:04 - players but over all the features yeah
14:08 - and by the way all of those are
14:10 - downloadable so if you haven't seen any
14:12 - of these definitely go ahead and check
14:13 - it out I believe they're all available
14:14 - from the unity Hub so the urp scene
14:16 - sample this one is really awesome has
14:17 - tons of interesting scenes all with
14:19 - different rendering so this really great
14:20 - if you're into 2D the happy harvest I
14:22 - hav made an overview on this project
14:24 - this is all really awesome and the
14:25 - samples is something that I've been
14:27 - meaning to look at for ages cuz it looks
14:28 - like it has a lot of really interesting
14:30 - graphic stuff so yeah if you're
14:31 - interested in any of these these are all
14:33 - downloadable stuff so definitely check
14:34 - it out afterwards R passes lens players
14:38 - but over all the features uh performance
14:41 - is always the number one user request if
14:45 - you've not watched it yet we I recommend
14:48 - watching the keynote uh from unite 2023
14:52 - and in particular uh the fantasy Kingdom
14:55 - demo in unity 6 where it's showcasing uh
14:58 - the the performance improvements that
15:00 - we're bringing by the way um we spent
15:05 - more uh like the majority of our
15:08 - development resources uh on improving
15:11 - performance and it we we have three
15:15 - groundbreaking advancement the first one
15:17 - is the GPU resident drawer which totally
15:20 - changes the way that we are processing
15:22 - the scene and sending it to the GPU so
15:27 - uh we Leverage paration on the CPU and
15:30 - we store it into buffers so that it's
15:32 - stored uh and it processed directly on
15:34 - the
15:35 - GPU um and since the sces are now more
15:39 - processed on the GPU we could add GPU
15:41 - occlusion coding which will discard uh
15:43 - automatically at each frame the
15:45 - nonvisible geometry and finally to be
15:47 - able to render at 4K or with high
15:50 - shading quality or post processing
15:51 - quality on mobile uh we are introducing
15:54 - our own crossplatform temporal post
15:57 - processing uh Ator um which is called
16:01 - STP for special temporal post processing
16:04 - and this allows to render at a small
16:06 - percentage of the frame resolution and
16:08 - upscale is a final resolution with a
16:11 - little L of visual FID yeah these three
16:16 - things are really awesome I mean I am
16:18 - not a graphics program so I'll have
16:19 - anything in which I just take a button
16:21 - and everything runs 100% faster so these
16:23 - are really awesome the GPU resident
16:25 - drawer these showed some really insane
16:26 - results back when they showed it on un6
16:29 - at unite last year same thing for the
16:31 - GPU cusion calling and on STP in case
16:33 - you don't know this is an upscaler so
16:35 - basically you can render your game at
16:36 - let's say half or quarter resolution
16:38 - then basically Auto UPS uh upscales the
16:41 - the entire image up to 4K or 1080p
16:43 - something like that and basically it
16:45 - looks really awesome so yeah all these
16:46 - three are basically things that you can
16:48 - just take one box and your game runs
16:50 - much faster personally as someone who is
16:51 - not a graphics program these are the
16:53 - kind of features that I definitely love
16:55 - to see take one box everything runs
16:56 - faster awesome uh in unity uh
17:00 - extensibility is key so we uh we wanted
17:06 - to mix extensibility with performance
17:08 - and sometime it can be challenging and
17:10 - that's what Rog graph is for uh so the
17:13 - urp that's what the urp Rog graph is for
17:16 - so the randog graph allows to order uh
17:20 - the random passes so that uh you can
17:23 - optimize the memory usage which
17:26 - optimizes the memory bandwidth as well
17:28 - for better per per and but also for uh
17:32 - improving uh the battery consumption
17:35 - which is very important for mobile but
17:37 - it's also yeah that's another thing by
17:39 - the way which is if you improve
17:40 - performance not only does your game run
17:42 - faster if you cap the frame rate that it
17:44 - either you make it run faster you make
17:46 - it take less power which in terms of
17:47 - mobile means it's uh uses up less
17:49 - battery so it lasts longer so even if
17:51 - you don't like even if you don't need
17:53 - Extreme Performance then it still
17:55 - benefits you if you're making mobile
17:56 - games and need battery uh okay
17:58 - customizability framework so you can uh
18:01 - extend the pipeline through yourp uh
18:05 - runner bath uh while leveraging these
18:07 - low level
18:08 - optimizations now it's also easy for
18:12 - technical artists to extend the PIP
18:14 - planine uh with SH graph and create
18:17 - their own custom post process effect for
18:19 - example and for bfx artist they are not
18:21 - limited to the set of nodes and blocks
18:24 - that we are providing with vxb because
18:26 - now they can create custom hlsl blocks
18:28 - to create their own system for example
18:31 - blogs or custom
18:34 - simulations but extending and optimizing
18:38 - requires uh good tooling we provide
18:40 - already a lot of tools but we're
18:42 - introducing three um more tools the
18:45 - first one is a run bar view so that you
18:47 - can monitor the different R passes like
18:49 - the full uh rendering framework is
18:52 - available now you can see it in this
18:54 - tool and you can monitor as well uh the
18:57 - memory and the frame resources usage
19:01 - then uh yeah so basically this not this
19:03 - one I believe it's a brand new view
19:05 - because they've had the the frame
19:06 - debuger for quite a while that shows you
19:08 - all the steps that render the scene and
19:10 - I believe this one is more organized by
19:11 - each render pass so I believe it's like
19:13 - a an upgrade on that one so it should be
19:15 - really interesting how basically you can
19:16 - see each render pass what it is doing
19:18 - especially if you have custom render
19:19 - pass you want to see how long that
19:21 - specific render pass is taking so rather
19:23 - than just seeing the order seeing how
19:24 - long so in terms of optimizing for
19:26 - graphics it should be quite useful the
19:28 - Shad graph heat map and the VFX graph
19:31 - profiling tools allow to profile and
19:34 - optimize inside a Shader or inside a
19:37 - VF on the visual Fidelity side um we uh
19:41 - one groundbreaking advancement is
19:43 - adaptive Pro volumes or apvs and it's a
19:46 - system uh for Global elimination that
19:49 - works across a wide wch of platforms and
19:51 - scales very well so it's a prob based
19:54 - system of like pre-baked in the editor
19:58 - with automatic placement for fast
20:00 - iteration and per vtex or per pixel
20:03 - lighting for great visual quality and uh
20:08 - and performance this is definitely the
20:10 - the number one feature that I'm looking
20:12 - forward to Adaptive for volumes this
20:14 - basically uh basically real time Global
20:16 - illumination and it's a way technically
20:18 - I think it's not real time technically
20:20 - because you need uh probes and you need
20:21 - to bake them but I think you can make
20:23 - them real time I think so I'm not not
20:25 - 100% sure but basically you can just
20:27 - again take a box and automatically place
20:29 - all the probes so you don't have to
20:30 - manually place the probes it baks them
20:32 - all and everything gets some really
20:34 - gorgeous uh Global illumination so this
20:36 - definitely one of the main features that
20:37 - I'm definitely looking out for it also
20:39 - supports large worlds uh with an
20:42 - integrated streaming system and supports
20:44 - different lighting scenarios and Sky
20:47 - occlusion and so that you can as well
20:49 - create a different time of the day or
20:52 - blend between them and having a
20:54 - continuous time of and both uh adaptive
20:58 - Pro volumes and the classical light Maps
21:00 - now rely on a newly architectural light
21:05 - Baker which is lever leveraging the GPU
21:08 - while still uh running on machines with
21:11 - only two gabt of uh GPU memory so that
21:15 - you have better accessibility one I
21:19 - baking and while getting the performance
21:22 - for the environment artists when you
21:24 - want to create a the high DT environment
21:30 - uh most of like most of the time you
21:32 - need to have good sky and good water so
21:35 - we introduced a new new water system in
21:38 - hdrb
21:39 - 2020s and we are uh wrapping up uh this
21:43 - system with new features uh with
21:45 - currents for generator deformers
21:49 - excluders as well as uh better line
21:52 - rendering water light rendering and it's
21:54 - all very easy to use thanks to the
21:56 - samples in the package manager the demos
21:59 - that we are providing as
22:00 - well ah this one looked really awesome I
22:03 - was waiting for for him to say and now
22:04 - it's also available on urp but it didn't
22:06 - say that so yeah I think that that
22:08 - really awesome water system is still
22:09 - just for agrp which kind of sucks but I
22:12 - get it because it looks really gorgeous
22:13 - so yeah I guess it must need some
22:15 - specific hrp features and for the sky uh
22:18 - we wanted to add the support of time of
22:21 - day as we mentioned already for apbs so
22:24 - we added night sky we improved sunset
22:26 - and sunrise I think was a mayor
22:29 - and uh improve the atmospher atmospheric
22:32 - scattering quality and performance by
22:34 - adding it directly into the sky system
22:36 - so that it works uh at longer distance
22:39 - than other the clouds as well so then
22:42 - you need to populate this world and
22:44 - often you need a lot of vegetation and
22:46 - bance of this ve
22:48 - vegetation um so we read this 39.5 last
22:53 - year with new tools for example the
22:55 - front sections which allows to
22:56 - procedurally uh generate viance of
22:59 - leaves or with a cutout idor to better
23:02 - uh process your um your texture atlases
23:07 - uh or the projectile system which for
23:09 - example to project mushrooms as we see
23:11 - on the image or snow on top of your
23:14 - vegetation and it's all uh well
23:16 - integrated in nt6 there is a new
23:19 - importer uh which directly allows to
23:22 - load uh the speed 39 files and assets
23:26 - and we improve as well performance so
23:28 - you can more vegetation at runtime
23:30 - thanks to integrating speed Tre into the
23:33 - GPU resident drawer that I was
23:35 - mentioning previously and the
23:37 - integration of the speit 29 game win
23:39 - system which entirely runs on the GPU so
23:43 - we are already working on spit 10 which
23:46 - we be uh releasing later this year with
23:49 - again more tools uh to create more
23:51 - organic options such as admin spine
23:54 - tools for example or more procedural
23:57 - workflows so that you can trim and shape
24:00 - your trees and all this is coming uh in
24:04 - a a new editor with a better ux and
24:07 - modernized ux uh for Speed Tre so with
24:10 - this uh I speed Tre is always an amazing
24:13 - thing like I I can't believe there's
24:15 - such a complex program just to make
24:16 - vegetation but it makes sense because so
24:18 - many games have so many trees but yeah
24:20 - it's something that is really really
24:21 - impressive to results that it makes but
24:23 - yeah something that in my case for
24:24 - making tiny IND the games doesn't
24:26 - doesn't really make much sense for my
24:28 - kind of work but I'm always amazed to
24:29 - see all the kinds of things like uh
24:31 - dragging something in order to cut the
24:32 - tree so it's always a fascinating tool
24:34 - it's really awesome to see how a two for
24:37 - such a supposedly somewhat Niche case
24:39 - but it's really insanely Advanced yeah
24:41 - really interesting Works uh for me Tre
24:44 - so with this uh I give the mic back to
24:48 - inro thanks Matthew speaking of
24:51 - generating immersive worlds we have to
24:53 - talk about the newest Unity product that
24:55 - launched last year Unity Muse Unity Muse
24:58 - is a suite of generative AI capabilities
25:00 - that allow you to generate original and
25:02 - copyright free Assets in editor thanks
25:05 - to our custombuilt responsibly trained
25:08 - model and as we continue to improve the
25:10 - underlying AI models you'll start to see
25:12 - better quality Sprite generation and
25:14 - more accurately stylized 2D images you
25:17 - may have already seen that we recently
25:19 - updated our Muse's texture model to
25:21 - provide better output quality
25:23 - state-of-the-art material generation and
25:24 - more texture options and something we're
25:27 - really excited about are the 3D texture
25:29 - improvements that are shipping later
25:31 - this year or a yeah all of these uh the
25:34 - main thing that I'm interested in is
25:36 - over there improving Sprites because the
25:37 - first time that I used M Sprite Which
25:39 - was I don't know like six months ago so
25:41 - really early on I was definitely not
25:42 - very impressed with the Sprite tool so
25:44 - I'm happy to see that they're focused on
25:45 - quality while at the same time like you
25:47 - mentioned focused on not having issues
25:49 - with copyright so they're maintaining
25:50 - that thing so definitely happy to see
25:51 - that and this one over here the uh Muse
25:54 - texture this one has already improved
25:55 - quite significantly they made a blog
25:58 - post a few a few weeks ago a few days
25:59 - ago on talking about the improvements of
26:01 - muse texture from like version 1.0 from
26:04 - like 6 months ago to now version 2.0 or
26:07 - something and it did have some
26:08 - significant improvements so I'm
26:09 - definitely hoping for those same
26:10 - improvements apply to Sprite because
26:12 - usually Sprite that's what makes more
26:13 - sense to me and texture 3D I saw this
26:15 - one but I'm not a 3D modelist so I don't
26:17 - know specifically what this is it does
26:19 - look impressive like you give it a a 3D
26:21 - model and basically generates and
26:23 - applies the texture exactly what it
26:25 - should be so I'm not too sure but if any
26:26 - of you are 3D modelist I'm definitely
26:28 - curious to see just how useful this uh
26:31 - this little tool is because does seem
26:32 - the results at least seem quite good AI
26:34 - research team has pioneered a better way
26:37 - to create high resolution PBR textures
26:39 - from a prompt an input geometry or
26:42 - reference images and with this
26:43 - technology you can Auto texture full 3d
26:46 - assets with multiple PBR materials in a
26:49 - meaningful and controllable
26:51 - way and Beyond generating art we know
26:54 - that prototyping immers of Worlds with
26:56 - AI needs more than just St imagery to
26:59 - set up interactions Muse Behavior allows
27:01 - you to build decision trees in editor
27:03 - and provides AI to automatically
27:05 - generate the code needed to set up
27:07 - interaction behaviors to make the most
27:10 - of these interactions and motions Muse
27:12 - animate allows you to turn text prompts
27:14 - into animations that can be applied to
27:16 - humanoid characters we're also working
27:18 - on a new model for even more realistic
27:21 - actions and the ability to turn sketches
27:23 - and videos into character
27:25 - animations say all three these do sound
27:28 - extremely interesting I mean the
27:29 - behavior one for me personally I don't
27:31 - necessarily think so but I think for a
27:32 - lot of people especially less program
27:34 - personally I like to make simple St
27:36 - animation State uh ah State machines
27:39 - using Code so for me not really all that
27:41 - but I do believe that one you can
27:43 - generate and then convert into C code so
27:45 - that might be interesting but personally
27:46 - the one that I'm really interested in is
27:48 - Muse animate I mean there are so many
27:49 - cases in which you want to make a quick
27:51 - prototype and it's even if the accur has
27:53 - tons and tons of Animation it takes a
27:55 - lot of time in order to browse those
27:56 - animations and find the specific one you
27:57 - want so this one in order to quickly
27:59 - generate uh animations from text this
28:01 - one I'm really looking forward to and
28:03 - sound effects this one looks really
28:04 - awesome I mean I think this is the first
28:05 - time there they're announcing yet
28:07 - another texture to their yet another
28:09 - tool to their Muse tool stack so yeah
28:11 - generating sound effects I'd be curious
28:13 - to see what are the results on this yeah
28:15 - and lastly we can't forget the audio
28:17 - coming later this year Muse will allow
28:19 - for AI generated promp to sound effects
28:22 - such as movement and environmental
28:25 - science on the topic of AI let's get
28:27 - more advanced with centus centus is our
28:30 - neural engine that unlocks new
28:31 - previously impossible features in unity
28:34 - games because it enables you to run and
28:36 - import AI models you can hook it up once
28:39 - and deploy to any runtime Unity
28:42 - supported platform and we see it
28:44 - becoming an indispensable component of
28:46 - the engine just take a look at pleno a
28:48 - new and quirky game that uses Advanced
28:50 - gesture detection powered by AI models
28:53 - running on centus to unlock really
28:54 - unique interactions this deeper level of
28:57 - interaction creates a truly Dynamic
29:00 - environment so you by the way CES in
29:03 - case you don't know this is their uh
29:04 - tool for running uh inference engines
29:07 - directly on device so you don't need to
29:09 - uh like contact like with cat GPT you
29:11 - need to contact the open AI servers in
29:13 - order to make it work whereas this one
29:14 - does not need the Internet or anything
29:16 - at all so every time that I see send
29:17 - this I'm always amazed to see the
29:20 - potential that it could have but I'm
29:21 - still waiting to see some kind of killer
29:23 - app this one does seem quite interesting
29:25 - although very Niche being able to use
29:27 - machine learning in order to have
29:29 - gesture detection for finding all kinds
29:31 - of things so yeah it's a always
29:33 - interested in this to but still waiting
29:35 - to see some kind of killer app deeper
29:37 - level of interaction creates a truly
29:39 - Dynamic
29:40 - environment so you've created the world
29:42 - you're going to immerse your players in
29:44 - but you need the actual gameplay too and
29:46 - the user experience and doing it all as
29:49 - efficiently as possible including
29:51 - helping you and your team work better
29:53 - together productivity upgrades we've
29:55 - made across Unity 6 Empower you to
29:57 - create faster and more efficiently even
30:00 - with the additional functionality you'll
30:01 - see this week and we hear that creating
30:04 - these kinds of deeply immersive and
30:06 - engaging games you strive for often
30:08 - needs the ability to work together in a
30:11 - streamlined manner so I'd like to
30:13 - introduce Simon who's going to walk
30:15 - through some of the improvements we've
30:16 - made in this
30:18 - area absolutely but before we get into
30:20 - the shiny new tools and workflows we've
30:23 - also been working hard on the basics
30:25 - we're delivering many ways to get
30:27 - started and work faster on game projects
30:30 - on top of the new samples for urp that
30:32 - you've already heard about we're adding
30:33 - new presets on what we call project-wide
30:35 - actions in the input system package so
30:38 - that you don't have to keep setting up
30:40 - wsd again and
30:42 - again we're also introducing new tools
30:45 - to profile the job system better and to
30:48 - help you understand complex dependencies
30:50 - between many threads and jobs
30:52 - addressables are also getting better
30:54 - presets and platform defaults to save
30:56 - with repetitive setup tasks for asset
30:59 - bundles oh okay so all of these project
31:02 - wide input action I have to say whenever
31:04 - I do some kind of prototype I still use
31:06 - the input manager just because it is so
31:08 - easy to use you literally just write one
31:09 - line of code and works so yeah this one
31:11 - making it much easier to get started
31:13 - with the input system this could be a
31:15 - nice one maybe I'll start using that one
31:17 - even on prototypes if it if it comes
31:18 - with a with a preset thing that is
31:20 - already already handled by default that
31:22 - would be nice and yeah jobs profiling
31:23 - that is always nice cuz that one is
31:24 - always a little bit tricky and
31:26 - addressables haven't used them for a
31:27 - while but yeah well great tiny things to
31:30 - platform defaults to save with
31:31 - repetitive setup tasks for asset bundles
31:34 - and now for real step change AI offers
31:38 - great potential to assist you and your
31:39 - teams with basic tasks and use machine
31:42 - learning powered tools to get you to
31:43 - Solutions faster chat Sprite texture
31:48 - behavior and animate will all be
31:50 - available in Editor to complement your
31:52 - existing workflows oh right away that
31:55 - that is excellent news cuz it was always
31:57 - annoying always very strange how Muse
31:59 - chat you had to go outside into an
32:00 - external website so being able to have
32:02 - that in the editor that is definitely
32:04 - really awesome so right away really
32:05 - great Improvement as Muse continues to
32:08 - improve and expand you'll see these take
32:10 - on more in editor tasks with deeper
32:13 - integration one very exciting example of
32:16 - this is Muse chat with chat moving in
32:19 - editor it is becoming more project aware
32:22 - this means that soon you'll start to see
32:23 - responses Solutions and generated code
32:26 - that are directly tailored to your
32:27 - project
32:28 - there's also a whole ecosystem okay so
32:31 - that sounds really interesting putting
32:33 - uh Muse chat directly inside the editor
32:35 - and giving it information I'm very
32:36 - curious to see how exactly this one work
32:38 - so can I just say okay I'm trying to
32:40 - build a health system tell me how I
32:42 - would integrate on this complex project
32:44 - that is already built so that sounds
32:46 - very interesting I'm very curious to to
32:47 - test out the limits of just how project
32:49 - the where it is but right away sounds
32:51 - really good system of amazing AI
32:53 - Solutions out there and for trusted
32:56 - solutions that you want to use in your
32:57 - project access is going to be easier in
33:00 - the editor context via the Muse
33:02 - infrastructure so we're helping bring
33:04 - helpful AI Solutions closer to where you
33:07 - work today with all this new content
33:09 - you'll also need a better way to manage
33:11 - all these assets enter Unity Cloud Unity
33:15 - cloud centralizes content and
33:17 - streamlines workflows with connections
33:19 - between Unity asset manager Unity
33:21 - Version Control and the unity editor
33:23 - itself helping your team to create
33:26 - better games FAS and with less of a
33:28 - headache Unity asset manager provides a
33:31 - central asset repository for your studio
33:33 - to store organize discover and deploy
33:36 - content directly into Unity projects
33:39 - Unity Version Control provides Source
33:41 - control that handles large 3D files
33:44 - without uh any challenges of agility uh
33:47 - providing artists and developers with
33:49 - their own specific workflows to keep
33:51 - development moving Unity Cloud connects
33:53 - all these tools to the unity editor
33:55 - eliminating the time that's wasted
33:57 - currently switching between different
33:59 - applications searching for Content or
34:01 - trying to figure out who on Earth has
34:02 - that texture via slack or em oh right
34:06 - away those so these are not really tools
34:09 - that I use myself since I'm really just
34:11 - a solo IND developer so I really don't
34:12 - need these kinds of things but it's
34:13 - really awesome for for teams but more
34:15 - specifically I really like uh what he
34:17 - said specifically which is the goal is
34:19 - to put all these tools directly inside
34:20 - the editor so you don't have to
34:21 - constantly alab between going into
34:23 - different tools so even if I don't use
34:25 - this I I really like I really like that
34:27 - uh uh that way that Unity is going of
34:30 - trying to integrate everything into the
34:31 - editor making everything much more
34:32 - seamless I quite like that content we're
34:35 - trying to figure out who on Earth has
34:36 - that texture via slack or email as a
34:40 - preview of what's coming next in unity
34:42 - Cloud this year we'll continue to roll
34:44 - out new features from Unity asset
34:46 - manager such as versioning custom asset
34:50 - statuses to help you with complex
34:52 - pipelines broadcast editing and the
34:54 - ability to add comments and annotations
34:57 - also Al a new feature that enables users
35:00 - to track asset dependencies directly on
35:02 - the dashboard allowing you to improve
35:04 - your collaboration
35:06 - workflows we'll also remain focused on
35:09 - developing deeper Integrations with the
35:10 - unity editor and with unity Version
35:12 - Control to make it easier for teams to
35:15 - work together across projects and
35:16 - pipelines and rounding back on Graphics
35:19 - we've made it easier to create VFX and
35:22 - custom shaders to bring unique styles to
35:24 - your games many of you use Shader graph
35:28 - and VFX graph for multiple hours on a
35:30 - daily basis we're improving the user
35:33 - experience with tons of keyboard
35:34 - shortcuts for both better management of
35:36 - properties and keywords and faster undo
35:38 - Redo for Shader graph and improving
35:41 - attribut spackboard and node search for
35:43 - VFX graph the new VFX graph template
35:46 - system allows you to create a new effect
35:48 - faster and make it easier to share your
35:50 - own VFX library with the rest of your
35:52 - team oh wow I I quite like that one
35:55 - about having various presets for VFS
35:57 - effect ref that sounds really awesome
35:59 - cuz there are so many times in which I'm
36:00 - making a brand new project for some kind
36:02 - of tutorial that I want to make and I
36:03 - want to make some kind of explosions
36:04 - with particles and I always have to
36:06 - rebound that from scratch because I
36:08 - never have I've never really prepared my
36:09 - own Library so having these templates
36:11 - these sound really awesome and all these
36:12 - improvements again tiny things that make
36:14 - you work quite a lot better so yeah I'm
36:17 - I'm quite a big fan of this section of
36:19 - the road map so far effect faster and
36:21 - make it easier to share your own VFX
36:23 - library with the rest of your team we
36:25 - didn't just stop a quality of life
36:27 - either for VFX uh or at smoothing the
36:30 - learning curve we've also added new
36:32 - features that let UI artists use Shader
36:35 - graph to create Dynamic and responsive
36:37 - UI Styles and visual effects artists
36:40 - take full advantage of VFX graph with
36:42 - the urp rendering Pipeline and to round
36:45 - out this chapter on more efficient
36:46 - tooling let's look back at Ai and talk
36:49 - about improvements we're making around
36:51 - cenus now not everyone is an ml expert
36:55 - so we're working to make centus more
36:57 - accessible
36:58 - in January we launched an integration
37:00 - with hugging face tagging models that we
37:03 - we've validated with unity centers and
37:05 - pre-con converting them to the centus
37:07 - format you can import them directly into
37:09 - the editor and they just work of course
37:12 - there are also seear samples to go along
37:14 - with
37:15 - these if you do want to tweak your
37:18 - models for performance or capabilities
37:20 - or maybe you are an ml expert we've got
37:22 - a graph tool to help make that more
37:24 - efficient as
37:25 - well in-game models have to run fast
37:28 - hitting 100 plus frame rate targets uh
37:30 - even with relatively low GPU budgets
37:33 - chances are you might have used all the
37:34 - GPU for some of those fancy rendering
37:36 - features we showed you earlier to speed
37:39 - up inference we are supporting the new
37:41 - neural chipsets if your end users have a
37:45 - neural processing unit on their device
37:47 - then STIs will automatically take
37:49 - advantage of that extra compute and last
37:52 - oh that sounds quite interesting so
37:53 - basically I wonder how many devices are
37:56 - uh have those kinds of neuron chips I
37:58 - don't think they're they're quite that
38:00 - available just yet but basically for the
38:02 - future and sounds really interesting and
38:04 - really awesome is over here the hugging
38:05 - face integration with unity sent Stacks
38:07 - that one sounds really awesome because I
38:08 - have I've brows hugging face but I
38:10 - haven't really use it too much so it all
38:12 - seems quite a bit uh complicated machine
38:14 - learning is always very complex so yeah
38:16 - having something where I can just see
38:17 - okay this just works just plug in play
38:19 - download this model make it work that
38:20 - sounds like a really great Improvement
38:22 - to make sence much easier to use lastly
38:24 - we recently added quantization support
38:27 - which converts huge model weights from
38:29 - high Precision floating Point 32bit
38:31 - values down to much smaller int8 values
38:35 - uh and other variants in between this
38:37 - can cut down memory usage and compute
38:39 - time sometimes as much as four times you
38:42 - can kind of think of this as being a
38:43 - little bit like LOD but for yourl and
38:46 - with that I'll hand it back to Andrew
38:48 - immersive worlds check Dynamic AI
38:51 - controlled entities check streamlined
38:53 - workflows and great gameplay check the
38:55 - next step is to ensure your game lives
38:58 - on post launch and a critical factor in
39:01 - success is to drive deep player
39:03 - engagement that includes making sure
39:05 - your game delivers on what player
39:07 - players today expect and it's no
39:09 - surprise that one thing you've asked for
39:11 - is a better multiplayer creation
39:13 - experience unity's fully endtoend
39:15 - multiplayer solution has become even
39:18 - more robust over the last year and with
39:20 - unity 6 it's a powerful way of
39:22 - efficiently setting up a variety of
39:24 - multiplayer formats and features
39:26 - including leader towards matchmaking and
39:28 - more let's welcome Diana to tell us more
39:33 - hi my name is Diana and I'm leading
39:36 - product for Unity gaming Services Unity
39:39 - has many solutions to help with a
39:41 - variety of multiplayer game needs uh
39:43 - we're working on a series of templates
39:45 - to get you started but we also
39:47 - understand you often have to navigate
39:49 - technical choices later in the game when
39:51 - it's time to introduce multiplayer
39:53 - Concepts to your project to help with
39:55 - this situation we're working on a
39:57 - central location in the editor named
39:59 - multiplayer Center where you can play
40:02 - with the parameters of your multiplayer
40:03 - goals and see what are the recommended
40:05 - tools services or educational materials
40:07 - relevant to your project at this point
40:10 - you can add some of those directly to
40:11 - your project and start experimenting
40:13 - with those multiplayer capabilities
40:15 - immediately this multiplayer player
40:17 - Center this one something that they
40:19 - showed in the last un night and I was
40:20 - really impressed by it and I'm still I
40:22 - still want to see how it's going to go
40:24 - because does seem like something really
40:25 - awesome cuz sometimes multiplier can can
40:27 - be very uh very intimidating because of
40:30 - how many tools how many assets how many
40:31 - packages you have to install so having
40:33 - something in which pre-selects all the
40:35 - options you just select the template and
40:36 - it automatically installs everything I
40:38 - think that is really going to help all
40:40 - kinds of people get started making
40:41 - multiplayer games so I quite like that
40:43 - one once you have a working gameplay the
40:46 - very next step is to try out multiple
40:48 - clients to get a feel of the experience
40:50 - using separated processes this is what
40:52 - multiplayer play mode will deliver it
40:55 - enables multiple editor instances of
40:57 - client cents along with server to be
40:59 - open simultaneously on the same device
41:01 - using the same source code uh same
41:04 - assets on the disk providing a more
41:05 - efficient and quick development cycle of
41:07 - multiplayer games yeah this one is
41:10 - really awesome because when trying to
41:11 - make multiplayer games having to
41:12 - constantly make a build especially when
41:14 - it's a complex game like when I was
41:15 - making my game d Guardians near the end
41:17 - development making a build did take
41:18 - quite some time so having this one where
41:20 - it just basically spawns a new Unity
41:22 - editor interface this one is really
41:24 - awesome definitely once again really
41:26 - speeds up iteration with which is
41:27 - extremely important especially in
41:28 - multipay gam so I quite like this one
41:31 - you can see working here with our casual
41:33 - Co-op bus rooms and note how each one of
41:35 - them has a different console that is
41:37 - really awesome for debugging sample the
41:41 - next step for your team is usually to
41:42 - involve another play tester in a casual
41:45 - C scenario like we've seen in this slide
41:47 - before that will often be in a client
41:49 - authoritative multiplayer gameplay
41:51 - coupled to a BL server to accelerate
41:54 - your play testing phase we're
41:55 - integrating Unity gaming Services relay
41:58 - so you can simply create a session and
42:00 - get somebody else to join your play mode
42:02 - quickly your multiplayer game might
42:04 - require us that was really awesome I
42:06 - don't know if you noticed there was a
42:07 - little a little basically just drawing
42:09 - just putting the uh right there so
42:12 - basically there's a new thing to add the
42:13 - really join code so you don't have to do
42:15 - some complex coding you just right there
42:17 - start the CL automatically connects wow
42:18 - that is really awesome that really
42:20 - simplifies uh making the really work
42:22 - that's another great thing get somebody
42:24 - else to join your play mode quickly your
42:26 - multiplayer game might require a server
42:28 - authoritative model to prevent cheating
42:30 - for example when there is some
42:32 - competition
42:33 - involved while you could use multiplayer
42:35 - play mode with any net code stack here
42:38 - is an example based on dots for an
42:40 - action competition game showcased
42:42 - through a latest competitive sample Mega
42:43 - City metro in such a scenario
42:46 - multiplayer play mode will support the
42:48 - local and remote deployment of a
42:50 - dedicated server to keep your iteration
42:52 - loop as short as possible even when you
42:54 - have a complex Network topology oh
42:57 - interesting so basically you can uh test
42:59 - dedicated servers locally so basically
43:01 - it starts a dedicated server locally and
43:02 - creates the different oh that is good
43:04 - for testing so you always so you can
43:06 - basically always test on the uh server
43:08 - architecture that you choose instead of
43:10 - having to constantly test with just
43:12 - Local Host versus all using dedicated
43:14 - servers when deploying so yeah another
43:15 - great Improvement we've delivered
43:17 - dedicated server build Target allowing
43:20 - you to create both the client and the
43:22 - server from a single project reducing
43:24 - significantly the development and
43:25 - iteration time or adding additional
43:28 - content selection features that will
43:30 - help you get one step further in that
43:32 - process without custom scripts and help
43:34 - you make that server as lean as possible
43:37 - with options to strip out the client
43:38 - parts of your
43:39 - project another really awesome thing
43:41 - because yeah when I implemented uh
43:43 - multiplayer when I worked with that and
43:45 - also interesting how they're talking
43:46 - about multiplayer hosting I thought they
43:47 - officially changed the name of that one
43:49 - but anyways uh but yeah having to press
43:51 - a button instead of having to go once
43:53 - again instead of having to go onto the
43:54 - dashboard and upload a separate bill
43:55 - just being able to press a button and
43:57 - have all of that handled automatically
43:58 - in the background another great thing
44:00 - that mely improves inter interation yeah
44:03 - but when you need to introduce a cloud
44:04 - infrastructure in your iteration Loop
44:06 - for your dedicated server it can become
44:08 - difficult and slow to iterate this is
44:11 - why we have taken steps to automate the
44:13 - upload of your builds to your game
44:14 - server hosting solution in Unity gaming
44:17 - Services allowing to mix and match
44:20 - automatic creation of clients and server
44:22 - to run deployment scenarios faster and
44:24 - save you additional integration steps
44:26 - all all the multiplayer gameplay
44:28 - Solutions coming to you with unity
44:30 - engine are based on the transport
44:32 - package this package provides a robust
44:35 - low-level networking layer you can also
44:37 - leverage to build your own customized
44:39 - net code for specific game needs yeah by
44:42 - the way in case you don't know you if
44:43 - you don't want to use netco Frum objects
44:46 - you can just use the unity transport
44:47 - package if you don't want to deal with
44:49 - uh manually handling connections
44:50 - manually sending bites and so on if you
44:52 - want to build anything on top of that
44:54 - you can use just this one so one thing
44:56 - one project that I would like to try out
44:57 - is basically doing a non-game thing just
44:59 - using this one just sending bites
45:00 - between let's say a mobile device and a
45:02 - computer in order to control things so
45:04 - if you want to do simple things that
45:07 - remember how you don't need to use the
45:08 - entire the entire tool like you don't
45:09 - need to use net for game objects you can
45:11 - just use a transfer package which should
45:13 - help uh simplify basically just sending
45:15 - bytes back and forth so this is quite
45:17 - interesting transport now supports Unity
45:20 - B which means your solution could ship
45:22 - to all platforms of course multiplayer
45:25 - play mode and dedicated server work
45:27 - flows can be used with your custom
45:29 - Solutions as well building a multiplayer
45:31 - game today often requires to integrate
45:33 - several products and services together
45:35 - with thousands of lines of codes with
45:37 - our upcoming multiplayer Services SDK
45:40 - we're massively simplifying integration
45:42 - and dependency management while offering
45:44 - a new way to interact with their
45:46 - services oh that's another great one
45:49 - because yeah right now you basally need
45:50 - to uh individually interact with each
45:52 - one of these services so basally I've
45:54 - got tutorials on each one of these
45:56 - individually because each one
45:57 - individually he uses a different SDK so
45:59 - yeah having it all go through one single
46:01 - thing that once again that really
46:02 - simplifies things makes it easier to it
46:05 - rate upon implementing so yeah another
46:07 - great Improvement and dependency
46:10 - although interesting to see how vvox is
46:11 - apparently separate from that one I
46:12 - don't know why interesting management
46:15 - while offering a new way to interact
46:16 - with their services building reach
46:18 - multiplayer experiences can sometimes
46:21 - feel daunting due to the complexity and
46:23 - high operational costs involved but what
46:26 - if there was a way way to distribute the
46:27 - simulation worklow across clients in a
46:31 - way that's scalable and resilient
46:33 - reducing the burden on the server and
46:35 - opening up new possibilities for
46:37 - multiplayer
46:38 - development that's exactly what our new
46:41 - network topology solution called
46:43 - distributed Authority aims to achieve by
46:46 - leveraging The Familiar Unity net code
46:49 - solution net code for game objects that
46:52 - you already know and a new scalable
46:53 - Cloud backend that we provide
46:55 - distributed Authority enables you toload
46:58 - a significant portion of the
47:00 - computational workload from the server
47:02 - to the client and offers the flexibility
47:05 - to shift simulation between the two with
47:08 - such a solution you can build large
47:10 - scale multiplayer titles with lower
47:12 - operational costs engineering effort and
47:15 - improved scalability to accommodate a
47:17 - larger number of concurrent players
47:19 - opening up yeah this one is really
47:20 - interesting so basically you can have
47:22 - instead of having just a single host you
47:24 - can have multiple uh players each of
47:27 - them is responsible has authority over
47:29 - certain things over here the red one is
47:30 - responsible for these red balls the
47:31 - green one for this one so that's that's
47:34 - an interesting one for I guess it helps
47:36 - for the yeah like it says here
47:37 - distribute uh simulation workload so
47:39 - basally if you have lots of especially
47:41 - with lots of physics objects then yeah I
47:42 - guess this one would be interesting you
47:43 - have each Player handles just a handful
47:45 - of objects making the whole thing run
47:47 - much better as opposed to having all
47:49 - that stress on the on the H it's a an
47:51 - interesting one instead of having just
47:53 - one host then you got distributed
47:54 - Authority and of course dedicated
47:56 - service so three three interesting
47:57 - different modes up new possibilities for
48:00 - multiplayer development in the world of
48:02 - multiplayer games maintaining Fair
48:04 - competition is crucial to keep players
48:07 - engaged however you often face
48:09 - difficulties when it comes to
48:10 - establishing a skill system of your own
48:12 - our skill-based Matchmaker will
48:14 - eliminate the need for you to build a
48:16 - skill system from scratch through this
48:19 - feature you can effortlessly compute
48:21 - player skill scores using various
48:23 - metrics such as wins load out or
48:26 - achievements the skill-based Matchmaker
48:29 - can be easily configured to suit the
48:31 - specific requirements of each game
48:33 - ensuring a Level Playing Field for all
48:35 - players which Fosters a genuinely Fair
48:38 - competitive environment a boost player
48:40 - retention and engagement you also want
48:43 - to have better observability to track
48:45 - things that are happening to the matches
48:46 - created by the Matchmaker so that you
48:48 - can see Trends or catch issues earlier
48:50 - for debugging session details offers
48:53 - enhanced observability into the
48:55 - Matchmaker by provid you with match
48:57 - level details it can track major events
49:00 - that occur throughout the lifespan of
49:02 - each match such as the specific
49:04 - matchmaking rules that have been applied
49:05 - to a match the joining sequence of
49:07 - individual players and the fill up back
49:10 - fill up dates with match level
49:12 - observability you can identify Trends
49:14 - detect and resolve issues faster you to
49:16 - see time to iterate the matchmaking
49:18 - system just as we carefully curate
49:21 - matches to enhance player engagement our
49:23 - safet solution are tailored to safeguard
49:26 - our players making every game not just
49:28 - competitive but also a secure and
49:31 - welcoming space for everyone involved
49:33 - our approach centers on utilizing
49:35 - intelligent AI based detection systems
49:38 - for efficient monitoring of your voice
49:40 - and tax chat promoting positive behavior
49:42 - to cultivate respect and camaraderie and
49:45 - take actions to address identified toxic
49:47 - behaviors oh it's interesting how she
49:49 - mentioned both Voice and text chat I
49:52 - thought this one only worked with voice
49:53 - so yeah this could be interesting
49:54 - especially for IND game developers who
49:56 - can't really afford to have a massive
49:58 - moderation team yeah I think these tools
50:00 - can be quite interesting so basically
50:01 - making multiplayer games easier and then
50:03 - having this one in order to be able to
50:04 - more easily handle multiplayer games so
50:06 - yeah if you're a small team trying to
50:08 - handle that then hopefully this should
50:09 - be quite a useful tool safe always F A
50:13 - semantic and acoustic analysis for
50:14 - sharper insights limiting the need for
50:17 - human moderators to review the evidence
50:19 - this year we will roll out rule-based
50:21 - moderation actions which will increase
50:24 - the productivity and morale of
50:25 - moderation teams even more we're also
50:29 - excited that we will be launching our
50:30 - Innovative safe Tex platform featuring
50:33 - an Adaptive chat filter that actively
50:35 - screens and filters toxic content in
50:37 - real time complementing this our
50:40 - Advanced context analysis technology
50:42 - deals into the entirety of conversations
50:45 - enhancing the detection of toxic content
50:47 - by understanding the
50:49 - context with integrated evidence from
50:52 - safe voice and safe text you can quickly
50:54 - organize and prioritize incidents based
50:56 - on overall risk toxicity and disruption
50:59 - scores and really scale your moderation
51:01 - workflows you can not only take actions
51:04 - but also get an overview of moderation
51:05 - activity and player behavior in your
51:07 - game track sanctions and assess
51:09 - moderation efficiency using an intuitive
51:11 - dashboard together safe voice safe text
51:15 - and moderation fortifier our platform
51:17 - safety Suite allowing you to build
51:19 - communities that are safer by design
51:21 - game after game if you want to get a
51:23 - head start on multiplayer make sure you
51:26 - don't miss our Mega City metro sample
51:28 - talk and with that back to you Andrew of
51:31 - course yeah by the way there's a new
51:33 - Mega City sample I wonder if it's
51:35 - downloadable or if it's only visible HDC
51:37 - but yeah I think they they did announce
51:38 - it they did publish it so yeah basically
51:40 - there's a new Mega City metro so it uses
51:43 - uh it's a multiplayer game like one with
51:45 - chips flying around so if you've seen
51:47 - the last unite that one should be I
51:49 - believe it is downloadable right now I
51:51 - don't know I'll have to see afterwards
51:52 - but yeah that one should be using all
51:53 - these tools so it should be an
51:54 - interesting case study course
51:57 - building an immersive and engaging title
51:59 - is critical to the successful reception
52:00 - of your game but you're also concerned
52:03 - with making sure you're delivering your
52:05 - game where your players are and where
52:07 - they want to play unity's
52:09 - industry-leading platform support allows
52:11 - you to build for web mobile PC and XR
52:13 - including some of the hottest new
52:15 - devices let's welcome Tara to tell us
52:18 - more hey everyone my name is Tara and
52:21 - I'm on the product team here at Unity
52:23 - let's cover new features that will help
52:25 - you reach more players across Platforms
52:27 - in unity 6 we're willing out
52:28 - improvements to make your life easier
52:31 - when it comes to setting up your builds
52:32 - and exploring new platforms we've heard
52:35 - from many of you about the challenges of
52:37 - using custom scripts to manage builds
52:40 - because our settings are too rigid and
52:41 - only configurable at the project level
52:44 - we've taken your feedback to heart and
52:46 - are excited to announce the introduction
52:47 - of build profiles which give you the
52:50 - flexibility to create multiple profiles
52:52 - for a Target platform for each phase of
52:55 - your project whether whether it's a
52:56 - vertical slice a demo or the final
52:59 - version you can set custom settings and
53:01 - scene list for each profile and this one
53:04 - is a really awesome thing that I know
53:06 - people have won for a very long time so
53:07 - it's really awesome to see them finally
53:08 - going so basically instead of having you
53:10 - to make all kinds of custom scripts in
53:12 - order to make a build for Android then a
53:13 - build for seam then a build for the Epic
53:15 - gam store then another one for humble
53:17 - and so on instead of having to do all
53:18 - that you can just create profiles easily
53:20 - swap between them so yeah I think these
53:22 - These are it's something that people
53:24 - have won for a very long time so it's
53:25 - really awesome that it finally
53:26 - officially supported this one is really
53:28 - going to be quite helpful to a lot of
53:29 - people and that's not all we're also
53:32 - making it easier to discover the
53:34 - platforms that Unity supports through
53:36 - the new platform browser this isn't just
53:38 - a list it's your new shortcut to get
53:41 - everything set up with the Right
53:42 - Packages and the right settings for your
53:45 - Target platform
53:47 - automatically getting your games onto
53:49 - the web presents a huge opportunity for
53:51 - you to reach a larger audience of
53:53 - players starting with unity 6 you'll you
53:56 - be able to run your Unity games anywhere
53:58 - the web exists including mobile browsers
54:02 - you'll be able to run your Unity titles
54:04 - embedded in a web view inside a Native
54:06 - app or use our Progressive web app
54:08 - template to make your games behave like
54:10 - native apps along with their own
54:13 - shortcuts and through our strategic
54:15 - partnership with Google w GPU is now
54:18 - available in unity 6 beta with this
54:21 - early access to the web GPU backend you
54:24 - can now experiment with things like
54:26 - compute shaders GPU skitting VFX graph
54:29 - and more GPU driven rendering
54:32 - techniques the web GPU is really
54:34 - interesting but the last time that I
54:35 - researched I saw that it was in uh
54:37 - basically in the various browsers it is
54:39 - still in the experimental stage so this
54:41 - one seem it seems something really
54:42 - awesome but definitely something way out
54:44 - in the future I believe I don't know I'm
54:45 - not I'm not an expert in web but yeah it
54:48 - does seem something really awesome mean
54:49 - being able to use uh uh compute shaders
54:52 - to do all kinds of awesome stuff
54:53 - directly on a browser that definitely
54:54 - sounds excellent and mobile web is
54:56 - something that when they announced back
54:58 - back at unite there was huge cheers so
55:00 - I'm not too familiar with the with the
55:02 - uh web Market especially mobile web but
55:04 - apparently that's a huge deal so nice to
55:06 - see this yeah we've also partnered with
55:09 - meta to build support for their instant
55:11 - games platform through Facebook and
55:14 - messenger you'll have the opportunity to
55:16 - reach hundreds of millions of players
55:19 - that are discovering games every day
55:21 - with unity A6 you'll be able to easily
55:24 - build and publish web-based games to
55:26 - this platform and greatly expand your
55:29 - reach next let's review some exciting
55:32 - news from our partnership with Microsoft
55:35 - in unity 6 we're adding native Unity
55:37 - editor support for arm-based Windows
55:40 - devices this means you can work on your
55:42 - Unity games on even more windows devices
55:45 - taking advantage of the performance and
55:47 - flexibility that arm powered devices can
55:50 - offer you'll also be able to develop
55:52 - win32 games using Microsoft game
55:55 - development kit which contains the
55:57 - common tools to build Windows Standalone
56:00 - games we know how that's an interesting
56:03 - one how many how many devices nowadays
56:05 - have arm in them I don't think windows
56:08 - on arm is still very popular but hey
56:10 - anything that gets the editor available
56:12 - on more place is always a a great thing
56:14 - to see important it is that not only do
56:16 - your games install quickly but they're
56:18 - also performant across many different
56:20 - types of android devices to help with
56:23 - this Unity 6 supports play asset
56:25 - delivery
56:26 - through the new addressables Android
56:28 - package with this feature you'll benefit
56:31 - from Dynamic delivery options and when
56:33 - you combine this with texture
56:35 - compression Target formatting your
56:37 - players will get textures customized for
56:40 - their devices while still maintaining an
56:42 - overall smaller install size Unity will
56:46 - also include a new application point
56:48 - game activity powered by the Android
56:51 - game development kit this system brings
56:54 - a number of new benefits including
56:56 - improved threading and enhanced
56:58 - updatability through the use of Android
57:01 - X we've made some major improvements to
57:04 - iteration speeds while you're developing
57:06 - for console platforms unity's
57:09 - incremental build pipeline allows you to
57:11 - iterate more quickly in between builds
57:14 - once a scene has been built subsequent
57:16 - builds will focus only on the Delta
57:19 - meaning build times drastically reduced
57:21 - in most situations as you can see on
57:23 - screen when we tested the boat attack
57:25 - produ project after doing a script
57:27 - change build times dropped by almost 50%
57:31 - in unity 6 versus the 2021
57:34 - LTS after doing a script change build
57:37 - times dropped almost 50% in unity 6
57:40 - versus the 2021 LTS and building is
57:44 - seene without any changes dropped from
57:46 - 40 seconds to just over
57:49 - five yeah this one is something that
57:51 - they've had for quite a while I'm pretty
57:53 - sure this was available in the 22 LTS
57:55 - and this one is definitely really
57:56 - awesome really massive massive
57:57 - improvements back when I was making my
57:59 - my uh multiplayer free course the
58:01 - kitchen chaos course back when I was
58:03 - making that one since I had to
58:04 - constantly make builds this one really
58:05 - helped without this one it would take
58:07 - like minutes to make a build but with
58:09 - this one took a few seconds and yeah
58:10 - when when making builds for consoles
58:12 - this is one of the things that you
58:13 - definitely want to be super nice and
58:15 - snappy that's a huge Improvement that
58:17 - will offer significant benefits to your
58:20 - iteration speeds during
58:22 - development lastly let's dive into new
58:25 - capabilities for XR platforms while we
58:28 - have a ton of new features coming in
58:29 - unity 6 for XR development let's
58:32 - highlight a few of these key features
58:34 - you can use while developing for
58:35 - platforms like meta Quest and vision
58:38 - OS whether you want to expand your
58:40 - existing game with mixed reality or
58:43 - you're making something entirely new AA
58:45 - Foundation empowers you to incorporate
58:47 - the physical world into the player's
58:49 - experience in a cross-platform way and
58:53 - in unity 6 we're expanding meshing
58:56 - occlusion bounding boxes and persistent
58:58 - anchors to additional platforms like
59:01 - meta Quest Vision OS and Android we're
59:04 - also adding Vulcan support in AR core
59:07 - and enhancing it for meta Quest so your
59:09 - players have smoother more performant
59:12 - visuals one feature we're super excited
59:15 - about is composition layers another way
59:17 - to improve the visual Fidelity of your
59:19 - game here we have a side by-side
59:22 - comparison on one side a regular texture
59:25 - and on the other a composition layer as
59:27 - you can see the use of composition
59:29 - layers significantly reduces artifacts
59:32 - giving us clearer text sharper outlines
59:35 - and overall a better appearance we've
59:38 - also created interactive UI components
59:41 - for composition layers allowing you to
59:43 - get started with minimal setup or easily
59:46 - convert your existing
59:48 - UI we know that sitting up multiplayer
59:50 - for your VR games is difficult so we're
59:53 - trying to make this easier through our
59:55 - new multiplayer VR template built on top
59:58 - of open XR this template is a first
60:01 - class Showcase of unity's breadth of
60:04 - multiplayer Services allowing you to get
60:06 - straight to building content with
60:08 - spatialized voice chat lobbies networked
60:11 - interactions and hand
60:13 - tracking finally a feature I know many
60:16 - of you are excited about for those
60:18 - developing for vision OS plated device
60:21 - is a gamechanging feature that leverages
60:23 - unity's poly spatial technology to
60:26 - stream your apps content over the local
60:28 - network enabling you to iterate and
60:30 - preview your content across the unity
60:33 - editor the vision OS simulator or apple
60:36 - Vision Pro wow that is really awesome
60:39 - just looking at that little SC makes me
60:41 - think how this would be quite a a fun
60:43 - tool for doing some kind of level design
60:45 - like being able to physically move the
60:47 - the level parts around that could be a
60:50 - really fun use case yeah the vision W
60:52 - quite nice any tweaks that you make in
60:55 - the unity editor
60:56 - like adding game objects adjusting
60:58 - inspector values or refining Shader
61:00 - graphs instantly sync to your simulator
61:03 - or device in real time and what's even
61:06 - cooler if you use this new feature while
61:09 - wearing a visual Pro you can work in the
61:11 - editor using Mac virtual display and see
61:14 - your spatial content right next to it
61:17 - this is an incredible new way to work
61:19 - while developing your games for vision
61:22 - OS thank you all for listening to our
61:25 - exciting updates on Unity
61:27 - platforms so with all yeah that all
61:29 - sounds really interesting honestly when
61:32 - I first started about the uh Vision Pro
61:34 - I didn't really have much interest in
61:35 - especially given how how expensive it is
61:38 - but the more I see it the more the more
61:39 - I get interested in wanting to try it
61:41 - out make some uh fun interesting
61:43 - prototypes with it but yeah it's still
61:45 - really expensive so yeah still not quite
61:47 - sure and actually over here in Portugal
61:49 - I still can't even buy it even if I even
61:51 - if I wanted to pay for it so yeah it's
61:53 - uh but yeah definitely one day I
61:54 - definitely would like to can apply for
61:56 - Dev kid oh that would be nice if I if I
61:58 - could because yeah that would be
62:00 - definitely got especially seeing this oh
62:02 - that looks quite interesting for making
62:04 - all kinds of L designs so yeah it's nice
62:06 - how how as the device matures hopefully
62:09 - the use case become a bit more more
62:11 - evident becomes a bit easier to figure
62:13 - out what the device can do all the
62:15 - possibilities in front of you and the
62:17 - rich diversity of ideas you want to
62:18 - bring to life it is important Unity
62:20 - gives you the room you need to explore
62:22 - and grow your Ambitions along with your
62:24 - game success
62:26 - we're already hard at work modernizing
62:28 - the foundations of the engine and want
62:30 - to unveil more details about our
62:32 - progress there please welcome luron to
62:34 - walk you through some of the key aspects
62:36 - of our
62:37 - plan hi I'm Nan keot product manager at
62:41 - Unity before we look at some of our
62:42 - targets for the future it would be
62:44 - useful to quickly revisit the new
62:46 - foundational capabilities that landed in
62:48 - a Unity engine over the last 12 months
62:51 - I'm talking in particular about ECS
62:53 - ntity component system a core frame work
62:56 - about data oriented technology stack
62:59 - dots starting with unity 2022 RTS ECS is
63:02 - fully integrated into the editor and
63:04 - supported for production on all
63:06 - platforms NS architecture helps design
63:09 - more flexible game code architecture
63:11 - this allows games like evish to Pivot
63:13 - their game IDs more easily during
63:15 - production reducing refactoring
63:17 - risk ECS also gives you complete control
63:20 - of your target device Hardware this is
63:22 - how title like detonation racing could
63:24 - deliver such an and game PL on the
63:26 - target device ECS efficient memory
63:29 - layout and scalable processing enable
63:31 - the simulation of many more enemies with
63:33 - complex physical gameplay like in ostar
63:35 - and Mars the many hundreds of thousands
63:38 - of dynamic objects of the V Rising open
63:39 - world are being brought to life based on
63:42 - the ECS for Unity stack and finally ECS
63:45 - for Unity Powers a new range of
63:47 - multiplayer gameplay possibilities
63:49 - thanks to its net cut stack and
63:51 - determinism if you want to see a fully
63:53 - functional demonstration of this please
63:55 - check out Mega C Metro scalable High
63:57 - concurrency crossplatform sample of our
64:00 - endtoend multiplayer platforms that we
64:02 - play tested with more than a 100 players
64:05 - we are committed to the do EOS system as
64:08 - demonstrated yeah right away I really
64:10 - like that line because yeah anytime I
64:11 - mention dots there's always one one
64:13 - comment who goes well dots is nice but
64:16 - is going to abandon it a while so yeah
64:18 - I'm really happy to see that every time
64:19 - they mention some kind of thing they
64:20 - mention how they're committed for the
64:22 - for the long term so you are safe to use
64:24 - it and yep they've already put out quite
64:26 - a lot of impressive updates 1.1 1.2 1.3
64:29 - so yeah they're constantly this
64:31 - definitely not something that they've
64:32 - been building on and they're not and
64:34 - they're now going to drop nope this is
64:35 - definitely something that they are
64:36 - committed to going for the uh long-term
64:39 - future so yeah I personally as someone
64:41 - who's a a really big fan of dots and I
64:43 - really want to see the future where
64:45 - pretty much the engine behind it uses
64:47 - dots mean that if you yourself still
64:49 - just use game objects you still get the
64:51 - benefits from all this dot stuff because
64:53 - the background is all using dots so it's
64:54 - all super performance so yeah personally
64:57 - when it comes to dots I think it's
64:58 - already awesome right now and I'm really
64:59 - excited to see everything that's going
65:00 - to come in the future by the Min minor
65:03 - versions of ECS for Unity currently
65:05 - being worked out ECS 1.1 and 1.2 are
65:09 - already available in the package manager
65:11 - and we're preparing version
65:12 - 1.3 we've been listening to your
65:14 - immediate feedback from your production
65:16 - environments and prepared many different
65:18 - fixes and improvements that will be
65:20 - delivered back where you work on Unity
65:22 - 2022 RTS and unity 6 at lunch
65:26 - in a recent survey 25% of you told us
65:29 - you could use ECS as a solution in
65:31 - production however you also told us that
65:34 - ECS can represent a significant learning
65:36 - curve resulting in a little less than
65:38 - 10% being able to actually Implement a
65:40 - production this is short of our goal
65:43 - which is to deliver data oriented
65:45 - performance to every single one of your
65:48 - projects this is why we've been at work
65:50 - bringing game objects and entities
65:52 - closer together in a future version of
65:54 - unity after after
65:56 - unit6 by doing so we will make ECS power
65:59 - available to you in the context of the
66:01 - editor to Lage its runtime power for
66:03 - authoring
66:04 - workflows this would also make it easier
66:06 - for you to introduce a targeted ECS
66:08 - solution to your game object based
66:10 - projects to tackle a specific
66:12 - performance
66:13 - bottleneck and finally this will help us
66:16 - deliver more performance to all of you
66:18 - in many cases without having to expose
66:20 - the ECS complexity if you don't need it
66:23 - so yeah basically that's what I was
66:24 - saying that's there that's their goal
66:26 - I've spoken to a few times and he has
66:27 - mentioned how that is the goal how
66:29 - basically the unity backend they're
66:31 - going to uh be using more and more dots
66:33 - on that so even if you yourself don't
66:35 - use any dots at all if you don't touch
66:37 - ECS directly you are still going to
66:38 - benefit from all those all those
66:40 - benefits yeah it was interesting because
66:42 - yeah like the number said 100% of people
66:44 - do want performance improvements
66:46 - everyone always wants more performance
66:48 - so if the engine by itself just without
66:49 - you having to do anything specifically
66:51 - if just by itself the engine already
66:53 - performs better that is uh really
66:54 - awesome regardless of what you're trying
66:56 - to use so yeah like I said really
66:58 - excited for the future of dots the first
67:00 - Milestone of this convergence is to
67:02 - ensure that for every game object of
67:04 - your project there is an equivalent
67:06 - entity link to it this simplifies
67:08 - manipulating your project data through
67:10 - both environments the most important
67:12 - data you usually need to synchronize
67:14 - between game object and ECS or object
67:16 - Transformations this is why we are
67:18 - aligning both transformation apis and
67:20 - data structure to boost synchronization
67:23 - performance this will lead us to unify
67:26 - the scene and build workflows to ensure
67:28 - that regardless of the system you use
67:29 - for manipulating your project data we
67:32 - provide a fully unified experience as I
67:34 - mentioned a little bit earlier wow that
67:37 - was quite a lot of information okay
67:39 - interesting so basically this this is
67:41 - all for the future so this is all Beyond
67:43 - Unity s so definitely not something that
67:44 - is going to happen this year interesting
67:46 - game objects are also entity so are they
67:48 - going to make so that by default every
67:49 - single game object you create has an
67:51 - entty attached to it and this really
67:53 - screenshot over here seems really
67:54 - interesting so basically you've got the
67:55 - built-in components so the regular
67:57 - transform rigid body then you've got
67:59 - some custom Behavior components so
68:00 - regular uh mono behaviors and then
68:02 - apparently on that one you can also add
68:04 - some component data so that is really
68:05 - interesting so being able to have
68:07 - basically put all together and somehow
68:09 - magically it all works both ECS and game
68:12 - wow that's uh I imagine this is a very
68:15 - significant engineering challenge but
68:16 - yeah I I I quite like the ambition it
68:20 - does sound it does sound like the future
68:22 - is going to be very difficult for Unity
68:24 - but very interesting potentially very
68:26 - powerful that regardless of the system
68:28 - you use for manipulating your project
68:30 - data we provide a fully unified
68:32 - experience as I mentioned a little bit
68:34 - earlier converging game object and ECS
68:37 - will have amazing applications with
68:39 - scalable project authoring workflows to
68:42 - illustrate this we've been working on a
68:43 - major rework of our engine animation
68:45 - system that will be based on ECS the
68:48 - additional performance row allows us to
68:50 - deliver more complex and dynamic
68:52 - workflows to you in the editor as well
68:55 - as giving giv you the ability to have
68:56 - many more characters on screen at an
68:58 - unprecedented level of complexity at one
69:00 - time yeah again so this the kind of
69:02 - thing if they themselves improve the
69:04 - animation on the back end to be able to
69:05 - use dots you yourself can keep using the
69:07 - regular animation tools and basically
69:09 - everything will just run faster so yeah
69:10 - this is exactly what I want to see we've
69:13 - also been out our work to reimagine our
69:15 - world building workflows based on thiss
69:17 - again this work will bring us closer to
69:20 - large open world support out of the box
69:22 - in unity we'll share more about those
69:24 - developments in the future
69:26 - yes when it comes to wor building also
69:28 - interesting because the uh Unity terrain
69:30 - is something that I have not used
69:32 - personally way too much I usually don't
69:33 - use uh complex rins in my games but I've
69:35 - heard a lot of people have a lot of
69:37 - gripes with it so yeah being able to
69:39 - have that be a lot more efficient a lot
69:41 - more performant and a lot more capable
69:43 - with a lot more features that sounds
69:45 - great speaking of delivering additional
69:47 - performance to 100% of unity project I'm
69:50 - glad to inform you that we're making
69:52 - significant progress with our migration
69:54 - to co C all this is another step in
69:56 - modernizing the cor foundations of the
69:58 - unity
69:59 - engine the World of. Net is changing
70:02 - rapidly and performance enhancements are
70:04 - coming with every new version of friends
70:06 - up Microsoft release with our work on
70:08 - integrating cor out to Unity we'll bring
70:11 - additional RW speed to the editor
70:13 - simpler ID build integration and faster
70:16 - code reload this will result in major
70:18 - improvements to iteration time on the
70:21 - other hand new optimization in garbage
70:23 - collection will dramatically improve the
70:25 - Run Time Performance the other signs are
70:27 - pretty good some parts of the unity
70:29 - editors and tests we made with ui2 kit
70:32 - are running twice as fast we are excited
70:35 - to deliver okay so yeah that is
70:37 - definitely again keep in mind this is
70:39 - all for Beyond un6 so definitely not
70:41 - going to happen this year this something
70:43 - uh for next year and Beyond but yeah all
70:45 - these sound really good improvements I
70:46 - still haven't researched the cor ER too
70:48 - much so I'm not I'm not too sure on the
70:50 - specifics but from what I know it's just
70:52 - objectively a great Improvement so I
70:53 - mean iteration time uh that's one thing
70:56 - that a lot of people are constantly Ming
70:57 - about how it takes way too long to just
70:59 - change one thing and recompile it takes
71:01 - way too long so anything that improves
71:02 - that that's really awesome and of course
71:04 - yeah better runtime performance and
71:05 - feature proofing this actually this
71:07 - actually something that un has done
71:08 - quite well uh recently whereas
71:10 - previously uh Unity used to be in like I
71:12 - don't know four or five uh C versions
71:14 - behind whereas lately it's been uh
71:16 - pretty good and I imagine once they move
71:18 - on to the Corr staying up to date with
71:21 - all the C version that should be even
71:23 - faster so yeah and garbage collection
71:25 - will dramatically improve the runtime
71:27 - performance the other signs are pretty
71:29 - good some parts of the unity editors and
71:31 - tests we made with youu to Kit are
71:33 - running twice as fast we are excited to
71:37 - deliver all of those performance
71:38 - improvements in future releases of unity
71:41 - so that you're able to build on more
71:42 - ambitious games regardless of your
71:44 - expertise well there you have it the
71:47 - bulk of what you saw over this past hour
71:49 - is coming to you soon in unity 6 Unity 6
71:52 - preview is will be released in May with
71:54 - full production support until Unity 6 is
71:56 - released later this year we looked at
71:59 - new tools and new services that coupled
72:01 - with the improvements and upgrades
72:02 - you've made to the engine overall go
72:05 - really some way to addressing the most
72:07 - common requests and scenarios you tell
72:09 - us you faced frequently we're pretty
72:11 - proud of what we're delivering in the
72:12 - next major release of unity and we can't
72:14 - wait to see what you can cve with it
72:17 - thank you for joining
72:19 - us all right so yeah personally I think
72:22 - that was that was really great a lot of
72:24 - things com in the future and even more
72:26 - Beyond so yeah in general yeah I'm quite
72:30 - a big fan of of the road map started off
72:33 - quite interesting lots of uh rendering
72:34 - improvements so yeah that one is always
72:36 - something that is like I said I'm not a
72:38 - graphics programmer so anything in which
72:40 - I can just take a box and everything
72:41 - runs faster oh and by the way you can go
72:43 - ahead and download the urp samples to
72:45 - the uh happy harvest so yeah the uh the
72:49 - things that make the code run much
72:50 - faster yeah this one definitely looking
72:52 - forward to that just take a box and
72:54 - everything runs faster so
72:55 - that one is really good then all the
72:57 - improvements about rendering and all
72:58 - kinds of stuff so if you if you are more
73:00 - of an artist if you do all kinds of
73:02 - things then these improvements are
73:03 - definitely going to be very useful and
73:05 - the one about water it just sucks how
73:08 - this one is apparently still just agrp
73:09 - only but still if you are using a grp
73:12 - then this water system does look really
73:14 - awesome really excellent and so many
73:15 - things about speed tree Muse AI also
73:18 - seems to continue to improve so that's
73:20 - great to see as long as that one
73:21 - continues it's going to be great and
73:23 - Muse animate this one is the one that
73:25 - personally I'm most interested in being
73:26 - able to quickly generate some prototype
73:28 - animations in order to make some
73:29 - prototype work much better so this
73:31 - sounds really good same thing for sound
73:33 - effects if this one works I I I'm very
73:35 - curious to try this out and see how good
73:37 - it is because I don't know I imagine
73:39 - that making sound effects actually more
73:41 - complex than making Sprites maybe I'm
73:43 - wrong about that I don't know but uh
73:44 - yeah I'm curious to see how many
73:46 - different sounds this can make but yeah
73:48 - basically when it comes to uh Muse and
73:50 - all their AI tools I think these are
73:52 - really excellent for quickly building
73:54 - all kinds of prototypes so you've got
73:55 - some kind of idea and very quickly you
73:57 - can generate assets animations sound
73:59 - effects uh Behavior trees make the level
74:01 - make everything so yeah for the
74:03 - prototyping stage I think these tools
74:04 - are extremely helpful and yeah all the
74:07 - uh day-to-day improvements these are all
74:08 - really excellent like really tiny things
74:10 - that massively improve uh your speed of
74:13 - iteration of working with the editor so
74:15 - these were really good and yeah more and
74:18 - more things about asset management and
74:19 - all kinds of things more improvements
74:21 - with shad graph and the multiplayer
74:23 - Center this one is definitely some that
74:25 - I'm very much looking forward to so this
74:27 - one says coming in un6 so this one is
74:29 - coming so basically you've got a window
74:31 - where you can select some kind of
74:32 - template and basically automatically
74:34 - automatically pre-selects all the things
74:36 - to install and automatically installs
74:38 - all the packages so this one should once
74:39 - again should really help simplify the
74:41 - process for starting off a brand new
74:43 - multiplayer game Prototype so that one's
74:44 - really awesome multiplayer play mode so
74:46 - you don't have to constantly make brand
74:48 - new builds every time so that really
74:50 - speeds up the relay being much easier to
74:52 - integrate that one is also another
74:54 - really awesome thing same thing for
74:55 - dedicated server just pressing a button
74:57 - instead of having to go into an external
74:58 - thing to make a separate build and
75:00 - upload so that's really good the
75:03 - multiplayer SDK basically uh unifying
75:05 - all the different multiplayer tools into
75:07 - one thing that you can very easily
75:08 - access that's another great thing for
75:10 - EAS of views distributed Authority so
75:13 - this is one is also going to be really
75:14 - interesting for making different kinds
75:16 - of games that can handle much better
75:18 - safe voice again if you're if you've got
75:20 - some kind of multiplayer game being able
75:21 - to safely handle that Community
75:23 - especially if you are a small in
75:25 - developer who who can't really afford an
75:28 - entire dedicated team for moderation
75:30 - these tools can be extremely useful and
75:33 - yeah build profiles this one is really
75:34 - awesome this one is something that a lot
75:35 - of people have won for a very long time
75:37 - so it's really awesome to see that
75:38 - coming in mobile web support again this
75:41 - one is apparently a super huge deal so
75:42 - it's really nice to see and web GPU as
75:44 - well being able to use compute shaders
75:46 - directly on the browser that seems like
75:48 - a really awesome upgrade and yeah even
75:51 - more performance improvements just
75:52 - improving all kinds of things all the AR
75:55 - stuff I have to say I still haven't I've
75:57 - wanted to to play around with ar and VR
75:59 - for a very long time but I still haven't
76:01 - gotten around to it so yeah all of these
76:03 - things sound really interesting but I
76:05 - don't have much experience I definitely
76:08 - definitely would like to try it out at
76:09 - some point because all of these
76:10 - improvements with the uh occlusion that
76:13 - one as far as I know used to be a really
76:14 - complex problem but over here on this
76:16 - demo it seems like it was working quite
76:17 - well I mean those those balls are being
76:20 - stuck behind that wall and so on
76:21 - improving visual visual Fidelity with
76:24 - TCH specifically this one one is also
76:25 - really awesome every time I played a VR
76:27 - game every time you have to read some
76:28 - kind of tutorial it's always really
76:30 - messed up so these improvements seem
76:32 - really good search experience this one
76:34 - again something to very quickly speed up
76:36 - and this one this one uh seemed really
76:38 - awesome to me I mean being able to do
76:40 - level design by physically handling
76:42 - things inside your Apple Vision Pro
76:44 - visually moving things around in order
76:46 - to create your own level this makes it
76:48 - really awesome honestly it makes me like
76:50 - I played uh I spent most of my childhood
76:52 - playing Counter-Strike so right away
76:53 - looking at this one SP espcially like
76:55 - this where it looks some kind of desert
76:56 - it makes me imagine oh it would be
76:58 - really awesome to have like uh the map
77:00 - this to right here next to me so I can
77:02 - play around with moving all the crates I
77:04 - think that would be really awesome so
77:05 - yeah lots of improvements there and
77:08 - everything with dots is already awesome
77:10 - and continues being really awesome and
77:11 - for the future so many things coming in
77:14 - bring game objects and entities closer
77:16 - together that one sounds really really
77:18 - ambitious really exciting so I'm
77:19 - definitely very curious to see how that
77:20 - one is going to go dots animation really
77:22 - awesome World building as well so yeah
77:25 - when it comes to the Future and Corr
77:26 - just making everything snappier and
77:27 - faster than it seems really good so yeah
77:30 - I mean all in all I have to say I'm
77:32 - quite quite pleased with this with this
77:33 - little uh road map so yeah I'm curious
77:36 - to see what are you all thinking because
77:38 - yeah I have to say I was I was focusing
77:40 - way too much on on watching so I didn't
77:42 - really read too many comments so I'm
77:44 - curious to see what is the sentiment
77:46 - what do all of you all of you feel and
77:49 - yeah it seems like the unity 6 beta is
77:51 - out now I thought the preview was out
77:53 - but no that that's the thing that's a
77:55 - little bit confusing so previously you
77:57 - used to have the beta then the text
78:00 - stack and then the LTS whereas now
78:02 - you've got beta then preview and then
78:04 - the final version so right now
78:05 - apparently un6 the beta is out right now
78:08 - well actually I can just open it up and
78:10 - try to see apparently if I go into
78:13 - installs install the
78:15 - editor okay so okay so it's on prly so
78:18 - basically it's the unity 6 which is
78:20 - 6,000 which is kind of fun yeah so
78:22 - apparently that one is in beta then
78:24 - apparently in sometime uh around March
78:27 - no may I think that's what they said so
78:29 - around May it's going to go into preview
78:31 - which is basically going to be the
78:32 - equivalent of previously what used to be
78:34 - the uh uh beta version Oh God this so so
78:38 - confusing but after figure out I guess
78:40 - it's going to be but basically yeah so
78:42 - the preview and then comes the unit6
78:44 - proper which is going to be the
78:45 - equivalent of an LTS version so yeah so
78:48 - yeah that one is uh quite interesting
78:50 - okay let me read some
78:52 - comments does this mean we won't have C
78:54 - 12 I'm actually not sure I'm not sure
78:56 - what what specific version of C is
78:59 - currently going on so about Vision Pro
79:03 - is just imagine how this Tech Will
79:04 - evolve in the coming years yep I I
79:06 - definitely I agree I mean uh
79:09 - the The Vision Pro and this little push
79:12 - for AR since uh since uh Apple is now
79:16 - coming in they're really putting in a
79:18 - ton of money into it I think that is
79:19 - going to be I think that is definitely
79:21 - just the beginning so I'm very curious
79:23 - to see how that one going to go thing
79:26 - change the approach of the multiplayer
79:27 - tutorial are you talking about the
79:28 - distributed networking no that is
79:30 - basically just a different one so you
79:32 - can now just host just one one person
79:34 - host or it can have dedicated server or
79:35 - it can have distributed Authority which
79:37 - basically each player holds uh authority
79:40 - over different parts of the map so
79:41 - basically it allows you to make bigger
79:43 - more complex games and I think that also
79:46 - means that players don't have to be on
79:47 - the same place at all time I don't know
79:49 - I'll have to try that out so basally you
79:50 - could have different games with all
79:52 - kinds of things so yeah this6 coming out
79:55 - we check to see if it was worth updating
79:57 - d g suit yeah maybe I mean that would be
79:59 - definitely an interesting thing
80:00 - depending on the improvements especially
80:02 - especially if I can just take a box and
80:04 - the game runs 50% faster in terms of
80:06 - rendering yeah I guess that that would
80:08 - be awesome so we shall see uh what
80:11 - happens in the in the future yeah still
80:13 - scared to touch ECS and fill coding
80:15 - things but yeah that's what L was saying
80:17 - which is basically the goal is to get to
80:19 - the point where you yourself don't have
80:21 - to specifically touch ECS if you're just
80:23 - using Unity unity in the background is
80:24 - going to be using ECS and dots in order
80:26 - to make everything much faster so even
80:28 - if you yourself just use play on game
80:30 - objects everything should still
80:31 - hopefully be quite a bit faster so yeah
80:34 - hopefully that should be even if you are
80:36 - concerned about ECS you should still
80:37 - benefit from quite a lot of these things
80:40 - what about the runtime fee I made a
80:42 - video on the updated things so basically
80:45 - uh in most cases just don't worry about
80:47 - it because not if you are an inev like
80:50 - me Dania you're not going to and uh I
80:52 - don't remember the big takeaway but yeah
80:54 - I'm made I made a video on that so if
80:56 - you want to see uh a crap um
81:00 - yeah uh but yeah so essentially that
81:03 - thing technically the fee still exists
81:04 - on Unity 6 so only on that version
81:07 - afterwards but yeah it's all based on
81:09 - you tell Unity how many copies you sold
81:11 - and it's based on that it's not based on
81:12 - inss or anything like that so basically
81:14 - the math is the fee ends up being if you
81:17 - have to pay it's at most 2.5% so
81:19 - personally I don't think that's going to
81:21 - be an issue at least personally for me
81:23 - as a solo IND game developer I've never
81:24 - going to hit the limits of selling over
81:26 - $1 million and 1 million copies I'm
81:29 - never going to hit those numbers so
81:30 - personally that is something that I
81:31 - don't really worry about so if you are
81:33 - an in like me then yep also yeah exactly
81:36 - if anything you can just do 2.5% Revenue
81:38 - so yeah if you are concerned about the
81:40 - runtime fee you can just do the math
81:42 - with that and it's always guaranteed
81:43 - going to be less than that so yeah and
81:46 - yeah the splash SC yeah another thing
81:47 - that they actually didn't mentioned they
81:49 - they should have mentioned because it's
81:50 - something that a lot of people have been
81:51 - looking for basically starting with un6
81:54 - if you're using the completely free
81:55 - version you no longer have to use Unity
81:57 - splash screen so I know a lot of people
81:59 - really dislike that so yeah starting on
82:02 - Unity 6 yep you can just remove the
82:04 - splash screen if you want and should be
82:06 - like that and yeah they also put out
82:08 - this road map let's see if this has a
82:10 - little bit more information oh it
82:12 - actually has the uh Unity 2024 oh crap I
82:17 - moved uh the report which is actually
82:20 - quite uh let me get the yeah if you want
82:24 - to download the the
82:27 - report there it is cuz this one is
82:30 - actually it's
82:32 - a DNT gaming report yeah I'm planning to
82:35 - make a video on this basically this has
82:37 - a m oh crap because right now I've got
82:39 - to access basically it has a a ton of
82:41 - information all kinds of things so yeah
82:43 - definitely check out that link and
82:44 - definitely check out that report because
82:46 - it has a ton of stuff it's really a
82:48 - giant page with tons of information and
82:50 - yeah it has all kinds of things from
82:52 - single player games multiplayer games
82:53 - games made with Studios with the with
82:56 - the small teams uh what are the current
82:58 - challenges what are the best ways to
83:00 - solve those challenges and so on so I
83:01 - definitely encourage you to go and check
83:03 - out the uh gaming report like I said
83:05 - I'll be making a video on that covering
83:06 - the core things uh and yeah the road
83:09 - ahead for
83:10 - un6 and that is indeed uh this video
83:13 - really nice it was actually relatively
83:15 - short but nice and compact really nice
83:17 - and solid 45 minutes of just excellent
83:19 - information that was good that was nice
83:21 - oh yeah and the mega City metro sample
83:23 - apparently you can download this right
83:25 - now so yep you can download the mega
83:27 - City metro so this is an end to end
83:29 - multiplayer demo I believe it is using
83:31 - yep it is using net for entities because
83:33 - it supports 128 players crossplatform so
83:36 - it's all really awesome and it's uh it's
83:38 - even uh
83:41 - playable okay so this is the old one
83:43 - yeah so basally
83:46 - yeah yeah basically there was the Mega
83:48 - City demo which is kind of funny how it
83:50 - was the very first demo that they
83:51 - showcased when they first talked about
83:53 - dots in I don't know like 2016 2017 so
83:56 - so many years ago they first announced
83:58 - uh the original Mega City demo so it's
84:01 - really awesome how right now what is it
84:03 - like five six seven years later now
84:05 - finally this demo is now downloadable
84:07 - works perfectly single player
84:08 - multiplayer so yeah definitely if you
84:10 - want to see how it all works definitely
84:12 - download the sample and give it a try
84:14 - because yeah it is something that seems
84:15 - very impressive basically it's got large
84:17 - scale streaming and rendering with ECS
84:19 - that's awesome interpolation prediction
84:21 - like compensation that is something that
84:22 - a lot of people have asked how do you do
84:24 - that well you can just look at this proc
84:26 - at this project max out performance with
84:28 - 128 players on mobile that is really
84:30 - awesome and on desktop enabled by dots
84:32 - and urp that's awesome and it's using
84:34 - all these all these servers so it uses
84:36 - uh dedicated servers it's got Matchmaker
84:39 - and vvox so you can chat around so yeah
84:41 - this demo seems definitely really
84:43 - complex I definitely would like to try
84:45 - it out for a little bit to spend some
84:46 - time inspecting it because that's
84:48 - definitely seems quite impressive so yep
84:51 - if you want you can go ahead and
84:52 - download it streamline work for Unity
84:55 - cloud like I said since I'm a a solo
84:57 - game developer usually these kinds of
84:59 - tools aren't really all that useful to
85:00 - me but if you work as a team from from
85:03 - what I can see these tools do seem uh
85:05 - extremely useful for working with teams
85:06 - and collaborating or even if you just do
85:09 - uh a couple of game gems every now and
85:10 - then these do seem quite useful for
85:14 - that and Muse preview for texture 3D
85:18 - yeah like I was saying when we were
85:19 - watching the road map I'm not I'm not a
85:22 - a 3D modeler myself so I don't
85:24 - specifically know exactly what what this
85:26 - one is meant to what is the challenge
85:29 - that this one is solving I'm not 100%
85:31 - sure
85:33 - how basically you give it a 3D model and
85:35 - generates a texture that adapts
85:36 - perfectly to that model I'm not entirely
85:38 - sure but it does seem extremely
85:40 - impressive so yep it's really nice how
85:43 - Unity Muse is iterating upon itself and
85:45 - becoming better and better that's
85:46 - another thing that I'm very curious to
85:48 - see how it's going to go along in the
85:51 - future tap Joy daily rewards in Google
85:53 - ad for mobile okay so I'm not into the
85:56 - mobile market so I have no idea what
85:58 - this means but if you are hopefully this
85:59 - is something nice and celebrating the UN
86:01 - Community again it's always really
86:03 - awesome to see all of these really
86:05 - awesome games and again how they're all
86:06 - really so different so there's one top
86:09 - down action game then you've got
86:11 - something really stylized really awesome
86:13 - another thing really stylized really
86:15 - awesome oh and this one that looks
86:16 - really awesome no rest for the Wicket
86:18 - just in case you don't know this
86:19 - actually apparently it's the new game by
86:22 - the developers that made or and it's
86:24 - kind of like an action game very strange
86:27 - so it's kind of funny how they went from
86:29 - uh ay which was a really Jolly really
86:32 - nice real nice looking game to making
86:34 - something really dark and yeah this one
86:36 - looks really awesome some kind of thing
86:37 - with zombies something else with some
86:38 - really gorgeous 2D art and Lego builders
86:41 - and yeah they show in AR that is also
86:43 - really awesome and yeah South Field I'm
86:45 - not familiar with this one but nice
86:47 - building multiplayer and another one
86:49 - with a really interesting art cell that
86:51 - is really interesting arcade Paradise so
86:53 - yeah as you can see tons and tons of oh
86:55 - look at that all of those games are
86:56 - inside an arcade that was fun hey funer
86:58 - Chronicles yeah I really enjoyed playing
87:00 - the original funer so that one looks
87:02 - really good and something with tons and
87:04 - tons of characters and something with
87:06 - some really awesome mechs wow that looks
87:08 - really cool o
87:10 - nice oh that looks nice and this one for
87:13 - some reason apparently you play a
87:15 - character who has an angry foot I'm
87:16 - pretty sure I saw some gifts of this
87:18 - like one year ago two years ago on
87:19 - Twitter something like that but yeah
87:22 - basically looking at these szz reals
87:23 - it's always really awesome to see the
87:25 - variety and the the awesomeness of all
87:27 - these games shown here so it's always
87:30 - really awesome yeah yeah Thomas B FAL
87:33 - near cron account yeah that one I
87:34 - definitely want to give that a shot
87:35 - because that seems quite interesting so
87:37 - yeah so many things all really
87:39 - impressive yeah thank for the
87:41 - conversation and memories as we close
87:42 - out GDC want to thank everyone who took
87:44 - time to connect with us live and in
87:46 - person Ah that's really awesome I wish I
87:48 - could have gone but yeah this year I
87:49 - wasn't able to go to GDC it's I'm sure
87:52 - it's been a lot of fun so yeah are any
87:54 - of you at GDC I'd be curious to know so
87:57 - yeah it should be really fun and really
88:00 - uh full of people that's what I remember
88:02 - from GDC of last year how it was so
88:04 - crowded so much stuff so many people
88:05 - everywhere but uh all really awesome
88:07 - definitely very drainy to handle all of
88:10 - those people at the same time but yeah
88:12 - that was really awesome and we had a
88:13 - little uh Meetup at the uh uh verba
88:18 - Buena Garden something like that I don't
88:20 - know that it was last uh last year and
88:22 - it was really interesting so yeah
88:23 - hopefully next year here should happen
88:24 - so yeah can't wait to see you at next CC
88:27 - yeah nice meantime keep creating amazing
88:29 - games oh yeah so lots of stuff here yeah
88:32 - definitely
88:33 - very very interesting lots of
88:35 - information lots of samples you can
88:37 - download right now and download the
88:39 - unity 6 beta I'll definitely be doing
88:41 - that so let me actually put it on
88:43 - install and just install that there you
88:45 - go how big is this one I don't know it
88:48 - doesn't say the size but yeah it's
88:49 - downloading pretty fast so yeah
88:51 - definitely curious to try that out it
88:53 - should be interesting so
88:56 - yeah you've been making a new game for
88:58 - steam well I still have my uh Total War
89:01 - Liberation I still want to get back to
89:04 - that one at some point so we shall see
89:06 - maybe this year and I still want to
89:07 - finish a bunch of things more on
89:09 - thinking Gard so yep we'll use Unity 6
89:12 - yep I'm definitely going to try it out
89:15 - is a 6,000 beta preas yep that is the
89:17 - un6 beta they called it 6,000 I assume
89:20 - it's just to keep the same format of
89:22 - having four digits so what used to be
89:25 - 2023 now it's just going to be the 6,000
89:27 - so yeah pretty much like that should I
89:30 - learn game da which university I'm sorry
89:32 - that's a very local question I have no
89:35 - idea I would say learn from watching
89:38 - channels like mine and others and then
89:40 - find a local University that teaches
89:42 - something although I would probably
89:44 - advise more going into just general uh
89:46 - software development as opposed to
89:48 - specifically game design something like
89:50 - that so yeah it's a it's an interesting
89:53 - question yeah definitely wish you the
89:54 - best in your Learning Journey will you
89:56 - bring more C course yeah I'm still about
89:57 - to still got a bunch of work to do on my
90:00 - on my C course I've actually been
90:02 - building some interactive exercises but
90:04 - uh yeah so the unity 6 road map this was
90:07 - actually it looks quite interesting I'm
90:08 - definitely quite quite interesting in
90:10 - the future especially all this looks
90:12 - really awesome basically making
90:13 - everything run much snappier much better
90:15 - that is 100% a positive thing all right
90:19 - so yeah it's already pretty late over
90:21 - here it's 8:00 p.m. so yeah got to take
90:23 - my do outside do something so yeah this
90:26 - was a fun live stream I mean I I saw the
90:29 - uh video going live and I figured hey
90:31 - doing this on live stream could be fun
90:32 - could be interesting so hopefully you
90:34 - found this a bit more interesting than
90:36 - just watching by yourselves so I hope
90:37 - that you enjoyed this live stream and uh
90:41 - yeah so yeah thank you all so much for
90:43 - being here and I'm going to just move
90:47 - this like that like that and yep all
90:51 - right so yeah thank you all so much for
90:52 - being here hope you enjoyed this and all
90:55 - right uh see you next time everyone
