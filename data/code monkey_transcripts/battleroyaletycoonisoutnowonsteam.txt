00:02 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:04 - and as you know I'm an indie game
00:06 - developer and I've just fully released
00:08 - my latest steam game battle round tycoon
00:10 - out of early acces this has been quite
00:12 - the journey it's the longest I've worked
00:14 - on a game and also the most complex you
00:16 - can pick up the game right now on Steam
00:18 - and see all that I'm teaching here in
00:19 - action so I will now play the short
00:22 - trailer and then talk about the journey
00:24 - to make the game and what's coming on
00:25 - the channel
01:10 - [Music]
01:22 - [Music]
01:31 - all right so there it is
01:34 - the game is finally in version 1.0 I'm
01:36 - really pleased with the end result I
01:38 - think the game has an interesting
01:39 - concept and is well executed of the
01:42 - system's work well with one another and
01:43 - I focused a lot on making it a really
01:46 - pleasant and polished experience going
01:48 - through early access in reading all the
01:49 - feedback has helped me improve the game
01:51 - immensely the game right now is better
01:53 - because of that feedback so if you did
01:55 - pick up the game during early access and
01:57 - wrote a review I'd like to thank you for
01:59 - that the game is better because of you
02:00 - I'm also very pleased with the
02:03 - development of the game and how I
02:04 - managed to organize my code this is
02:07 - really the most complex game I've ever
02:09 - made and managing all that code has been
02:11 - tricky but doable usually when I make my
02:14 - games it feels like good quality always
02:16 - goes down in the end but not in this
02:18 - case I've been adding a ton of features
02:20 - this past week and working in the
02:21 - codebase is still very doable thanks to
02:23 - how everything is cleanly separate so
02:26 - yet another example of just how
02:27 - important it is to keep your code nice
02:29 - and clean if you do it it will help you
02:31 - manage to make more and more complex
02:33 - games I've covered some of the systems
02:35 - on the channel so check the links in the
02:37 - description to understand how such a
02:38 - complex game is made from various
02:40 - separate systems this has also been the
02:43 - longest I've worked on a game I first
02:45 - started in April of last year with an
02:47 - early access release in December and if
02:49 - one release right now so that's a total
02:51 - of 17 months of the fountain part of
02:54 - that is due to complexity but also due
02:56 - to how pretty much at that same time I
02:58 - started this channel and making videos
02:59 - so I've been trying to balance these two
03:01 - full-time jobs and be productive at both
03:04 - as you saw by the unlike of videos these
03:06 - past two months there are times when it
03:08 - really requires extreme focus to get
03:10 - something done and now that the game is
03:13 - done I'll be back to making videos while
03:14 - reading all the feedback and fixing all
03:16 - the issues that might pop up if you
03:19 - followed along the channel this past
03:20 - year then you'll have seen how a game
03:22 - starts from nothing and through constant
03:24 - incremental progress it eventually
03:25 - becomes a complete final game the game
03:28 - is now fully released on Steam and you
03:30 - can get it with a bonus discount if you
03:32 - pick it up through the bundle it applies
03:34 - discount even if you already have all
03:36 - the other games and all the other games
03:38 - are the ones in the code monkey bundle
03:40 - if you do pick up the game then please
03:42 - read a review with your
03:43 - sonot I want to constantly improve as a
03:45 - game developer and reviews also help the
03:47 - game get more visibility on Steam this
03:49 - channel is all about teaching game
03:51 - development so if you're interested in
03:52 - making games I think it's very useful to
03:54 - view how what I'm teaching in these
03:56 - videos is applicable to a real final
03:58 - game so right now my plan is to focus a
04:01 - hundred percent on this channel at least
04:03 - for the next couple of months hopefully
04:05 - you won't like the videos and the
04:06 - channel will grow to become sustainable
04:08 - later this month
04:10 - I'm also heading to unite Copenhagen so
04:12 - I'm looking forward to learning a lot
04:13 - and sharing what I've learned there
04:15 - should be lots of great stuff regarding
04:16 - the feature of unity and now here's my
04:19 - question to you what would you like to
04:21 - see more on the channel more complete
04:23 - game tutorials or more single element
04:25 - u-turns would you like to see more ECS
04:27 - and job stuff more videos on systems
04:30 - from vanuatu goon what about sim
04:32 - tutorials like how odd the workshop may
04:35 - be a game jam maybe something with
04:36 - preset packages so it's easier to start
04:38 - maybe some interactive tutorials or what
04:42 - about a livestream like that test that I
04:44 - did a long time ago I'm really excited
04:47 - about all the potentially awesome stuff
04:48 - I can work on to help you learn how to
04:50 - become a better game developer so do one
04:53 - let me know in the comments what you
04:54 - would like to see this week I'm still
04:56 - busy working on the game making sure
04:58 - that everything is nice and suddenly but
05:00 - I should be back to regular videos by
05:01 - next week and as always many thanks for
05:04 - watching these videos and I hope you
05:05 - like the game alright see you next time
05:20 - you
