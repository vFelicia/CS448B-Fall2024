00:00 - hello and welcome I am your code monkey
00:01 - and in this video we're going to create
00:03 - a very simple mini-map let's begin
00:07 - all right so here's my scene I have a
00:10 - player character with a sword there are
00:13 - some buildings and some enemies I can
00:15 - attack the enemies and kill them okay we
00:18 - want to display the player the enemies
00:21 - and the building in a mini-map in the
00:23 - corner now there are multiple ways to
00:26 - create a mini-map but the absolute
00:28 - easiest one is simply making a camera so
00:30 - let's check out the main camera as you
00:33 - can see the camera is just a basic 2d
00:35 - camera and in here we have a culling
00:38 - mask field this contains all the layers
00:41 - that this camera will render which means
00:44 - anything not selected will not be
00:45 - rendered this is what we need to make
00:47 - our minima so let's first go into our
00:50 - player and inside let's create a new
00:54 - empty game object let's name it mini-map
00:57 - icon and give it a sprite renderer and
01:01 - drag a circle onto it
01:04 - okay let's scale it up a bit and tint it
01:07 - in green okay so this is the green
01:12 - circle that won't be displayed on our
01:13 - mini-map which references the player
01:15 - position and if we run the game you can
01:19 - see that the green circle is on top of
01:21 - the player in the main camera which is
01:23 - not what we want we want to display this
01:25 - on a separate camera okay so let's go
01:27 - back into the editor on our mini-map
01:29 - icon in here we're going to select a new
01:32 - layer so click on layer and add a layer
01:35 - in here let's name our layer mini-map
01:38 - and back in our mini map icon set it to
01:41 - the layer minimum okay
01:42 - so now let's go back into the main
01:44 - camera and on the culling mask which
01:47 - again this is the layers that are
01:49 - rendered by this camera so in here make
01:52 - sure that mini-map is deselected that
01:55 - means that any object that has the
01:56 - minimum layer will not be rendered by
01:58 - this camera okay so let's run the game
02:00 - just for testing and our green dots
02:02 - should no longer appear yet there you go
02:05 - this is our main camera and the game
02:07 - object on the mini-map icon no longer
02:09 - appears okay so now let's make our
02:12 - mini-map camera so let's go into the
02:14 - main camera and duplicate it let's call
02:17 - this mini-map camera first let's remove
02:20 - the main camera
02:21 - so just set this to untagged and now for
02:24 - the culling mask this one will simply
02:27 - display the minima so it's not like
02:28 - nothing and then only the minimum as you
02:31 - can see on the preview we can see our
02:32 - mini-map icon let's make it a child of
02:35 - the main camera so they always have the
02:38 - same position and for depth let's put it
02:41 - on zero which is above the main camera
02:43 - so let's test and see what happens
02:46 - you can see the player position
02:47 - displayed on our mini-map camera and
02:49 - it's moving around as I move okay
02:53 - great so we now have two cameras
02:55 - displaying two specific scenes now
02:57 - obviously we don't want the mini-map to
03:00 - hide our main camera we want it to be
03:01 - displayed in the corner of this screen
03:03 - so for now we're going to use a render
03:06 - texture so let's go into our project
03:08 - files and here let's right click and
03:11 - create a new render texture down here
03:13 - okay let's call it mini-map render
03:16 - texture in here let's give it a size of
03:19 - 512 by 512 so the minimum up isn't very
03:22 - pixelated
03:23 - and let's drag it onto our mini-map
03:26 - camera so this is the camera in here you
03:28 - have a target texture that we can select
03:30 - a render texture and let's drag it into
03:32 - there okay so now let's run the scene
03:35 - and we should be seeing the same as
03:37 - previously yep exactly and if we pause
03:40 - and check out the render texture yep
03:42 - there you go it is displaying what the
03:44 - mini-map camera is seeing okay great now
03:47 - we want to display this very texture on
03:49 - our yuan so let's go to our UI canvas I
03:53 - have it set up in here and let's make an
03:56 - empty game object let's call it minimum
03:59 - render texture and here we're going to
04:03 - add a raw image component we must use
04:06 - the raw image instead of the image
04:08 - component because the image component
04:10 - takes a sprite and what we have here is
04:12 - a texture so using the raw image we can
04:14 - simply drag our texture onto it let's
04:17 - see where that image is being displayed
04:19 - and here's our UI okay let's move it to
04:22 - the side and make it a bit bigger so 200
04:25 - by 200 and as you can see it is
04:27 - transparent which is probably not what
04:28 - we want so what's going to our mini-map
04:31 - and set the background sound color to a
04:33 - dark grey for alpha okay there you go
04:36 - there's a square so let's test and yep
04:39 - there you go here's my player and in
04:41 - there we have a mini-map view the player
04:44 - is moving and as you can see it moves
04:45 - exactly the same okay great
04:47 - now before we add icons to the other
04:50 - elements let's make this look a bit
04:52 - better since this is a UI image we can
04:54 - easily apply a mask and make it look
04:56 - quite a bit better so in here let's
04:58 - first make a container game object for
05:00 - our mini-map window and let's drag our
05:04 - render texture onto it now let's add
05:06 - another UI image this won't be for our
05:10 - masks so add the mask component and
05:13 - let's add a circle mask and hide the
05:16 - mask graphic okay now our mini-map is
05:19 - circular and let's set a border on top
05:21 - of it okay so here we have a circular
05:29 - mini-map with a nice border on top of it
05:32 - so let's run the code and see how it
05:34 - looks
05:34 - yep there's our mini-map it works and
05:37 - now it is circular and has a nice
05:39 - looking border okay great now let's
05:41 - finally add some icons to our other
05:43 - elements so for the building and I have
05:46 - the buildings placed as a prefab so in
05:49 - here I can simply add another sprite to
05:52 - the object a sprite let's call it mini
05:55 - map icon again give it the layer of mini
05:59 - map and for the buildings let's put a a
06:03 - Blue Square okay
06:05 - check out the icon and make it quite a
06:08 - bit bigger okay so now all the buildings
06:14 - have a square for their mini map icon
06:17 - and for the enemy icon again I have the
06:20 - enemy prefab in here so let's add
06:23 - another sprite for our mini map icon
06:27 - again place a layer on mini-map and for
06:31 - the sprite again we don't need to use
06:32 - basic shapes we can use any sprite so
06:35 - let's use the enemy icon sprite and just
06:38 - for fun for the flying dead body let's
06:41 - also add
06:42 - icon all right so let's run the game and
06:47 - see if all of our icons are correctly
06:49 - displayed okay there's the player and if
06:51 - I go there yep there's an enemy right
06:54 - next to me and a building in there and
06:56 - now if I hit the enemy the icon should
06:58 - change yep there you go
07:00 - it shows the other icon now what you
07:03 - might notice that it's not very correct
07:04 - is simply the size of our mini-map
07:06 - usually the mini-map shows more than
07:08 - what you see in the main camera so we
07:10 - need to deal with that and for that let
07:12 - us simply go into our mini-map camera
07:14 - and simply set the orthographic size to
07:16 - be larger so let's say instead of 70
07:19 - which is what is on the main camera
07:21 - let's put it on 200 okay there you go we
07:24 - can now see a much bigger area using our
07:26 - mini-map but as you can see the icons
07:29 - are now very time essentially they have
07:31 - to be scaled relative to the zoom on our
07:34 - mini-map camera
07:36 - all right I have resized the icons and
07:38 - now as you can see the mini-map is much
07:40 - more visible now we can see all the
07:42 - icons and we can view a larger area so
07:46 - there you have it we create a very
07:48 - simple mini-map that displays all the
07:49 - icons that we want to show in the next
07:52 - video we're going to create a few
07:53 - scripts to make the whole mini-map
07:54 - system very easy to use as always you
07:57 - can download the project files and
07:58 - utilities from unity code monkey comm if
08:00 - you have any questions post them in the
08:02 - comments and I'll do my best answer them
08:03 - subscribe for more videos and I'll see
08:05 - you next time
