00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here's an fps that i made
00:03 - entirely using unity visual scripting
00:05 - it's a complete game full of awesome
00:07 - mechanics as well as
00:08 - all of the normal things that you expect
00:10 - from an fps so there's multiple weapons
00:12 - starting with a simple pistol
00:14 - then a shotgun that fires multiple
00:15 - pellets and a rocket launcher that fires
00:17 - slow moving rockets at the undamaging
00:19 - area there's a really cool shield which
00:22 - not only stops but also reflects bullets
00:24 - and also a really awesome hookshot
00:26 - mechanic allowing the player to quickly
00:28 - move around the map in style
00:29 - it's got pickups coins keys doors
00:32 - enemies and ends with an awesome boss
00:33 - fight
00:34 - again all this built internally using
00:36 - visual scripting there isn't a single
00:37 - line of code anywhere
00:39 - the game is really fun to play and
00:40 - everything is built in a premodular way
00:42 - so adding more different weapons or
00:44 - enemy types or extra pickups is really
00:46 - easy
00:47 - the game is part of my complete visual
00:48 - scripting course which includes
00:50 - step-by-step guides on how everything
00:51 - was built
00:52 - it starts completely from scratch with a
00:54 - brand new empty project and goes through
00:55 - step by step until the final game
00:57 - the course contains not just this game
00:59 - but actually three unique games
01:01 - a platformer a action rpg and now a
01:03 - first person shooter
01:04 - it starts off teaching you the basics of
01:06 - unity and visual scripting with the
01:08 - simpon platformer
01:09 - then it ramps up the complexity with the
01:11 - action rpg which is packed full of
01:13 - features
01:14 - and finally ends with this awesome fps
01:16 - which takes all that knowledge and
01:17 - applies it to a 3d game
01:19 - so if you want to learn how to make
01:21 - games using visual scripting then this
01:22 - course is just for you
01:24 - if you have any issues or questions you
01:26 - can post them in the q a section and i'm
01:27 - always there to answer and clarify
01:29 - whatever questions you have
01:31 - alright so thanks for watching check the
01:32 - link in the description to pick up the
01:34 - course and let's build these awesome
01:35 - games together
