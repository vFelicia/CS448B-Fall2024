00:12 - assets even if you don't pick up any of
00:14 - these it's so great to look at them to
00:16 - see if they inspire you to build
00:17 - something just watching some of these
00:19 - assets is enough to fire up my
00:20 - imagination I can minimally picture all
00:22 - of the kinds of games that I could build
00:24 - this one is a list of paid ads and
00:26 - effects I've already made two videos
00:27 - covering the best three new assets and
00:29 - the best songs and systems as always
00:31 - there's links to the apps in the
00:32 - description and as a bonus you can use
00:33 - the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off
00:35 - your order also the two excellent humble
00:38 - bundles are still active they were meant
00:40 - to have ended by now but they were both
00:41 - extended there's a tools bundle and a
00:43 - art model I cover them in detail in
00:45 - previous videos even use some of the art
00:47 - tools to make a very unique art style
00:48 - both have an extremely deep 98 discount
00:51 - so they're worth it if just one asset
00:53 - looks interesting alright so starting
00:55 - off with a pack of gorgeous Sky boxes
00:57 - now skyboxes are one of those time tiny
01:00 - things that can make a huge difference
01:01 - just changing the default Skybox with
01:04 - something proper will make your game
01:05 - feel so much better so definitely make
01:07 - sure you do that then for a really nice
01:09 - animation pack this one is all about
01:11 - wrestling animations there's lots of
01:13 - interesting moves you've got some kicks
01:15 - Jabs grabs a bunch of slams and even
01:17 - some moves against the ropes definitely
01:19 - great for spicing up your melee action
01:22 - game if you want something less human
01:24 - then check out these Elementals it
01:26 - includes 12 Elementals fire magma storm
01:29 - ice and more it's a pretty nice design
01:31 - would make for a great enemy or maybe
01:33 - some creature to populate your world
01:36 - next up if you need a medieval dungeon
01:38 - here's one it's got some very high
01:40 - quality assets everything is super
01:42 - detailed it looks really dark really
01:44 - gloomy great atmosphere there's tons of
01:47 - props and lots of modular pieces for you
01:49 - to build your own unique Dungeons and
01:51 - perhaps feed them to a procedural
01:52 - generator next up a really fun one a
01:55 - professional Stickman pack it's got some
01:58 - very stylized characters includes 15
02:00 - unique ones and it's actually pretty
02:02 - cheap so if you're making some kind of
02:04 - Jolly Co-op game then this would be
02:06 - perfect for it then if all you want is
02:08 - just a massive pack with tons of cars
02:10 - and look at this one in total there's
02:12 - over 100 unique models each with
02:14 - multiple colors features all kinds of
02:16 - cars from muscle cars GT rally some
02:19 - hyper cars and tons more for some
02:21 - effects look at these impacts and hits
02:24 - this would be perfect for adding a bunch
02:26 - more punchiness to your player actions
02:28 - there's lots of color variation that can
02:30 - represent whatever you want so quite a
02:32 - lot of variety then if you need a bunch
02:34 - of Rings look at this one perhaps these
02:36 - would be magical rings with some kind of
02:38 - special powers in your game The Lord of
02:40 - the Rings TV show is about to come out
02:42 - so if you have some interesting game
02:43 - ideas then this could be great if your
02:46 - game is set in Japan here is a great
02:48 - Tokyo Street I definitely would like to
02:50 - go to Japan someday and this looks just
02:52 - like every anime that I've ever seen
02:54 - it's a really nice Street very small and
02:56 - cozy there's tons of props everywhere
02:58 - and all the houses also include
03:00 - Interiors which is pretty nice then if
03:02 - you need the UI kit look at this one
03:04 - it's very dark very gloomy so this would
03:07 - be perfect for something just like
03:08 - Diablo there's lots of Sliders buttons
03:11 - and icons and also there's some bubbles
03:14 - again just like Diablo or Path of Exile
03:16 - and even some fancy bars up next a
03:18 - pretty unique one a female hair
03:20 - collection I don't think I've ever seen
03:22 - a hair pack but it definitely make makes
03:24 - sense changing the hair sound will make
03:26 - a huge difference on all of your
03:27 - characters
03:28 - so this looks like a great pack to add
03:30 - that extra customization to your game
03:32 - then if you'd like to make a city very
03:34 - much like New York look at this one it's
03:36 - very realistic you've got some very tone
03:38 - villainings and some very long streets
03:40 - all of it is very blocky so it would be
03:43 - easy to use this in a modular way to
03:45 - make your own custom City it has a huge
03:47 - simple scene of 500 by 800 meters maybe
03:50 - you're working on a pixel art game if so
03:52 - here's a gorgeous pack I really like the
03:55 - sound on this one it makes me think of
03:56 - into the breach there's lots of mechs
03:59 - buildings and vehicles all of it really
04:00 - nice then for just a single but very
04:03 - high res character here's a hunter
04:05 - Warrior this one is a very unique design
04:07 - I love the mask it has a humanoid ring
04:10 - so you can easily get this character up
04:12 - and running next if you need some drones
04:14 - look at this pack features six big
04:16 - drones five small ones and three extra

05:21 - same assets Road rotating and scaling
05:23 - them and for something quite unique here
