00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - here's a really interesting article
00:03 - titled sustainable living as an indie
00:06 - bottom feeder so basically can you make
00:07 - a living whilst not being a famous Indie
00:09 - Dev this was written all the way back in
00:11 - 2017 and look at that look at the author
00:13 - Yep this was written exactly by me six
00:16 - years ago and this is telling my story
00:17 - so let's read through it and see if
00:19 - everything that I've said back then
00:20 - still makes sense still is applicable
00:21 - nowadays so howdy my name is cardos I'm
00:25 - the developer behind the one man in the
00:26 - studio and on slope Studios and you've
00:28 - probably never heard of me my story
00:29 - isn't sexy I didn't quit my job and work
00:32 - on a masterpiece for five years while
00:33 - living on Ramen I'm not an autor making
00:35 - a game that won't change the world and
00:37 - make people tattoo the name on their
00:38 - forehead my car is 12 years old my phone
00:40 - is 4 years old my apartment is boringly
00:43 - normal on a second world country my
00:45 - games Don't Get Hype previews on kataku
00:47 - or polygon they don't have a
00:48 - metacritosaur they don't get reviewed on
00:50 - IGN or rock paper Shopkin they don't get
00:52 - covered by Turtle biscuit or Giant Bomb
00:54 - but despite all that I've been running a
00:56 - sustainable business since 2013. so yeah
00:58 - right away all of this is still
00:59 - applicable to my myself nowadays I have
01:01 - made over eight games on Steam those
01:04 - games have sold hundreds of thousands of
01:05 - copies they've made over one million
01:07 - dollars in Gross and yet like it says
01:08 - here you've probably never heard of me
01:10 - so most people do not know the name
01:11 - endless loop Studios I am definitely not
01:13 - a famous Dev but I have been doing this
01:15 - as a sustainable business since 2013.
01:18 - and yeah it's funny to read this six
01:20 - years afterwards since then I have
01:21 - upgraded my car I used to have a Hyundai
01:24 - Getz now I've got a nucleo the car is
01:26 - from 2017 so I guess I've got a 60 year
01:28 - old car now my phone I've also upgraded
01:30 - but it's also about four years old now
01:32 - still live in the same apartment still
01:34 - in the same country and if my games
01:36 - still don't get high previews I'm
01:37 - currently working on my next team game
01:39 - dinky Guardians and for that game I
01:41 - highly doubt that it's going to be
01:42 - covered on Kotaku or polygon but I'm
01:44 - still quite confident that it won't be
01:45 - financially viable same so far all this
01:47 - yep still applicable nowadays so let's
01:49 - continue reading here's a nice
01:50 - screenshot from one of my first games
01:52 - gamecorp DX that is one of my most
01:54 - successful games it was made pretty
01:56 - quickly it's a relatively short game but
01:58 - the response was awesome the game is
01:59 - pretty cheap and everybody who buys it
02:01 - the reviews are still insanely positive
02:03 - nowadays so that was a great game so
02:05 - continuing my role models are more than
02:07 - likes of clay fairies from positive
02:08 - games and Jeff vogels spider web
02:10 - software rather than Eric Brown from
02:12 - stardew Valley or Toby Fox from
02:14 - undertale if you're looking to be in
02:15 - developer long term I fully believe the
02:17 - trick is quantity of sufficient quality
02:19 - so you have this ice don't very much
02:20 - agree with the sentiment obviously
02:22 - stardew Valley and undertale and those
02:24 - two are absolute masterpieces but they
02:26 - were also extremely risky gambons both
02:28 - these I think to more than five years
02:30 - each of them to the phone that is really
02:32 - risky spending five years working on
02:33 - just one game of course when it does go
02:36 - well then you get massively rewarded so
02:38 - both these developers they are insanely
02:40 - successful they can do whatever they
02:41 - want basically with one game they
02:42 - essentially won the lottery but
02:44 - personally I do not like to gamble my
02:46 - livelihood on the lottery I prefer more
02:48 - stable things so that is why Cliff
02:50 - Harris he is developer behind democracy
02:51 - so that was a huge hit also made
02:53 - production line also really great he got
02:55 - into publishing and started publishing
02:56 - some games made big Pharma also
02:58 - published created the Space Battles that
03:00 - was another big hit a long time ago
03:01 - we're doing the sync battles that was
03:03 - also interesting and for Jeff Hogan with
03:04 - spider web software there's all kinds of
03:07 - very strange very Niche old-school RPGs
03:09 - he has made a ton of them and over the
03:12 - years has developed a very dedicated
03:13 - audience that buys pretty much any game
03:15 - as long as it fits that Niche there is
03:17 - an excellent GDC tone that I highly
03:19 - recommend you go and look at so like I
03:20 - said here I've only believe the trick is
03:22 - primarily quantity of sufficient quality
03:24 - rather than risking your whole life on
03:26 - pushing the quality as much as possible
03:27 - I'm a big fan of trying to lower the
03:29 - rest so you can actually keep doing this
03:30 - for the long term so as with any
03:32 - business there won't be ups and downs I
03:34 - expected my second game to do as well as
03:36 - the first and as a result I invested way
03:38 - too much time and money and when sales
03:39 - were way below the first one I panicked
03:41 - quite a bit and I became concerned about
03:43 - the viability of indie game development
03:45 - as a sustainable long-term career so
03:46 - yeah this definitely happened to me my
03:48 - first game Survivor Squad was
03:49 - surprisingly successful back then green
03:52 - light had just started so steam wasn't
03:53 - yet as much saturated as it is right now
03:55 - and that game that game idea that
03:57 - concept for some reason that really
03:58 - resonated with people so that game
04:00 - definitely sound a lot more than I
04:01 - expected but the second game server
04:03 - scored gun toys which was a direct
04:05 - sequel that one suddenly did not do as
04:07 - well I worked on that game a lot more I
04:09 - believe it is a better game in literally
04:10 - every single way but for some reason the
04:13 - market didn't like it steam didn't
04:14 - really care for it so that game I think
04:16 - it's only literally one tenth despite
04:18 - taking longer to make and despite
04:19 - investing a lot more time on buying art
04:21 - and all kinds of things so yeah when
04:23 - that second game flew up that really
04:24 - scared me quite a bit and like I said
04:26 - here as a result I did the best safest
04:28 - thing that I could do I spent three
04:30 - months remaking my most successful Flash
04:31 - game and made a tiny cheap highly
04:33 - focused highly polished game which found
04:35 - quite a bit of success which then helped
04:37 - me develop my fourth game and so on that
04:39 - game that I'm talking about that was
04:40 - gamecorp DX which yep the original game
04:43 - the original Flash game was called
04:44 - gamecorp it came out before I started
04:46 - getting into unity and making Steam
04:48 - games so I guess came out in I don't
04:49 - know 2011 maybe 2012 and that game was
04:51 - highly successful in the flash game or
04:53 - rather I should say highly successful in
04:55 - terms of players and gameplays
04:57 - definitely not highly successful in
04:58 - terms of monetary Revenue flash is
05:00 - really difficult The Flash version of
05:02 - the game was actually played six million
05:04 - times that is an insane amount I can't
05:06 - even imagine six million people playing
05:07 - my game but has resulted in financial
05:09 - terms that game only made about a
05:11 - thousand dollars whereas a remake that I
05:13 - made on scene that I sold for three
05:14 - bucks that one made something like a
05:16 - hundred thousand
05:18 - foreign
05:20 - flash was definitely an interesting
05:23 - thing I definitely learned a lot from it
05:24 - but in financial terms it was incredibly
05:26 - difficult okay so here are some tips
05:28 - that have helped me along the way tip
05:30 - number one keep your burn rate as low as
05:31 - possible absolutely great tip I
05:33 - definitely still believe in this
05:34 - nowadays I'll start with the most
05:36 - obvious one although also the most
05:37 - difficult one to use since it is very
05:39 - much based on where you live if I was
05:40 - living in San Francisco spending 4K a
05:42 - month just to stay afloat then I
05:44 - wouldn't be able to do this you can make
05:45 - a decent tight small polish game in six
05:47 - months and if your burn rate is 4K then
05:50 - that one cost you 24K whereas if the
05:52 - burn rate is just a thousand then it
05:53 - will only cost you six thousand so yeah
05:55 - difference between 24K and 6K that is
05:57 - difference between requiring something
05:58 - like 500 sales to make a living versus
06:01 - requiring something like five thousand
06:03 - if you can live on a thousand dollars a
06:04 - month you can make a really tight polish
06:06 - two-hour game for six thousand dollars
06:07 - and assuming the game is of sufficient
06:09 - quality that is an achievable amount to
06:11 - sell say at this one I really do believe
06:12 - this is one of the let's say secrets
06:15 - that have allowed me to become an indie
06:16 - Dev the fact that I live in a relatively
06:18 - low-cost living and personally I don't
06:20 - really spend money on anything I don't
06:22 - really care about buying fancy clothes
06:24 - fancy watches fancy cars whatever I
06:26 - don't really care much for them except
06:27 - when I first moved out of my parents
06:29 - house and I started Living by myself I
06:30 - was living as cheaply as possible and I
06:32 - was living around 750 bucks a month so
06:34 - that is why I managed to essentially
06:36 - become a sustainable in developer If
06:38 - instead I was burning through four
06:39 - thousand dollars a month if I was doing
06:41 - that then it would be much more
06:42 - difficult to just basically stay afloat
06:44 - so here continuing Survivor Squad took
06:46 - 10 months to make I was living with my
06:47 - parents and I didn't really go out much
06:49 - or do anything so my Burden rate was
06:50 - essentially zero dollars yep that's
06:52 - correct I did the programming Art and
06:54 - Design myself I spent 350 bucks on
06:56 - hosting royalty free sound effects and
06:58 - the green light fee so do you think that
07:00 - game was profitable the answer is yes of
07:02 - course of course it was I don't know the
07:03 - number off the top of my head but I'm
07:04 - sure that game made over 50k so again
07:07 - spending 350 bucks and 10 months of my
07:09 - life for 50k that is definitely very
07:11 - easily to make profitable which again
07:13 - would be very different if I had spent
07:15 - 4K a month that would be very different
07:17 - math all of a sudden that would not
07:18 - become profitable so here don't demo
07:21 - your life on the expectation that your
07:22 - game won't sell a hundred thousand
07:23 - copies you might think well Sim has 140
07:26 - million users how hard can it be to sell
07:27 - to just point one percent of that and
07:29 - the answer is that it's extremely hard
07:31 - very very hard always be hyper aware of
07:33 - survivorship bias everyone knows tardy
07:35 - Valley's own millions of copies but
07:37 - nobody knows the 200 other games that
07:38 - were released that month and made either
07:40 - nothing or a very small reasonable
07:42 - amount you can look it seem spy and look
07:43 - at the games in a similar genre and
07:45 - price Point's yours so could you survive
07:47 - to make another game if you sold just 5
07:48 - 000 copies what about 3 000 with the
07:51 - trick only of three companies a day
07:52 - combined with your savings be enough to
07:54 - help you make another game yep these are
07:55 - all still very valid questions nowadays
07:57 - the only difference is that nowadays
07:59 - things are even more difficult so
08:00 - nowadays I'm pretty sure there's a lot
08:02 - more than just 200 games released per
08:04 - month I think unless I checked I think
08:06 - last year there were some like 15 000
08:08 - games so that actually means around a
08:10 - thousand games per month now of course
08:12 - some of those are Chevron wear but a lot
08:13 - of those are actually very high quality
08:15 - games and seem now has a lot more
08:17 - millions of users I don't know what is
08:18 - the total but just recently I think they
08:20 - hit 30 million concurrent active users
08:22 - so the total number of users that is an
08:24 - insane amount but at the same time most
08:26 - of those will only see the top games so
08:28 - most of the 1000 games that come out
08:30 - every single month most people will
08:31 - never see any of those same point of
08:33 - this that I wrote back in 2017 this is
08:35 - definitely still accurate nowadays if
08:36 - anything nowadays it is even more
08:38 - difficult start as small as you can
08:39 - focus on a tiny scope and make a tiny
08:42 - product of good quality players much
08:43 - prefer to have a small 2 hour
08:45 - interesting quality experience rather
08:46 - than a 40 hour messy game with many bugs
08:48 - no polish and a dozen meaningless
08:50 - Channel features your goal should be to
08:51 - design a game that when a player
08:53 - finishes they want more rather than
08:54 - something huge that no one will play
08:56 - because they won't get bored and
08:57 - frustrated within the first hour yep
08:59 - that is some generally very good advice
09:00 - making something small tight and
09:02 - Polished that is going to be much better
09:04 - rather than something that technically
09:06 - has hundreds of hours of gameplay but
09:08 - those are all very low quality however
09:10 - at the same time don't push this to the
09:11 - absolute extreme if you make a game that
09:13 - just has one hour of gameplay even if
09:15 - that gameplay is really excellent that
09:17 - might be not enough to justify whatever
09:19 - cost is for the game there are always
09:21 - going to be some people who play games
09:23 - sub two hours and just refund them but
09:25 - those are usually up wires if your game
09:27 - has at least two hours of content and if
09:29 - those two hours are excellent then those
09:31 - people will probably be very happy and
09:32 - the game can be quite successful and
09:34 - here use Early Access for feedback not
09:36 - for funding Early Access is awesome I've
09:38 - used it for all except my first game
09:40 - getting people to play your game ahead
09:42 - of an official launch is extremely
09:43 - important especially if you're keeping
09:44 - your costs as low as possible and don't
09:46 - want to hire professional testers unless
09:48 - you already have a built-in audience or
09:50 - press valve contacts Early Access is not
09:52 - for funding you will likely not be
09:54 - featured on the popular new release list
09:56 - and will likely only sell a few hundred
09:58 - or maybe 1 000 copies depending on the
10:00 - price however make sure your early asset
10:02 - release is in a decent State as an
10:03 - unknown in developer the simmer V score
10:05 - is the most important thing that will
10:07 - help you selling copies and you must
10:08 - defend their own costs if you're only
10:10 - using internally access with many nasty
10:11 - bugs under the guise of it's just an
10:13 - alpha it says over right on the same
10:14 - page you only get negative reviews and
10:16 - even if you fix those issues within 24
10:18 - hours those reviews will still stay
10:19 - there and keep your score down forever
10:21 - as for feedback be very active in
10:23 - responding to comments and put out
10:24 - updates consistently yep all of this
10:26 - still excellent advice nowadays Early
10:28 - Access is definitely for feedback
10:29 - definitely not for funding if you're
10:31 - going into Early Access with the hopes
10:33 - of getting the funding to actually
10:34 - finish your game that is a terrible plan
10:36 - that will not work nowadays Early Access
10:38 - is even more difficult people are even
10:40 - more demanding so back then back in 2017
10:42 - if you put our game on Early Access
10:43 - people would kind of accept a few bugs
10:46 - here and there and a lack of content
10:47 - whereas nowadays they do not nowadays if
10:49 - you put out something on Early Access it
10:51 - better be extremely well polished so
10:52 - nowadays it does not need to be in a
10:54 - decent state it needs to be in an
10:55 - excellent state with quite a lot of
10:57 - content already and yet like I said back
10:59 - then steam review score is the most
11:00 - important thing and yep that is
11:01 - absolutely true that is still very much
11:03 - correct nowadays if you come out of the
11:04 - gate with only access with a subparent
11:06 - release and if the reviews come out
11:08 - negative coming back from that is
11:09 - essentially impossible and like I said
11:11 - here you won't get negative reviews and
11:13 - even if you fix those issues within 24
11:15 - hours the reviews will likely stay there
11:17 - and keep your score down forever there's
11:18 - certainly something that I know very
11:20 - very well there was one of my games
11:22 - where I actually forgot to add a folder
11:25 - on the Mac build like on the game I
11:26 - forgot to test does the founder exist it
11:28 - just assumed that the founder existed
11:30 - and on the build that I uploaded the
11:31 - same I forgot to add that folder so
11:33 - essentially on Mac the game was homily
11:34 - broken now as soon as the game came out
11:36 - I saw our view right away that said the
11:38 - game was broken on Mac it does not work
11:40 - right away I looked into the logs I saw
11:42 - that was a problem very easy fix so I
11:44 - fixed it super quickly literally within
11:46 - less than one hour of release I fixed
11:48 - that I did respond to that review and I
11:49 - said okay this has been fixed but the
11:51 - person who wrote that review they never
11:53 - bothered to update it so one tiny tiny
11:55 - issue that was fixed within 30 minutes
11:57 - of release even though I did fix it the
11:59 - review is still there it still drags
12:01 - down the score nowadays so reviews are
12:03 - extremely important and going into Early
12:05 - Access does not give you a reason to not
12:07 - worry too much people in Early Access
12:09 - expect the same level of Polish as a
12:11 - final game so absolutely do not use
12:13 - Early Access for funding and absolutely
12:14 - do not go with the mindset of it just
12:16 - announced it says on the same page
12:18 - people do not care if it is their only
12:19 - access people only expect a very well
12:21 - very polished very robust game with tons
12:24 - of content valid in long tail Yep this
12:26 - is extremely important since I look at
12:28 - my business as a long-term Venture I've
12:30 - only been long tail tremendously even my
12:32 - first game Survivor Squad which has a
12:33 - mixed review score still sells a handful
12:35 - of copies every month certainly not
12:37 - enough to live on but it does add up
12:38 - what that really means is that as long
12:40 - as I keep my burn rate low I don't need
12:42 - a game to break even super quickly as
12:44 - long as my costs were low enough that
12:45 - break even is achievable it's only a
12:47 - matter of time Yep this is absolutely
12:49 - true I mean nowadays it has been over 10
12:52 - years since I watched my first team game
12:53 - and it still sounds copies now obviously
12:56 - it doesn't sound too much nowadays the
12:57 - long tail that definitely does go down
12:59 - over time but still nowadays it still
13:01 - probably sells I don't know maybe a
13:03 - hundred bucks a month maybe something
13:04 - like that maybe 50 bucks so either way
13:06 - that game that I made over 10 years ago
13:08 - that one still pays for some groceries
13:10 - nowadays and of course that's only just
13:12 - one game so put all the games together
13:13 - and the long tail can be quite good even
13:15 - though nowadays my last scene game came
13:18 - out all the way back in 2019 so that was
13:19 - quite time ago so my steam Revenue has
13:22 - definitely dropped off quite
13:23 - significantly since all of those years
13:25 - ago but still it is still more than zero
13:27 - so all those games that I made all those
13:28 - years ago they still work nowadays and
13:30 - like I said if my burn rate is low which
13:32 - nowadays it still is it's a bit higher
13:34 - than it was all the way back then but
13:35 - it's not that much higher so the small
13:37 - amount that I still get paid from seam
13:39 - that still helps me cover quite a lot of
13:41 - costs for my daily life take it easy on
13:43 - discounts they are useful tool to find
13:45 - new players at different price points
13:46 - but don't go overboard and bundling your
13:48 - game for one dollar within three months
13:50 - of release just make a quick Buck stay
13:51 - strong and keep your eye on the long
13:53 - term Yep this is another thing as soon
13:55 - as you launch a game you won't get tons
13:56 - and tons of messages and emails from all
13:59 - kinds of obscure bundle sites they won't
14:01 - promise to you bundle your game and
14:02 - sometimes of copies but each of those
14:04 - copies you are only going to get
14:05 - literally something like 10 cents out of
14:07 - each of them and as soon as you bundle
14:09 - the game once some people look at that
14:10 - and they basically assume okay so this
14:12 - is the value that the game is worth
14:13 - nowadays the better strategy is really
14:15 - just discount your game nice and slowly
14:16 - over time once again goes back to what I
14:19 - was talking about the burner it if your
14:21 - burn rate is low and you're okay with
14:22 - spending a bit more time to actually
14:24 - break even if you're okay with that if
14:25 - that is sustainable to you then you can
14:27 - afford to essentially discount much
14:28 - slower so just discount 25 for the first
14:31 - six months then maybe just fifty percent
14:33 - on the second year and maybe on the
14:35 - third year or fourth year maybe you can
14:36 - go all the way down to 75 if you do that
14:38 - it won't take a bit longer to get the
14:40 - revenue but again if you can afford a
14:42 - burn rate over a long time in the end
14:44 - that won't be a better strategy always
14:46 - keep learning and growing yep right away
14:48 - obviously I agree with this I mean
14:49 - nowadays I have the channel and part of
14:51 - the reason why I created this channel
14:52 - was because I really wanted to keep
14:54 - learning things keep doing all kinds of
14:56 - things and I wanted sort of an excuse to
14:58 - force myself to do that so this channel
15:00 - making tutorials covering all kinds of
15:01 - unity and Game Dev content that is
15:03 - pretty much Mike's use to keep learning
15:05 - keep doing things I just think to myself
15:07 - I would like to teach this sort of thing
15:09 - make this sort of mechanic in a tutorial
15:10 - and if I want to teach it in a tutorial
15:12 - I need to know it myself very well so
15:14 - yep I'm definitely still very much a
15:15 - Believer on always keep learning and
15:17 - growing then the game development scene
15:18 - moves at a very fast pace it's seems
15:20 - that the game changes every six months
15:22 - so you have to adapt are you making a
15:23 - platformer with nice art it was easier
15:25 - to send out five years ago making a
15:27 - zombie crafting Survival game easier
15:29 - three years ago a king of the hill game
15:31 - easier one year ago yeah there are
15:33 - definitely some fads that come and go
15:34 - and some genres become way too
15:37 - oversaturated like for example making a
15:39 - platform with nice art nowadays in order
15:41 - to stand out you need to have something
15:42 - on the level of something like cuphead
15:44 - so it has to be that special to really
15:45 - stand out Platformers are a dime a dozen
15:48 - there are millions of them zombie
15:49 - crafting Survival game that one is
15:51 - actually not necessarily A Century I
15:53 - mean there are tons and tons of them but
15:54 - people can't seem to get enough of them
15:56 - so that's a genre that is also very
15:57 - saturated but can still work and King of
16:00 - the Hill game honestly nowadays I don't
16:02 - even know exactly what this refers to
16:03 - was there a big amount of King of the
16:05 - Hill games back in 2017 honestly I don't
16:07 - remember but yeah I guess uh fads come
16:10 - and go game genres appear and disappear
16:11 - nowadays the big one is vampire survival
16:13 - likes there's already a ton of them but
16:15 - there are still some that you find
16:16 - success you should stay up to date with
16:18 - the business side of things but also
16:19 - your own skill are you growing as a
16:21 - programmer artist designer are you
16:23 - becoming faster at producing good
16:24 - content in your engine of choice do you
16:26 - have reusable code so your next game
16:28 - will be up and running faster than
16:29 - before do you have some extra Sprites
16:31 - laying around that could be used to very
16:33 - quickly prototype an interesting idea
16:34 - remember time is money yep look at that
16:36 - so all the way back in 17 I was already
16:38 - talking about the benefits of reasonable
16:40 - code even though this in 2017 this would
16:42 - have been probably before I read code
16:45 - complaint so probably before my skills
16:47 - regarding clean code really massively
16:49 - improved so it's kind of funny that
16:50 - before then I was already seeing the
16:51 - value of it and he has some extra
16:52 - Sprites laying around yep that can
16:54 - definitely help back then I was in too
16:56 - used to using the unity assessor but
16:58 - nowadays there are tons of stuff on the
16:59 - accessor so even if you don't personally
17:01 - have some extra Sprites lying around you
17:03 - can definitely pick them up some things
17:04 - either on the Unis or on some sale or on
17:07 - a Humble Bundle getting assets has never
17:09 - been easier and cheaper so that is great
17:10 - next tip gather the following this is my
17:13 - biggest weakness since I'm not a very
17:14 - social person so I'll just write about
17:16 - the generally accepted device be active
17:18 - in all types of social media I ideally
17:20 - you should spend as much time marketing
17:22 - as you do actually developing so yep
17:23 - that is definitely very good advice and
17:25 - all this is still intrude to myself
17:26 - nowadays I am still not a very social
17:29 - person if you've been following this
17:30 - channel for quite some time you can see
17:32 - how it took me in literally years to be
17:34 - able to gain the confidence to turn the
17:35 - camera on and try out this type of video
17:37 - so as you can see I am actively learning
17:39 - my advice I am actively trying to learn
17:41 - and grow any of social media is still
17:42 - extremely important and since nowadays
17:45 - things are even more difficult than they
17:46 - were back in 2017 Yep this advice about
17:48 - spending as much time marketing as you
17:50 - do developing this is even more accurate
17:52 - now than ever nowadays if you just focus
17:54 - on developing your game nobody want to
17:56 - see it so you do need Marketing in order
17:57 - to actually find the people that won't
17:59 - play and like your game and for that
18:01 - here on YouTube you can do devlogs you
18:03 - can try to gather an audience by making
18:04 - tutorials like I've done although to be
18:06 - fair that does generate a more Game Dev
18:09 - audience rather than a game playing
18:10 - audience so that is not a very good
18:12 - strategy for finding game players but
18:13 - you can do General devlogs you can go
18:15 - the entertainment route kind of like
18:16 - Danny that is very successful and you
18:18 - can obviously experiment with all the
18:19 - the new social medias there have been
18:21 - lots of any devs recently that I found
18:23 - tons of success on Tick Tock so Tick
18:25 - Tock Instagram all kinds of short
18:26 - content nowadays that is really useful
18:28 - so in general keep in mind you should
18:30 - spend almost as much time marketing as
18:31 - you do developing one thing I've done is
18:33 - set up a Nissan letter sign up link in
18:34 - all my games and their websites through
18:36 - it I've gathered about 4 000 emails now
18:38 - that obviously doesn't mean that every
18:39 - time I announce the game I will suddenly
18:41 - sell that many companies but it does
18:42 - mean I'm not only starting from scratch
18:44 - in it that is really good advice
18:46 - nowadays I still have that mailing list
18:48 - so when I recently announced thinking
18:50 - Guardians I did send an email to
18:51 - devilist I can't remember how many
18:52 - people are on there but still it's more
18:54 - than zero so it does help and again
18:55 - focusing on the long term every game I
18:57 - release and every day goes by that list
18:59 - increases little by a little maybe one
19:01 - day I'll get to the point where eclipse
19:03 - is so that is Cliff Aries from pasta
19:04 - games and I'll be able to sell 9 000
19:06 - copies of a game before even hitting
19:08 - scene I think that was the game
19:09 - production line I think he made an alpha
19:11 - before going on to steam and that outfit
19:13 - was massively successful Sam if you do
19:15 - manage to gather a large following and
19:16 - large audience that enjoys your games if
19:18 - you gather that over many many years
19:19 - then things hopefully become easier and
19:21 - easier even if the market does become
19:23 - more and more centering when in doubt
19:25 - follow the TF2 Sniper as the wise man
19:27 - once said professionals have standards
19:29 - be polite be efficient have a plan to
19:31 - kill everyone you meet now we would
19:33 - advise replacing that last part with be
19:34 - prepared and have the plan to survive to
19:36 - fight another day if the worst possible
19:38 - scenario comes past but yeah whatever
19:40 - works for you yeah I would say this is
19:42 - definitely still a line that still
19:43 - resonates with me nowadays basically be
19:46 - professional if Game Dev is meant to be
19:48 - your career then take it as seriously as
19:49 - you take any job that you have an
19:51 - interest in make sure you have high
19:52 - standards with the things that you do
19:54 - and of course be polite there's no
19:55 - reason to respond negatively to anyone
19:57 - even negative reviews although that is
19:59 - quite difficult be efficient so in
20:01 - Practical terms this is why I talk so
20:03 - much about writing good clean code that
20:04 - is one of the best ways to get
20:06 - efficiency in game development and be
20:08 - prepared to have a plan to survive to
20:09 - fight another day that is why I never
20:11 - recommend you just quit your day job and
20:13 - try to bet it all on your very first
20:15 - game you should hopefully be honestate
20:17 - that if you do try to make a game and
20:18 - you're trying to make it successful song
20:20 - you should definitely not be in a
20:21 - position where if that game fails
20:23 - suddenly you go homeless and go hungry
20:24 - so that goes back to reducing your burn
20:26 - rate in order to reduce your risk in
20:27 - order to be able to do this for the long
20:29 - term as you gain experience and
20:30 - hopefully find more and more success in
20:32 - the game development is a very tough or
20:34 - crown business but I believe if you face
20:36 - reality instead of burying your head in
20:37 - the sand and focus on taking calculated
20:39 - risks you can't find success just don't
20:41 - define success as selling 100K units yep
20:43 - once again the same thing that I was
20:44 - saying make sure you lower your risk
20:46 - make sure you don't need an insane
20:47 - amount of units to break even the unless
20:49 - you need the easier it is to find
20:50 - success my next game hyper Knights is
20:52 - leaving early access is Friday I've
20:54 - invested more in this game than ever
20:55 - before but not so much that it will
20:57 - never be profitable feedback has been
20:59 - extremely positive so I'm confident it
21:01 - won't reach my modest goals however I
21:03 - also know that if it sells zero copies I
21:04 - will not be out of a job and serving on
21:06 - the street I won't analyze what went
21:08 - wrong and make an educated decision on
21:10 - what to work on next how long to work on
21:12 - it and how much to spend yeah it's a
21:14 - funny reading this all these years
21:15 - afterwards so hyper Knights that one
21:18 - didn't leave early access and in terms
21:19 - of review views and reviews were still
21:21 - extremely positive it is one of the
21:22 - highest rated games that I've ever made
21:24 - but in terms of sales suddenly it didn't
21:26 - do quite as well as I would like like I
21:28 - said I've invested more in this game
21:29 - than ever before but not so much that it
21:31 - will never be profitable so I did spend
21:33 - quite a lot I hired an artist I worked
21:35 - on it to make all kinds of art make the
21:36 - same page make game art make all kinds
21:38 - of stuff I even got some custom sound
21:40 - and all kinds of other things so I
21:42 - invested quite a bit on this game at
21:43 - least relative to my other games in the
21:45 - end it did not sell quite as much as I
21:47 - would like but given how even though I
21:49 - spent more I didn't necessarily spend an
21:51 - insane amount I think I spent I don't
21:52 - know maybe like 20 30 grand something
21:54 - like that and the game did return just
21:56 - about that so it wasn't a huge hit but
21:57 - it was definitely profitable and again
21:59 - back then this was I don't know my sixth
22:01 - game maybe and like I said I don't
22:03 - really spend much money so all the other
22:04 - games that I made some were successful
22:06 - some were less successful but the ones
22:08 - that were successful since my burn rate
22:10 - is so low I didn't manage to gather
22:12 - quite a lot of nice savings so I was at
22:13 - a point where even a hyper Knight stolen
22:15 - literally zero copies even if that were
22:17 - to happen I would not starve I had
22:19 - enough savings to be be able to survive
22:20 - for another one two three games okay I
22:22 - hope this article provides some
22:24 - perspective on the unless exciting but
22:25 - more reasonable and sustainable type of
22:27 - indie game development thanks for
22:28 - reading alright yeah so here it is this
22:30 - article reading it six years later and
22:32 - yep everything is still pretty much
22:34 - accurate nowadays things are quite a bit
22:36 - more difficult seem is even more
22:37 - centering but this advice is really
22:39 - Timeless advice so yeah it was fun to
22:41 - read through this all over again
22:42 - definitely an interesting article and I
22:44 - definitely hope that reading through
22:45 - this helps you on your own personal Game
22:47 - Dev Journey alright so thanks for
22:49 - watching and I'll see you next time
23:04 - [Music]
23:06 - thank you
