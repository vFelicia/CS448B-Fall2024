00:00 - in this video we're going to create a
00:01 - skill tree to unlock new abilities in
00:03 - unity we're going to create the UI and
00:06 - make each skill have a specific path to
00:08 - be unlocked it will be integrated with
00:10 - the previously made local system in
00:11 - order to get skill points let's begin
00:16 - [Music]
00:20 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:23 - and this channel is all about helping
00:24 - you learn how to make your own games
00:26 - with nf2 torrents made by a professional
00:28 - indie game developer so if you find the
00:30 - video helpful consider subscribing okay
00:32 - so this is what we want to make over
00:33 - here is my player character and I can
00:35 - move them around and in here we have the
00:37 - skill tree as you can see some skills
00:40 - are completely unlocked because they
00:41 - have certain specific requirements so in
00:44 - order to unlock the Earth's shadow first
00:45 - I need to unlock the whirlwind however
00:47 - it is also based on skill points so
00:49 - right now I cannot unlock the whirlwind
00:51 - because I have no skill points now I can
00:53 - spawn some enemies and as you can see
00:56 - when I kill them down here is the
00:57 - experience bar and yet there you go I
00:59 - gain experience for every enemy I kill
01:01 - and once I kill enough there you go I
01:04 - level up and over here we gain one scan
01:06 - point so this is using the unlevel
01:08 - system that we made in a previous video
01:10 - so go check that out and now that we
01:12 - have one scan point we can use it to
01:13 - unlock any of these skills so for
01:15 - example let's unlock the woman Surigao
01:17 - the whirlwind is unlocked and now we can
01:19 - unlock the earth shatter but again we
01:21 - don't have any skill points so let's get
01:22 - some more let's go on some more enemies
01:24 - use the whirlwind and there you go kill
01:27 - them all and over here we get a ton of
01:28 - exp with that exp we get more skill
01:31 - points and now we can unlock more skills
01:33 - once again they have specific paths so I
01:35 - cannot watch this one before I'm walking
01:37 - this one mark that one and now that one
01:39 - down and now spawns more enemies and in
01:42 - this case use earth shatter and there
01:44 - you go take them all out get tons of exp
01:45 - tons of skill points and tons of
01:47 - everything the whirlwind and the earth
01:49 - shatter are actually the same skills
01:50 - that I use in hyper nights that game is
01:53 - included in the game and also go pick it
01:54 - up to play it so just like that over
01:57 - here we have our nice game mode fully
01:58 - working so we go out we kill a bunch of
02:01 - enemies so there you go just kill them
02:03 - all take them all out and as we kill
02:05 - them we gain some exp with the XP we
02:07 - level up we gain some skill points you
02:09 - spend some points in order to get some
02:10 - new skills and then we kill more enemies
02:13 - get more skill points more level more
02:15 - exp more skills and more everything so
02:17 - here we have our awesome mini game this
02:19 - video is made possible thanks to these
02:21 - awesome supporters go to
02:22 - patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to
02:25 - get some perks and help keep the videos
02:26 - free for everyone alright so this our
02:28 - goal let's get to it okay here we are in
02:31 - our starring team I have my player
02:33 - character
02:33 - that I can move around and I have some
02:35 - enemies being spawned down here you can
02:38 - see the experience bar as I kill enemies
02:40 - it goes up and with enough exp the
02:43 - character and levels up so this was made
02:47 - in the unlevel system and it's what
02:48 - we're going to use in here in order to
02:50 - generate skill points all right so this
02:52 - is our start now back in the editor
02:54 - let's begin making the UI visual so over
02:57 - here on our canvas let's make a new UI
03:00 - call this our UI skill tree and in here
03:05 - let's just build a very basic button all
03:14 - right so here's our very basic button
03:16 - now for handling clicks I'm going to add
03:18 - the button UI component this is part of
03:21 - the code monkey Toby's that you can grow
03:23 - up for free from unity code Macomb this
03:25 - is a very simple component it just
03:26 - handles a bunch of Mouse interactions
03:28 - now let's make the script to handle our
03:30 - skill tree window so on our scripts
03:32 - folder let's create the new one and call
03:34 - it our UI skill tree and let's drag it
03:37 - in okay now in here let's just grab a
03:40 - reference to our button so when we click
03:48 - we're going to execute this action in
03:50 - here and for now let's just do a simple
03:52 - debug model all right that should do it
03:55 - let's test so here we are and click and
03:57 - we go we have our click alright so far
03:59 - so good
04:00 - now let's test and lock in a specific
04:01 - skill here the player is managed by this
04:04 - script as you can see it's pretty simple
04:06 - just sixteen lines long and then here
04:09 - we're taking care of the experience bar
04:10 - and matching it with the other level
04:12 - system then down here we have a bunch of
04:14 - functions that we're going to use for
04:15 - unlocking our skills so we have a
04:17 - function to test if we can use the earth
04:19 - shatter or warm wind or set a different
04:22 - movement speed and health amount max so
04:24 - now when we click on button let's invoke
04:26 - a specific skill however we do not want
04:28 - to do that directly we don't want to
04:30 - play a class to directly interface with
04:31 - the UI so for that let's make a proper
04:34 - class to handle all of our skills so
04:36 - here we make a new c-sharp script and
04:38 - let's call this our player skills here
04:41 - let's make this a very simple function
04:43 - so you get rid of everything including
04:45 - model behavior all right
04:46 - have a simple basic class and first of
04:49 - all it's making a noon to define all of
04:51 - our skills and for starters let's just
04:54 - try out the earth chatter then let's add
04:56 - a function to unlock a specific skill so
05:00 - this is the function that we're going to
05:01 - call from the UI in order to and welcome
05:04 - let's just keep track of all the ones
05:05 - that are already unlocked
05:09 - so we have a list of skill types and on
05:12 - our constructor we simply initialize our
05:14 - list then when we have the unlock we
05:16 - simply go into our list and we add our
05:18 - News compiled all right very simple now
05:22 - let's have a function in order to test
05:23 - if a specific skill type has been
05:25 - unlocked and now we do is we ask the
05:33 - list if it contains this particulars
05:34 - counter all right so here we have a very
05:36 - simple class to handle all of our player
05:38 - skills and now we can go back into our
05:40 - play class and then here let's go all
05:43 - the way up here to make a field for our
05:44 - player skills and then awake we
05:47 - initialize it all right and now down
05:51 - here on our function where we test if we
05:53 - can use the earth shatter we're going to
05:55 - ask the player skills class if the skill
05:57 - was involved and we're going to pass in
05:59 - the earth shatter all right so that's it
06:01 - now we have a specific class dedicated
06:03 - to handling all of the player skills now
06:06 - all we need to do is make sure that our
06:07 - UI interfaces with this function so to
06:10 - do that let's make a script to handle
06:12 - our connections back in the other term
06:13 - let's make a new c-sharp script call it
06:16 - our testing and make a game object to
06:18 - hone our script and drag the script onto
06:21 - it okay now in here let's add a field
06:23 - for the u.s. country as well as the
06:25 - player so we have references to our
06:31 - player and to our UI skull tree now we
06:33 - want the skill tree to interface with
06:35 - the players player skills so let's go
06:37 - into the UI skill tree and in here let's
06:40 - make a function to receive the player
06:41 - skills
06:45 - okay we have this function which
06:47 - receives our player skills and we set
06:49 - our internal field and then when you
06:52 - click on the skill we go into our player
06:54 - skills and we call unlock skill and we
06:56 - unlock the earth shatter all right so
07:00 - now we need to call this so for that
07:02 - here on testing we go into the UI skill
07:04 - tree and we can't set all your skills so
07:06 - now we need a reference to our player
07:07 - skills so let's going to the player and
07:09 - here and let's make a function to return
07:11 - this field all right so here we will
07:16 - return the player skills and now on
07:18 - testing we set it on the UI tree and we
07:20 - grab it from the player all right so all
07:23 - this should be working essentially we
07:25 - made a class to handle all of our skills
07:27 - so this class is only one responsibility
07:29 - then the player class holds an instance
07:32 - of our player skills and then we have
07:34 - the UI which interacts with the player
07:36 - skills that it receives so if our code
07:38 - is nicely separated and everything
07:40 - should be working
07:41 - what's test ok here we are and the earth
07:43 - shadow skill is on a button and I'm
07:46 - pressing the button and note nothing is
07:48 - happening so the skill is currently
07:50 - locked now let's click on this button
07:52 - and now we have unlocked the skill and
07:54 - press the button again and there you go
07:56 - there's my earth shatter skill so just
07:58 - like this we managed to unlock a skill
07:59 - by pressing a button on the UI awesome
08:02 - so with the structure that we built here
08:04 - we already have our 1 skill and we can
08:06 - easily unlock a bunch more skills so
08:08 - let's add the rest all right so here
08:15 - I've added more inium films for the
08:16 - remaining skill types now let's make the
08:19 - UI visuals
08:35 - all right so here I have had a bunch
08:38 - more buttons so we have the movement
08:40 - seed movement speed to health one how to
08:42 - the whirlwind and the earth shatter and
08:44 - now in our player scale we already have
08:46 - our e-news just one thing over here on
08:49 - the unlock we're currently adding always
08:51 - no matter what so let's do a simple
08:53 - check to make sure the skill isn't
08:54 - already unlocked in case we accidentally
08:56 - unlock it twice so if it is not yet
09:00 - unlocked then we unlock it okay now we
09:03 - need to call this function so on the UI
09:05 - is country let's decode for all the
09:07 - other buttons alright so here we're just
09:16 - calling a simple function on the mouse
09:18 - click ok and now back in the player in
09:21 - here and let's send all the skills so
09:23 - here on the whirlwind let's use the same
09:25 - thing that we did on the earth shatter
09:27 - but in here we use this one okay
09:29 - so these two are working but now for the
09:32 - movement speed and health amount it's a
09:34 - bit different we need to actively no
09:35 - windows get unlocked so what's going to
09:38 - our player skills and in here let's make
09:40 - an event so here we have an event on
09:44 - skill on what and let's also make an
09:47 - event aargh so we can pass in what skill
09:49 - we unlocked so we have our event passing
09:54 - enough type on skill unlock the event
09:56 - args which contains a skill type so now
09:59 - let's call this event so down here when
10:01 - we unlock we add it to the list and then
10:03 - we fire off the infant so invoke with
10:06 - this and the new unlock cards then we
10:08 - pass in the skill type as our skin type
10:13 - alright so we have this event being
10:15 - fired whenever the scale gets and what
10:17 - so you can go back into the player and
10:19 - now we go all the way up here when we
10:20 - are in sin cheating our player skills
10:22 - let's subscribe to the on skill unlocked
10:24 - event and now when that happens let's do
10:27 - a switch on our skill type in case we
10:31 - have for example the move speed one then
10:34 - here and let's modify our things so we
10:35 - use this function in order to set our
10:37 - movement speed so on move speed one
10:41 - let's put it and let's say at 65 and
10:43 - then
10:43 - sweetu another all right now for the
10:47 - hump max alright so this should be
10:55 - working so what we did was we added some
10:58 - more enum values onto our skin types
11:00 - then we're unlocking those skills
11:02 - through this function which gets called
11:04 - through our UI and on the UI we also
11:06 - built the various buttons so then when
11:09 - this function is called and we unlock a
11:10 - skill we fire off an event and then on
11:13 - the player we are listening to that
11:14 - event and when that happens if it's a
11:17 - move speed or health max we modify that
11:19 - one immediately and if not then we have
11:21 - the functions asking if we can use our
11:23 - skills and if so we just has the player
11:25 - skills if the skill is unlocked all
11:27 - right so all that should be working
11:29 - let's test ok here and I'm going to try
11:32 - to do the earth shatter and nope can't
11:34 - do it the whirlwind nope and here I got
11:36 - the normal movement speed and the normal
11:39 - health bar so now let's unlock the
11:40 - whirlwind and now I hit it and there you
11:43 - go there's the warm wind skill now
11:45 - unlock the earth chatter and use a skill
11:47 - and there you I can use it now let's
11:49 - unlock the movement speed so this is in
11:50 - our movement speed click it and there
11:53 - you go now it's a bit faster and
11:54 - movement speed too and there you go now
11:56 - it's quite a lot faster now for the help
11:58 - there you go the health bar and that and
11:59 - walking it's a bit bigger and that and
12:01 - it's a bit bigger alright so here we
12:04 - have all of our skills being unlocked
12:05 - awesome so just like this our skill tree
12:08 - is already looking great now one thing
12:10 - that is usually common in skill trees is
12:12 - having a certain path so certain skills
12:14 - have other requirements before they can
12:16 - be unlocked so let's do that over here
12:19 - in our player skills let's simply make a
12:21 - function that will return the
12:23 - requirements for a particular skill so
12:25 - for example the health max 2 will have a
12:27 - requirement of health max 1
12:38 - all right so we have our requirement and
12:41 - now here we have a particular issue due
12:42 - to the fact that we're working with in
12:44 - ohms so that is how we're going to deal
12:46 - with skills that do not have any
12:47 - requirement so the very first ones when
12:50 - approach would be to make this knowable
12:52 - and we could then return null this would
12:55 - work but honestly it doesn't look very
12:56 - good so instead let's keep it to
12:58 - returning a scum type and then we go up
13:00 - here and we simply have the first come
13:02 - type as our default none so this
13:04 - represents no scale type and then here
13:07 - we simply return that all right so we
13:10 - have our get scale requirement and now
13:12 - let's make a function to try to unlock a
13:14 - certain skill so the UI won't use this
13:19 - function instead of the one that
13:20 - actually unlocks it so we can make this
13:22 - one private and now here let's get the
13:25 - requirement for the skill so we have our
13:30 - requirement then we check if the
13:33 - requirement is not none so if we do have
13:37 - requirement then we check if is skill
13:40 - and whopped if the requirement has been
13:42 - unlocked and if so then we can indeed
13:45 - unlock this skill and if it has no
13:49 - requirement then of course we can unlock
13:51 - it but if it has a requirement and the
13:54 - requirement is not unlocked then we
13:56 - cannot unlock it now let's make this
13:58 - return a boolean in order for the UI to
14:00 - know if the skill was unlocked or not so
14:03 - here if we can well let's return true
14:05 - and if we can't unlock then we return
14:08 - false
14:09 - all right so now we have a function
14:11 - which tries to unlock the skill now
14:13 - let's go into our UI and in here as you
14:15 - can see we got our read error since this
14:18 - one is now private instead we need to
14:20 - use the try and a lot of skill so we
14:22 - replaced all those just like that and
14:25 - now this function you may return a
14:26 - boolean in case it succeeds or fails so
14:29 - you can use that in order to show a nice
14:31 - tooltip warning
14:35 - so here I'm using the tooltip warning
14:37 - which was made in a previous video so go
14:40 - check that out and now let's just apply
14:42 - to Alden now here we should really clean
14:47 - up this code since all of this has a lot
14:49 - of duplicated code but for now it should
14:51 - work just for testing so let's test it
14:53 - out okay so here we are now let's try to
14:56 - and while come to read way so I click
14:58 - and there you go I have an error I
14:59 - cannot unlock it since it has this one
15:01 - as a requirement so first and lock this
15:03 - one there we go the hump bar increased
15:05 - and now I can lock this one and there we
15:06 - go it worked so if i unlock movements
15:08 - feet to right away it doesn't work get
15:10 - the first one then the second one and if
15:11 - there you go just like that
15:13 - alright so with this we have our skill
15:15 - requirements working awesome
15:17 - now let's handle the UI visuals so here
15:20 - in the editor we're going to first show
15:21 - the unlock skills in black and white and
15:23 - low alpha and the skills that we can
15:25 - unlock in black and white with foam
15:27 - alpha and the unlock skills with normal
15:29 - colors so here in the project files I
15:31 - have a black and white shader so here it
15:34 - is very simple we just have our main
15:36 - texture we sample it then we use a
15:38 - saturation notes at the saturation to
15:40 - zero then we take the RGB we multiply it
15:43 - by a certain alpha we combine it all and
15:46 - we pass it into our sprite master node
15:47 - so now let's make our two materials so
15:54 - we have the skill marked and a skill
15:56 - unlockable now we're going to appoint
15:58 - this dynamically so let's go into our UI
16:00 - script and up here let's add our fields
16:05 - so we have our films for the skill mark
16:07 - material any unlockable material so here
16:10 - in the editor and let's drag our
16:11 - references okay good
16:13 - now let's make a update visuals function
16:16 - in here we test if the player skills
16:19 - lets us if a certain skill is unlocked
16:22 - so let's as the earth shatter if so then
16:25 - we go into the image on the UI and we
16:31 - modify the material and we set it to
16:34 - null so that it uses the default so if
16:37 - it isn't well then we set the default if
16:39 - it is not a lock then we need to ask if
16:42 - we can unlock it
16:49 - so we asked if we can unlock if so we
16:52 - use this material if not then we use
16:53 - this one so now let's just make this
16:55 - function so here we're just doing pretty
17:02 - much same logic as in here so we can now
17:05 - simplify this one to use this one all
17:12 - right so here we have it we have a nice
17:13 - function to ask if we can unlock so the
17:16 - UI skill tree we're using that one in
17:18 - order to define what material we should
17:19 - use so now we just need to actually
17:21 - update our visuals so we're going to
17:24 - update first of all when you receive the
17:26 - player stones we update it and then when
17:28 - we get the player skills we're also
17:29 - going to subscribe to the on skill
17:32 - unlocked event and when that happens we
17:34 - also update our videos all right so this
17:36 - should be working and we should be able
17:38 - to see the earth shadow button working
17:39 - correctly so let's test ok so here we
17:42 - are and here four stars it starts off
17:44 - black and white and transparent so it
17:45 - means it's completely locked and we
17:47 - cannot unlock it so first we unlock the
17:49 - one and there you go now it's just black
17:51 - and white and full so meaning that we
17:52 - can unlock it now we click we unlock it
17:55 - and now it's full color so now it says
17:57 - that it's already unlocked all right so
17:59 - we have a very visual indicator of which
18:01 - skills we can unlock now let's apply the
18:03 - colors also to background and to all the
18:06 - other skills
18:45 - all right so here I've refactor the code
18:48 - in order to have the same behavior for
18:50 - all the buttons but not have so much
18:52 - code copy pasting so I created a simple
18:55 - class to represent a single skill button
18:57 - and in here we have the update visual
18:59 - instead of having up here for every
19:01 - single one then we have instances of
19:03 - skill button and we update our visual
19:04 - and then in here we receive our
19:06 - transform the player skills and so on so
19:08 - we're doing exactly the same thing but
19:10 - our class is now much more clean so now
19:12 - let's test this out and everything
19:13 - should be working all right here we are
19:15 - and yet we have a visual difference
19:17 - between the ones that can be unlocked
19:19 - and ones that are still locked so now
19:21 - for example let's unlock our movement
19:23 - speed 1 and there you go that one turned
19:24 - into color and now that one is available
19:26 - so I can unlock it yep just like that so
19:28 - unlock that one yep its unlock now I can
19:30 - unlock this one and just like that
19:32 - alright so here we have our lock and
19:35 - unlock system working awesome now let's
19:37 - add some lines so we can see the unlock
19:39 - path so first let's add them over here
19:42 - in the editor
19:55 - all right so here I have added the three
19:57 - lines for our three and links between
19:59 - the skills now let's go into our script
20:01 - and here let's make a class to hem all
20:03 - our connections inside we have filmed
20:07 - for the skill time and the image array
20:09 - for our connections and then art for
20:15 - this class you show up in the editor we
20:17 - need to add the attribute serializable
20:20 - okay just like that and now all the way
20:23 - up here let's have an array of skill
20:25 - unlock paths and now we can go back in
20:31 - the editor so here's our script and we
20:33 - have our skill unlock pathway so we're
20:35 - going to have three unlock paths so for
20:37 - example the first one for movement speed
20:39 - two and we're going to have one image
20:41 - which is this one in here now the same
20:44 - for the rest all right we have our
20:45 - references now we go down into the
20:48 - visual function and let's first make
20:51 - them all dark so first we darken on the
21:06 - links and then afterwards we go through
21:08 - them again so here we have the skill
21:17 - that is either unlocked or can be
21:19 - unlocked so here let's show with the
21:21 - gold color
21:24 - alright so that's about it and now here
21:27 - I have these two textures the normal
21:29 - line and line glow so let's also use
21:31 - that to make it even more impactful
21:38 - alright let's test okay so here we are
21:41 - and yet we can see that our links are
21:42 - all dark and now if i unlock this one
21:45 - there you go now it becomes visible so
21:46 - now it's much more clear that i can now
21:48 - unlock this one so what this one there
21:50 - you go it changes and it changes alright
21:52 - awesome okay so here we have pretty much
21:55 - our entire skill tree working now
21:57 - finally just for fun I'm going to
21:59 - implement the eleven system that we made
22:01 - previously so we can level up to get
22:03 - skill points that we can then use
22:12 - so here I've added a indicator for these
22:15 - skill points on the UI so here we have
22:17 - these skill points text and now here on
22:19 - the player script it already has the
22:21 - unlevel system and the own level system
22:23 - fires off an event when the own level
22:24 - changes so here's where we're setting
22:26 - the indicator for the on level text in
22:28 - order to see how the own level system
22:29 - works make sure you check out that video
22:30 - so here we can handle getting some skill
22:33 - points so let's go into our player
22:35 - skills in order to store a certain
22:37 - number of skill points and here we got a
22:39 - private in just a something very simple
22:42 - and a function to add them and on the
22:48 - player when the player levels up we go
22:50 - into our player skills and we add news
22:52 - comfort now on the player skills when we
22:55 - try to and welcome let's make sure that
22:56 - we have enough skill points so when you
22:59 - try run/walk we test if we can unlock
23:01 - based on the requirements then we also
23:03 - test if skill points are more than zero
23:05 - then we reduce our skill points and we
23:07 - unmoor all right here it is now we just
23:12 - need to deal with the visual for its
23:13 - components so like always let's make a
23:15 - nice event to keep our code nice and
23:16 - clean so you have a simple event and
23:20 - when we add a stem point we invoke it
23:22 - and we do the same when we spend one so
23:27 - down here when we are spinning we fire
23:29 - off this event alright great so now on
23:32 - the UI lets get that visual
23:52 - all right so here it is very simple when
23:55 - we set the player skills we subscribe to
23:57 - the event and we update like we always
23:58 - do
23:59 - ok so let's test ok so here we are and
24:02 - we currently are on level 1 so we have 0
24:05 - skill points so even though technically
24:06 - we can unlock this skill because it has
24:08 - no requirements we don't have these
24:09 - skill points so if you try to click nope
24:11 - we cannot unlock it
24:13 - so now let's spawn some enemies and
24:15 - there you go hit him and one more and
24:17 - there you go now we need one more so
24:20 - let's spawn some more and there you go
24:21 - now we are in level 2 and yet we have
24:23 - one skill point so take these out and
24:25 - now we can try to spend it so let's
24:26 - click and there you go we've unlocked
24:28 - the whirlwind and now again we got no
24:31 - more skill points so let's once more
24:33 - enemy
24:33 - now let's seize the whirlwind kill them
24:35 - all and there you go and lots of skill
24:37 - points and yep they're there now unlock
24:39 - the earth shatter
24:40 - let's spawn a bunch more enemies and use
24:42 - the earth shattering there you go and we
24:44 - can walk a bunch more just like that
24:46 - alright so here we have our nice game
24:49 - loop fully working so we have a level
24:51 - system and a skill tree we have our
24:53 - skill point so we cannot spend them if
24:55 - we don't have them then we spawn some
24:57 - enemy so we go out we kill some enemies
24:58 - by killing some enemies we get some
25:01 - experience with enough experience we get
25:03 - and level up within level up we get some
25:05 - skill points with some points we can
25:07 - unlock new skills so you can spawn more
25:09 - enemies kill them get more exp more
25:12 - levels more skill points and spend them
25:14 - all on everything so just like this we
25:17 - have our nice skill tree with our very
25:18 - skills working in tandem with the
25:20 - unlevel system our skill tree also has
25:22 - previous requirements so we can make
25:24 - some very specific unlock paths alright
25:27 - so once again here it is our awesome
