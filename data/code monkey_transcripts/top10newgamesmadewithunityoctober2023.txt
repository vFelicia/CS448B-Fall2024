00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made with un launch in October 23
00:05 - I think this was actually one of the
00:06 - toughest months ever usually when I go
00:08 - through the new release list I find
00:10 - about 15 to 20 games that look
00:11 - interesting and then cut them down to
00:13 - just 10 but this time there were over 30
00:15 - that look really awesome really unique
00:16 - it was definitely really tricky to get
00:18 - them down to just 10 and a lot of these
00:19 - actually have overwhelmingly positive
00:21 - reviews which is an insanely difficult
00:23 - score to get the reason why I make these
00:24 - videos is to show you everything the
00:26 - engine can do the only limit is really
00:27 - just your own skills and Imagination and
00:29 - the variety and the awesomeness of the
00:30 - game shown here really puts out to the
00:32 - test all of these games are inally
00:33 - impressive so the list in no particular
00:34 - order except for the number one game
00:36 - that is my personal pick the most and of
00:37 - course let me start off by mentioning my
00:39 - own game which also came out in October
00:40 - I don't want it to take up a slot on the
00:42 - list itself so this is an honorable
00:43 - mention it's a fun game with automation
00:45 - Colony building and defense mechanics
00:47 - where you build a colony automate it and
00:49 - keep the tiny defenseless dinky safe
00:50 - from harm you then colonize other
00:52 - planets gather more resources with the
00:54 - ultimate goal of colonizing every planet
00:55 - and automating everything so your
00:57 - dinkies can finally relax it's out now
00:59 - and seam I hope hope you like it and
01:00 - please make sure to write review your
01:01 - thoughts also right now you can get a
01:03 - free asset on the assur it's a really
01:05 - great basic animation pack now
01:07 - Technically when this video goes live
01:08 - the sale will have changed however the
01:10 - last time that I mentioned this people
01:12 - said in the comments that you could
01:13 - still use the coupon even after the sale
01:14 - changes so just search for this pack
01:17 - basic motions and use the coupon Kevin
01:18 - Legasus and it should be free let me
01:20 - know if this does work and whatever new
01:22 - s happens by the time this video goes
01:24 - live that one will probably also have a
01:26 - free asset I don't know what it's going
01:27 - to be but it should be free using
01:28 - another coupon all right so starting off
01:30 - at number 10 with a game that is
01:32 - seriously blowing up it's called outpath
01:34 - this one had one of the most successful
01:36 - demos of the last seam festival and that
01:38 - demo success definitely translated into
01:40 - massive sales success the game is
01:41 - basically the definition of the word
01:43 - satisfying it's a nice exploring
01:45 - crafting building game with an
01:46 - interesting 3D style features lots of
01:48 - very satisfying animations and sound
01:50 - effects one thing that I heard about
01:52 - this one that made me immediately
01:53 - interested is when someone described it
01:55 - basically as forager in 3D I absolutely
01:57 - loved forager that's another game where
01:59 - it's just just so insanely satisfying
02:01 - every action feels so good and this one
02:03 - seems very much like it but in 3D which
02:05 - certainly changed things you start off
02:06 - on a tiny Island and gather some basic
02:08 - resources but after a while you expand
02:10 - and expand until you have this massive
02:12 - island with tons of buildings and
02:13 - resources all over the place if you like
02:15 - building crafting games and this is
02:16 - definitely one you can't miss it's out
02:18 - now and in less than a month already has
02:20 - almost a th000 overwhelmingly positive
02:22 - views at 95% positive that's insane then
02:25 - here we have a really unique one it's a
02:27 - motor Vania called Leica H3 blood so
02:30 - it's a Metro Vania but you drive a bike
02:33 - definitely very unique concept I don't
02:34 - think I've ever seen anything like this
02:36 - and on top of that it's actually western
02:37 - themed so this looks like a really weird
02:39 - mix of genres visuals and mechanics but
02:41 - based on reviews it really does work
02:43 - you've got all kinds of abilities and a
02:44 - weapon to take down enemies you can do
02:46 - an air Dash while driving your bike then
02:48 - in midair fire your shotgun and watch as
02:50 - the enemies turn into a mist of blood
02:51 - the controls look really nice and fluid
02:53 - it's all in a sid scrolling perspective
02:55 - with some ramps that allow you to make
02:57 - some really nice tricks and the movement
02:58 - is also a mechanic itself you can Parry
03:00 - bullets if you block them with the
03:01 - underside of the bike so that involves
03:03 - lots of twisting lots of back flips in
03:05 - order to both survive and attack the
03:06 - enemies vehicle games are actually
03:08 - usually Prett Niche but this one is
03:10 - finding massive success it is out now
03:11 - and already has a th000 overwhelming
03:13 - positive views at 95% positive next if
03:16 - you're looking for a Sci-Fi super
03:18 - fast-paced FPS Rog light then check out
03:20 - battle Shapers it features some real
03:22 - intense action with a multitude of
03:24 - weapons and abilities being a Rog light
03:26 - means you go on multiple runs you can
03:28 - make your build from tons of unique
03:30 - weapons and defeat some really
03:31 - interesting enemies your right hand
03:32 - holds your weapon whilst the left hand
03:34 - controls your abilities or simply
03:36 - punches some enemies for every boss you
03:38 - defeat the next run becomes much harder
03:39 - you can do all of this while looking
03:41 - awesome in this excellent visual style
03:43 - someone mentioned in the reviews that
03:44 - this game is basically what would happen
03:46 - if Mega Man and doom had a baby so if
03:48 - that sounds interesting definitely give
03:49 - it a shot it is out now in Early Access
03:51 - with 150 very positive viws then here's
03:54 - one where honestly I'm interested just
03:56 - based on the name it's called wizard
03:57 - with a Gun there's certainly something
03:59 - to be said about coming up with a funny
04:01 - unique interesting name for your game if
04:03 - you come up with something like this
04:05 - then just having an interesting name
04:06 - will make marketing the game so much
04:08 - easier but thankfully for this one it is
04:09 - not just an interesting name the game
04:11 - itself also looks great it describes
04:13 - itself as an online sandbox Survival
04:15 - game for up to one or two players it's
04:17 - very much along the lines of Don't
04:18 - Starve which for me don't starve is one
04:20 - of my favorite games I played it all the
04:22 - way back when it was a game that you
04:23 - played on Chrome and back then I loved
04:25 - it so based on that comparison alone I'm
04:27 - already interesting you explore this
04:29 - world in nice 2D 3D style like name
04:31 - implies you've got a gun but obviously
04:33 - you have tons of customization to make
04:35 - that gun exactly as you want it tons of
04:37 - upgrades and unique ammo that you can
04:38 - craft by gathering resources from the
04:40 - world you can make bullets that go
04:41 - through enemies or bullets that return
04:43 - to the player or maybe Grant your life
04:45 - or poison enemies your gun is also how
04:47 - you build things which is certainly
04:48 - unique there are some areas you can only
04:50 - access after you use your gun to build a
04:52 - bridge the game is very systems heavy
04:54 - and with all kinds of creative
04:55 - combinations you can experience things
04:56 - the developers never imagine you can
04:58 - play either Solo or along side of friend
05:00 - it is out now with almost a thousand
05:01 - very positive reviews then this month
05:03 - there was a surprising amount of really
05:05 - great XCOM likes this is the one that I
05:07 - picked called cyber Knight flasho it's
05:09 - an XCOM like so it's turn-based you've
05:11 - got multiple controllable units various
05:13 - weapons and abilities all in a really
05:15 - interesting cyberpunk world so lots of
05:17 - hackers and futuristic weapons build up
05:19 - your base with all kinds of unique
05:21 - buildings that allow for research
05:22 - crafting and a bunch more then check out
05:24 - the world map to see where you'd like to
05:25 - go next pick your next mission carefully
05:28 - once you go in take advantage of the
05:29 - stealth mode before you engage position
05:31 - your units accurately so that when you
05:33 - finally go all out you can take out a
05:35 - ton of enemies at once setting up
05:36 - ambushes was always my favorite part of
05:39 - XCOM so I really love how this game
05:40 - seems to have a nice focus on that
05:42 - engage with unique factions and
05:43 - interesting stories to explore this
05:45 - world outside of combat but then take
05:47 - your best soldiers and complete the
05:48 - mission it is out now in Early Access
05:50 - with a little bit of a muted release
05:52 - with only 70 reviews but they are all
05:53 - very positive next for some VR here we
05:56 - have a fun one called Under Pressure
05:57 - this one is all about various use Cas is
05:59 - for a pressure washer so naturally you
06:01 - can wash things now for me I really
06:03 - enjoyed my time playing power wash
06:05 - simulator so playing something like it
06:06 - in VR sounds like it can be a very
06:09 - relaxing experience however this one
06:10 - builds upon that and includes various
06:12 - other activities as well all of them
06:14 - based on using a pressure washer so for
06:16 - example you can play football and push a
06:18 - ball around in multiplayer you can use
06:20 - the pressure washer to fly around like a
06:22 - jetpack it also allows you to easily
06:24 - import custom models and wash them
06:25 - that's a pretty awesome feature so all
06:27 - in all this looks like a really relaxing
06:29 - experience in single player or a fun
06:31 - time with friends it is out now on Early
06:32 - Access with 20 positive reviews then if
06:34 - you're looking for something spooky here
06:36 - is lethal company this is a co-op
06:38 - Scavenging horror game all about
06:40 - exploring abandon moons in order to
06:42 - gather resources to then sell and
06:44 - obviously do that without dying it's
06:46 - very much focused on Co-op you can go
06:47 - out into the world while another player
06:49 - stays in the control room monitoring
06:51 - everything do make sure to take a
06:52 - flashlight because things get dark quite
06:54 - quickly and when it gets dark you must
06:56 - hurry up and get back to the ship
06:58 - hopefully without leaving anyone behind
06:59 - then you sell the loot you acquired buy
07:01 - better equipment and tools and go out on
07:03 - riskier and more dangerous missions I
07:05 - really quite like the concept of this
07:06 - one I imagine it's a ton of fun with
07:08 - friends I'm usually not into horror
07:10 - games but I'd love to give this one a
07:11 - try the reviews certainly do seem to
07:13 - point that it's a great game it is only
07:14 - out in Early Access but already has
07:16 - 1,700 overwhelming positive views at 98%
07:20 - positive so people are really loving
07:21 - this one next if you want something more
07:23 - calm and jolly here is ubets it's a
07:25 - farming game with a really very Charming
07:27 - style there are creatures called ubet
07:29 - which you can grow train and collect
07:31 - they can also help you out on a farm so
07:33 - the game has some minor automation
07:34 - elements instead of combat you solve
07:36 - disagreements through the medium of
07:38 - dance where each ubet has a different
07:39 - unique move there are tons of things to
07:41 - do lots of mini games to play and a huge
07:43 - world to explore alongside many unique
07:45 - characters to meet you can even set up a
07:47 - store to sell your goods and follow a
07:49 - nice overarching story basically this

08:09 - difference this game really lets you

08:16 - ERS to push your goals forward and then
