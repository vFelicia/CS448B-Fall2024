00:03 - games made with unity for august 2021
00:06 - this is a particularly stacked month
00:08 - lots of huge hits and highly awaited
00:09 - games that finally released my goal with
00:11 - these videos is to highlight what can be
00:13 - done with the engine so you know really
00:14 - the only limit is just your own
00:15 - imagination all of these games are
00:17 - uniquely impressive and they showcase
00:19 - the power of the engine in tons of
00:20 - different scenarios so the list is in no
00:22 - particular order except for the number
00:24 - one game that is my personal pick of the
00:25 - month there's links in description for
00:27 - some of the games those are film playing
00:29 - so if you use them it's same price to
00:30 - you and you'll also be supporting the
00:31 - channel alright so starting off at
00:33 - number 10 with one of the biggest
00:35 - releases on steam humankind
00:37 - this one was constantly in the top 5
00:39 - most wishlisted game it's been on that
00:41 - list for ages and finally released it's
00:43 - a forex strategy game a nice competition
00:46 - to civilization as you play you rewrite
00:49 - the entire history of humankind combine
00:51 - up to 60 historical cultures as you lead
00:53 - your people from ancient age into modern
00:56 - times
00:56 - face real historical events take
00:58 - impactful moral decisions and make some
01:00 - scientific breakthroughs control your
01:02 - units and master battle in land sea and
01:05 - air so if you like 4x games then this
01:07 - seems like a great new entry in the
01:09 - genre next up another one that is also
01:11 - very highly awaited recompile i've been
01:14 - watching gifs of this game on twitter
01:15 - for what feels like years now it's
01:17 - certainly very visually striking as soon
01:19 - as you see a screenshot or a gif it's
01:21 - immediately recognizable the game is a
01:24 - metroidvania 3d platformer with a bunch
01:26 - of skills in combat the environment
01:28 - contains all kinds of logic gates you
01:30 - can freely interact with so invert them
01:32 - and hack all kinds of doors invaders and
01:34 - even enemies if you want to learn how to
01:36 - find success marketing on twitter then
01:38 - definitely check out this game's twitter
01:40 - account up next yet another one that
01:42 - people have been looking forward to for
01:44 - a long time 12 minutes
01:46 - this one has been something like over
01:47 - five years in development real long time
01:50 - it's a real-time top-down interactive
01:53 - thriller game you find yourself stuck in
01:55 - a time loop reliving the same horrible
01:57 - day over and over again
01:59 - the description doesn't really say much
02:01 - since this one is all about the mystery
02:03 - but that mystery certainly is very
02:04 - compelling
02:05 - usually i'm not really into
02:07 - point-and-clicks but this one certainly
02:08 - looks very interesting i'm a big fan of
02:10 - the time loop concept i love playing
02:12 - outer wild so i look forward to playing
02:14 - this one whenever i have the time then
02:16 - for something quite a bit more jolly
02:18 - dodgeball academia
02:20 - actually already played this one i was
02:21 - randomly browsing my xbox one day and
02:23 - this one was on game pass it's a really
02:26 - great game it's very fun dodgeball game
02:28 - with lots of interesting unique
02:29 - characters and tons of special moves
02:31 - the whole thing plays like it's a
02:33 - saturday morning cartoon show really
02:35 - very jolly very funny and the game
02:37 - itself is also pretty well designed each
02:39 - character has its own moveset and you
02:41 - can manage your team to choose which one
02:43 - to use first i really like playing it
02:45 - it's included on game pass so if you
02:47 - have that definitely give it a try by
02:49 - the way if you find the video helpful
02:50 - please hit the like button it's a tiny
02:52 - thing but really does help thanks
02:54 - another one that a lot of people have
02:56 - been looking forward to is naraka
02:58 - bladepoint
02:59 - this one had a huge beta quite a while
03:01 - ago i think it was one of the biggest
03:03 - team betas from what i can remember the
03:05 - concept is a melee combat meets battle
03:07 - royale so that certainly makes it stand
03:10 - out from all the other battle royale
03:11 - games features a very diverse skill
03:14 - system play with swords daggers bows and
03:16 - use your special abilities you've got a
03:18 - really nice grappling hook so there's
03:20 - tons of verticality to design
03:22 - it's also a very versatile tool you can
03:24 - use it to pull yourself upwards run away
03:27 - from a battle or just zip straight
03:28 - towards the end and visually it also
03:30 - looks very nice it features a more
03:32 - eastern art sound which once again makes
03:34 - it stand out from all the other modern
03:36 - military battle royal games
03:38 - for some vr here is a nice sequel i
03:41 - expect you to die too i played the first
03:43 - one quite a long time ago it's quite an
03:45 - inventive concept perfectly made for vr
03:48 - it's essentially an escape puzzle game
03:50 - very much inspired by spy movies
03:53 - you are in a small seated area with tons
03:55 - of props lying around you have to use
03:57 - your mind to solve confounding puzzles
03:59 - and travel the world to stop some world
04:00 - domination every mission is connected so
04:03 - there is a cohesive storyline
04:04 - culminating in an explosive ending your
04:06 - goal is simple it's to simply not die
04:09 - if you have vr definitely try this one
04:11 - it's very unique and the whole thing is
04:12 - meant to be a seated experience so you
04:14 - don't really need too much space then
04:16 - something very relaxing that just came
04:17 - out of early access townscaper
04:20 - when this game came out there were tons
04:21 - of gifts of it on twitter the game is
04:23 - just a joy to look at mechanically the
04:26 - game is quite simple it really is mainly
04:28 - an experience rather than a game
04:30 - it's a great example of the power of
04:32 - simple but very polished visuals coupled
04:34 - with some excellent game juice just the
04:36 - simple action of placing down a building
04:38 - feels very satisfying there's no time
04:40 - limit no goal just build for the joy of
04:43 - building very good when you want to just
04:45 - have a very relaxing time if that's too
04:48 - comfortable and you want something more
04:50 - hardcore here is grime it's a fast-paced
04:53 - unforgiving action-adventure game
04:55 - features a very interesting weapon
04:57 - system where you crush your foes with
04:58 - some living weapons that mutate both in
05:00 - form and function and of course many
05:03 - unique and dangerous bosses for you to
05:04 - battle it's got some great visuals very
05:07 - dark and moody and another one that is
05:09 - also a simple concept executed perfectly
05:12 - is the ramp it's a skateboarding game
05:14 - with no fluff so there's no unlockables
05:17 - no score no explosions you really just
05:19 - have yourself and your skateboard you do
05:21 - a bunch of tricks and just enjoy
05:23 - yourself with this satisfying
05:24 - skateboarding gameplay like the
05:26 - developer says this game slash toy
05:29 - offers you 15 minutes of flow to make a
05:30 - boring day great all of that for the
05:32 - price of a single latin and finally at
05:35 - number one for my personal pick of the
05:36 - month here is car mechanic simulator
05:38 - 2021 it's exactly what you expect it's a
05:42 - simulated game where you're a mechanic
05:43 - working on cars
05:45 - there's quite a lot of these games
05:46 - usually one every year i think the last
05:48 - one i played i believe was in 2016
05:51 - based on the reviews and the very very
05:52 - positive reception this one got it seems
05:55 - like it's the best one yet so i
05:56 - definitely want to give it a try like i
05:58 - said the name is very descriptive you
06:00 - get a car find out what's wrong with it
06:02 - you have to deal with a bunch of screws
06:03 - take out various pieces to get to the
06:05 - part that is broken then you replace it
06:07 - put it all back together again and make
06:09 - a buck there's over 4 000 unique parts
06:12 - and over 70 cars tons of content you can
06:15 - also expand your garage to provide some
06:17 - more services do some painting and some
06:19 - tuning pay a visit to the auction house
06:21 - and buy some hidden gems that look rough
06:23 - and make them really shiny
06:25 - i remember playing a game called
06:26 - gearhead garage when i was a kid i think
06:28 - i just had the demo but i played a ton
06:31 - so this genre of taking things apart and
06:33 - building them back together definitely
06:34 - appeals to me some of these simulator
06:36 - games tend to be quite janky but this
06:38 - one does have over 5000 very positive
06:40 - reviews so it seems to be well made
06:43 - if you like this genre of taking things
06:45 - apart and putting them back together
06:46 - then this seems like an excellent new
06:48 - entry alright so that's 10 awesome new
06:51 - games made with unity launched in august
06:53 - 2021
