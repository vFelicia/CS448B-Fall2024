00:13 - list of free assets and in the next ones
00:15 - i won't be covering paid assets and
00:16 - tools check out the phone playlist to
00:18 - see all the highlights every month you
00:20 - might find something that would be just
00:21 - perfect for whatever project you're
00:23 - currently working on let me know in the
00:25 - comments if you pick up any of these and
00:26 - what you intend to do with them
00:28 - and by the way right now there's a mega
00:30 - bundle happening it's a massive discount
00:32 - at 95 percent off it's pretty nice in
00:34 - terms of variety lots of systems props
00:36 - particles and sounds these bundles are
00:38 - always great value if just one of these
00:40 - assets interests you then the home
00:41 - bundle is worth it check the link in the
00:42 - description to see it and by the way
00:44 - check out my own assets on the store so
00:46 - far i've made the free key door system
00:48 - which is a super simple way to add keys
00:50 - and doors to your games and the mouse
00:52 - cursor system pro which is a very easy
00:54 - to use tool to help you create custom
00:56 - animated cursors to really make your
00:57 - game stand out
00:59 - i'm currently working on converting more
01:00 - videos into pro systems so stay tuned
01:02 - for that
01:03 - alright so starting off with a really
01:05 - nice low poly fps pack this one is
01:07 - pretty great it's got tons of variety
01:09 - for a free pack
01:10 - you've got a total of 10 weapons
01:13 - shotguns pistols smgs sniper rifles and
01:15 - more as well as a bunch of throwables
01:17 - like a flashbang and a frag grenade
01:20 - every gun also has a bunch of animations
01:22 - for shooting reloading idle draw and so
01:24 - on i have to say this free pack is
01:27 - really very impressive so if you have
01:28 - any idea that requires some low quality
01:31 - weapons then go ahead and get this one
01:33 - then for a cool effect here is a cube
01:35 - map blur it's pretty simple does exactly
01:38 - what it says so you can use this for
01:40 - example to power your sky boxes in order
01:42 - to highlight whatever object is in front
01:44 - of the screen next up if you need some
01:46 - ui check out this dark theme pack it's
01:49 - got quite a lot of unique elements so
01:51 - some basic buttons and a whole bunch of
01:53 - icons all of them really nice really
01:55 - clean designs they would look great on
01:57 - pretty much any game
01:59 - if you need some more low poly assets
02:00 - here's actually two packs in one there's
02:03 - the low poly swords pack and the rpg
02:05 - weapons pack there's quite a lot of
02:07 - variety here on the swords back you have
02:09 - a total of 15 unique swords some of them
02:12 - look pretty simple and others look quite
02:14 - unique and on the other pack you've got
02:16 - a bunch more rpg weapon types so axes
02:19 - staffs bows shields and so on with these
02:21 - two packs and some low-poly characters
02:23 - you can already build tons of unique
02:25 - medieval or fantasy games then for an
02:27 - interesting tool here is desktop
02:29 - streamer it does exactly what it says it
02:32 - streams your whole desktop to another
02:34 - machine
02:35 - so it's definitely a very niche thing
02:37 - but if you want to work on your project
02:38 - while using another machine that might
02:40 - be very useful
02:41 - next if you're working on a racing game
02:43 - here is a stylized car a really nice and
02:46 - simple design comes with a bunch of
02:48 - color variations so very simple and
02:51 - perfect for your next racing prototype
02:53 - maybe you need some buttons to make your
02:55 - game playable with touch then check out
02:57 - this virtual buttons asset
02:59 - features some simple buttons some d-pads
03:01 - and joysticks
03:03 - i recently covered the new input system
03:05 - which has support for very easily adding
03:07 - some on-screen touch controls so you
03:09 - could combine that with these visuals
03:11 - and easily make your game play one with
03:13 - touch
03:14 - for some sound effects here is the
03:16 - fantasy stinger sfx pack
03:18 - features 40 interesting sounds some of
03:21 - them are very mysterious others very
03:23 - gentle others very scary
03:25 - so put a bunch of these when some events
03:27 - happen in your fantasy game and really
03:29 - make it stand out
03:30 - next up a potentially very interesting
03:32 - tool it's the serialized interfaces
03:34 - package
03:36 - you can serialize interfaces and drag
03:38 - their references in the editor
03:40 - so you can define the exact interface
03:42 - type instead of making it just a game
03:44 - object reference and trying to get that
03:46 - interface
03:47 - then using the finder it will allow you
03:49 - to drag things that actually implement
03:51 - that interface
03:52 - so interfaces are always a great tool so
03:54 - maybe get this one and see if it helps
03:56 - you write better cleaner code
03:58 - and finally here is a really cool
04:00 - stylized pirate ship
04:02 - maybe you've got a pirate game idea
04:03 - you've been thinking about if so this is
04:05 - a great starting point it's a stylized
04:08 - asset but it's also pretty detailed so
04:10 - you could use this to make a top-down
04:12 - game something like sid meier's pirates
04:15 - or maybe something in first or third
04:16 - person something like sea of thieves
04:18 - really good looking asset and very
04:20 - versatile alright so those are my top 10
04:23 - free new assets on the unity asset store
04:25 - for july 2021 there's links to all in
04:28 - the description stay tuned for the next
