00:00 - in this video we're going to view the
00:01 - best eternals of the past year and look
00:03 - ahead into the future there were 200
00:06 - videos covering all sorts of topics from
00:08 - simple mechanics UI elements ECS
00:10 - tutorials and many more still to come
00:12 - let's begin
00:15 - [Music]
00:20 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:22 - and this channel is all about helping
00:23 - you learn how to make your own games
00:25 - with nf2 torrents made by a professional
00:27 - indie game developer so if you find the
00:29 - video helpful consider subscribing so
00:31 - here we are in May 2019 the channel
00:34 - officially had its first video in May
00:36 - 13th 2018 and that really feels like a
00:39 - very long time ago since then there have
00:41 - been 200 videos covering all sorts of
00:43 - topics to help you make your own games
00:45 - all of them in the foremost step-by-step
00:48 - tutorial so you can follow along as well
00:50 - as project files and utilities that you
00:52 - can download for free essentially what
00:54 - I'm making in this channel is what I
00:55 - wish I had a veil upon when I got
00:57 - started I feel watching a step-by-step
00:59 - tutorial and downloading the final
01:01 - project files to read through the code
01:02 - is one of the best ways that you can
01:04 - learn the first video was covering a
01:07 - health system looking back at it I was
01:09 - certainly a lot more inexperienced at
01:11 - making videos over time I feel life
01:13 - significantly improved my presentation
01:15 - skills and got better at simplifying the
01:17 - setup I believe the videos are now much
01:19 - easier to follow and learn from back
01:21 - when I started the channel it was
01:23 - something I was very excited about but
01:25 - wasn't sure if it would work when making
01:27 - my own games it's always tough to stay
01:29 - working on the same project for months
01:30 - and months usually my games take around
01:32 - one year to make which is a very long
01:34 - time to stay working on just one thing I
01:36 - truly love programming and I love
01:38 - experimenting so this channel was kind
01:41 - of an attempt to be able to work on
01:42 - small projects and making cool mechanics
01:44 - whilst being able to teach people what I
01:46 - know thankfully the response has been
01:48 - great so far with plenty of comments
01:50 - mentioning how a video helped them get
01:51 - started or finally understand a complex
01:53 - topic like for example unity ecs so many
01:57 - thanks to you for watching the videos
01:58 - and I hope you've learned a lot from
02:00 - them in total there have been 200 videos
02:03 - so far covering a wide range of topics
02:05 - lots of great UI elements covering
02:09 - mini-map quest pointer portrait window
02:12 - and several bars these are always fun to
02:14 - make and relatively easy to add to a
02:16 - different project pretty much every game
02:19 - will have UI ailments so knowing how to
02:21 - build anything is hugely helpful
02:25 - ECS in the home dot stack is a very
02:27 - recent topic that I'm covering and I'm
02:29 - loving it so far the attack is still in
02:31 - preview but I will like this feature
02:33 - approach for unity it provides excellent
02:35 - performance and a really interesting way
02:37 - of thinking about problems at the same
02:40 - time it's not the only way it's just
02:41 - another tool in your game to have
02:43 - toolkit so a really good skill to
02:45 - develop is knowing when to use game
02:47 - objects and when to use ECS so
02:49 - definitely look forward to more ECS
02:51 - tutorials a game is just a group of
02:54 - several systems working together to
02:55 - create a specific experience game
02:58 - development involves making cool
02:59 - mechanics but also making sure it's
03:01 - enjoyable to work with those mechanics
03:03 - so that means you need to handle saving
03:05 - and loading scene management how to play
03:07 - sounds and so on a lot of what goes on
03:09 - behind the game are things you might
03:11 - never think about it as a player but you
03:13 - quickly realize how essential they are
03:15 - as soon as you start making your own
03:16 - games game elements are what makes and
03:19 - defines your player experience so how
03:22 - does the player move in your game how
03:24 - does he attack what happens when enemies
03:26 - get hit when the enemies get spawned and
03:28 - so on this defines what type of game
03:31 - you're really making and just how good
03:32 - it feels to play the experience should
03:34 - be compelling is it control and very
03:36 - satisfying it's better to have fewer
03:39 - excellent helmets than too many that
03:41 - don't really work together characters
03:44 - are always fun to make it's always an
03:46 - interesting challenge to take a
03:47 - character and we make it specifically in
03:49 - my case to work in 2d for example in the
03:51 - Captain America video it caused me to
03:53 - think how to translate the shield into a
03:55 - game mechanic so how far it should go
03:57 - how much damage how does it get back and
03:59 - so on then once the design is settled
04:02 - thinking about how to set that up in
04:04 - unity how is the code organized what
04:06 - causes are needed and so on so these
04:08 - videos to me are a great way of doing a
04:10 - sort of mini game jam where you start to
04:12 - the character and try to make it work in
04:14 - a game give it a try for yourself think
04:16 - of a character you like and design of
04:18 - mechanics to make it work as a game
04:20 - another great topic is recreating
04:23 - popular game elements pretty much
04:25 - everyone who wants to make games also
04:27 - plays games so being able to look at
04:29 - professional games you play and figuring
04:31 - out how they work is a great way to
04:33 - learn every time I play a game there's
04:35 - always a part of my brain that is
04:36 - in the game design and how all the
04:38 - systems work together if you want to get
04:41 - better as the game developer start being
04:42 - very active when playing games think
04:45 - about why they built a certain system
04:47 - what purpose is served what are the
04:49 - individual elements that make it up
04:50 - how could you recreate the unity for
04:53 - example do you need to make shader or
04:54 - create a class to handle some specific
04:56 - area these questions are a great way to
04:59 - grow as a game developer and learning
05:01 - how to build pretty much anything the
05:03 - game mom currently working on is been
05:05 - around Tycoon which is currently on
05:06 - early access so there have been several
05:08 - videos covering systems from it one of
05:11 - the reasons I started this channel was
05:12 - because I want to make tutorials that
05:14 - have an actual real practical
05:15 - application instead of just generic
05:17 - theory so I think having videos where I
05:20 - go through the code that is being used
05:22 - in a real game is extremely valid I've
05:24 - covered several systems already so you
05:26 - can pick up the game and play for
05:27 - yourself to see the final systems then
05:30 - watch the videos to see how they
05:31 - actually work so that's 200 videos
05:34 - covering all kinds of topics my goal is
05:36 - to get to a point that when someone
05:38 - asked me a question like how do you make
05:39 - a high score table or how do you make a
05:41 - mini map I can simply point them to a
05:43 - detailed tutorial video the future is
05:46 - also looking very exciting just recently
05:49 - I started working with ECS and so far
05:51 - I'm loving how it works I really like
05:53 - how it forces you to think about how
05:55 - you're going to set up your code and
05:57 - obviously the massive benefits it
05:58 - provides since the games that I most
06:01 - like to do are based on having many
06:02 - units
06:03 - ECS truly is an amazing technology so
06:05 - look for two very awesome videos in the
06:07 - coming future we're also very close to
06:10 - 50,000 subscribers so many thanks to all
06:12 - of you and I'm really glad you're
06:14 - enjoying the videos now my question to
06:16 - you is what do you want to see more of
06:18 - in the coming year what topics do you
06:20 - want to see covered maybe some Q&A or
06:22 - maybe more general advice videos let me
06:24 - know in the comments and again as a
06:26 - reminder if you like the videos you can
06:28 - support the channel and get some cool
06:30 - games for yourself by picking up the
06:31 - game bundle from the website the channel
06:34 - isn't really sustainable yet but with
06:36 - your help it won't be soon so again many
06:38 - thanks for watching the videos and I
06:40 - hope you've learned a lot from them
06:41 - alright see you next time
