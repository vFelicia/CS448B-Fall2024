03:40 - foreign
03:59 - hey everyone how's it going
04:02 - is everything okay all right thank you
04:04 - for joining me that's nice
04:07 - okay
04:08 - it seems good
04:11 - all right
04:15 - all right so hey everyone thank you for
04:16 - being here on this random Wednesday
04:18 - that's the day yeah that's nice say
04:22 - what's ugc that's user uh user generated
04:26 - content which is unity's latest tool
04:28 - which I've been researching so over here
04:30 - the plan for this live stream is
04:31 - basically
04:32 - add a bunch of modding see how the tone
04:34 - works so it should be interesting
04:36 - basically I was going to research this
04:38 - by my own but then I figured well if I'm
04:40 - going to do it why not doing touring in
04:42 - live stream so let's see it
04:45 - all right okay so basically I want to do
04:47 - a bit of work so hopefully this will be
04:49 - interesting entertaining educational I'm
04:51 - not sure but hopefully you'll enjoy it
04:53 - okay all right so
04:56 - and feel free to ask any questions and
04:59 - I'll try to answer whilst trying to work
05:01 - at the same time that's always the big
05:03 - challenge but okay
05:04 - Chad monkey yeah sure thank you I take
05:07 - that as a compliment so yeah uh all
05:10 - right okay how does it work the modding
05:12 - well that's what I'm going to build
05:13 - right now so basically over here I've
05:15 - got my game kitchen chaos so that's a
05:17 - game that I built during the free course
05:19 - and basically with this I'm going to be
05:21 - working on how to add uh user generated
05:24 - recipes and things like that so it
05:26 - should be interesting would be user
05:28 - generated code uh for this one I'm just
05:30 - going to make it assets so just database
05:32 - so no code but technically the tool I
05:35 - think does support code and actually one
05:37 - interesting thing that I've been wanting
05:38 - to research for quite some time but so I
05:40 - haven't done it is Lua so that is
05:42 - supposedly a really nice scripting
05:44 - language that a lot of mods use so that
05:45 - is that's one of those things that I've
05:47 - had on my deal list to research for
05:49 - quite a while but still haven't
05:51 - been able to find it but yeah that
05:52 - should be interesting all right okay so
05:54 - let me get started trying to build it
05:57 - okay so first thing that I want to do
06:00 - is the game has a bunch of fixed uh
06:04 - yellow moon Roblox yeah Roblox use logo
06:06 - quite a lot yeah uh yeah so the first
06:08 - thing that I want to do is to be able to
06:09 - create some Dynamic kitchen object
06:11 - because right now all of these these are
06:14 - all fixed so these are all over here on
06:15 - edit time so I want to be able to edit
06:17 - one in runtime so that essentially means
06:20 - that I've got to instantiate one of
06:22 - these script mode objects in runtime
06:24 - then assign all these films and
06:25 - something like that okay all right so
06:27 - that sounds like a good start so let's
06:28 - begin let's create an easy sharp script
06:30 - for the kitchen game ugc something like
06:34 - this
06:35 - like Enough Five Nights at Freddy's for
06:37 - me horror is one of those things that I
06:39 - just can't handle so for me uh that
06:43 - actually kind of sucks seeing so many
06:44 - people praise things like Resident Evil
06:46 - and something like that but for me
06:47 - horror I really can't handle it so yeah
06:50 - I wish I could enjoy the things that
06:52 - those people enjoy but yeah I really I
06:55 - really can't hard is way too much for me
06:58 - where'd you learn all this coding Thing
07:00 - One by writing tons and tons of code
07:02 - over the past it's almost been 25 years
07:05 - so yeah if you write tons and tons of
07:08 - tons and tons of code over time you will
07:11 - learn and everything becomes much much
07:12 - easier so yeah experience strongly is
07:15 - the most important thing all right okay
07:17 - so on this one first thing that I want
07:20 - to do is I need to instantiate the new
07:22 - kitchen object uh
07:25 - and for that I think it's through
07:27 - scribble object create an instance okay
07:29 - let's create an instance of type kitchen
07:32 - objective so all right so this is going
07:34 - to give me a new kitchen object as so
07:36 - okay
07:38 - so then I just need to assign everything
07:40 - so I need to assign a name let's say
07:43 - test
07:44 - then I'm going to need to assign yeah
07:46 - that's the thing I need the prefab so
07:48 - this is the part that is going to be
07:49 - quite tricky and then I need a Sprite
07:51 - but for now let's just find something up
07:54 - here
07:55 - so gestationalize field
07:57 - for a uh debug prefab
08:02 - and then one for the Sprite just a
08:04 - Sprites
08:06 - okay
08:07 - stream Avatar is hotbound well if you
08:10 - want you can actually customize your own
08:12 - avatar so if you want to
08:15 - if you want you can draw and you can
08:17 - come up with your own thing just if you
08:19 - do it just let me know there's a nice
08:21 - guide over here on the website so you
08:23 - can customize you can do some basic
08:24 - customization or you can actually draw
08:26 - on top and do a bunch of things and draw
08:29 - just about anything so that should be
08:30 - fun and if you're curious as to how this
08:32 - whole thing works I've actually got
08:34 - links to various tutorials that I
08:36 - covered over here so if you want to see
08:38 - that yep
08:39 - how do you duplicate the lights fast
08:40 - what is the hotkey for it's literally
08:42 - just Ctrl C Ctrl V just select the line
08:44 - just like this so instead of selecting
08:46 - something just sound like this Ctrl C
08:48 - Ctrl V and just duplicate the line and
08:50 - then another one that is super useful is
08:52 - Ctrl X to cut an entire line so just
08:55 - those two shortcuts are super useful uh
08:58 - all right so over here I'm going to be
08:59 - using a debug prefab and a Sprite okay
09:02 - so now let's go back into Unity
09:06 - and over here I'm going to need to
09:08 - assign so the debug prefab now for that
09:11 - I'm going to need to something
09:14 - so you've been coding for 25 years can't
09:16 - even confirm that yep I mean I started
09:18 - when I was 10 years old by making RC
09:21 - scripts and now I'm almost 35 so yeah
09:24 - it's been 25 years quite a long time
09:27 - uh all right so first thing I need is a
09:30 - prefab so let me just drag this random
09:32 - cue make it into a prefab
09:35 - okay
09:38 - all right
09:42 - so there's no yeah that's that's all I
09:44 - need so just drag the cube prefab and
09:46 - the Sprite and let me choose something
09:48 - random let's say the warning Sprite
09:50 - okay so that pretty much creates a
09:52 - kitchen object dynamically
09:54 - uh then for yeah for testing for picking
09:58 - it up let me just make a nice container
10:00 - so let me select
10:02 - certain years old yeah I mean I started
10:04 - making super basic things so don't be
10:07 - confused on you know when I was 10 years
10:09 - old I wasn't doing the things that I'm
10:10 - doing nowadays so yeah I did start that
10:14 - age but definitely with a completely
10:15 - different skill set everything starts
10:18 - off much easier but yeah
10:21 - for the cgc that's user generated
10:23 - content okay so I need the container and
10:25 - basically on this container I need to
10:26 - assign my generated kitchen object the
10:28 - cell so that I can pick it up so that
10:30 - should be fun so up here let me just add
10:33 - a reference for the oh not caps
10:35 - container counter
10:38 - let's add this one
10:41 - then over here let me just drag the
10:43 - reference
10:45 - yes code instead of Visual Studio yeah I
10:47 - did use it when I made the turn-based
10:49 - strategy course I was indeed using vs
10:51 - code instead of visual studio and I
10:53 - don't know I prefer visual studio just
10:55 - seems honestly for no specific reason
10:57 - they are like 99 the same given the kind
11:00 - of things that I do with them so either
11:02 - one works but yeah I'm so used to visual
11:04 - studio there's really no need to do
11:06 - something different it works works
11:09 - perfectly fine does everything that I
11:10 - want it looks is only the same so yeah
11:13 - pretty much just stick with it
11:15 - but about starting a game company now
11:18 - really I mean my skill set is more
11:19 - learning things by myself and working by
11:21 - myself so the idea of managing a company
11:24 - managing a bunch of people that really
11:26 - does not does not appeal to me so so
11:29 - yeah for me it's uh I'm very happy
11:31 - making games pretty much just by myself
11:35 - just doing a car crap that's not it so
11:38 - yeah for me I really just prefer working
11:40 - by myself doing my things yeah
11:43 - I'm not opposed to working with others
11:44 - just I'm definitely not good at managing
11:47 - people so
11:48 - yeah that is something that would not
11:51 - suit me okay so set the kitchen object
11:53 - to so when we receive a kitchen object
11:56 - that so
11:57 - and then over here just set it
12:00 - so then on this one it's not set kitchen
12:02 - object but the kitchen object is so okay
12:04 - so I just need to set it and now the
12:06 - player should actually be able to
12:08 - interact with this generated kitchen
12:10 - object or so should be nice
12:13 - a game like TFT is that in fightatics
12:16 - yeah that should be fun that would be
12:17 - that was an interesting genre the uh
12:20 - what is called Auto Battlers yeah those
12:23 - were
12:24 - that was a fun genre it came in it
12:25 - suddenly exploded but then didn't really
12:27 - build into too much that is when I'm
12:29 - sure that I've wanted to explore for
12:31 - quite a bit uh okay so let me just test
12:35 - what do you mean by modding I mean
12:37 - adding things after the game is done so
12:40 - pretty much over here I'm trying to add
12:41 - some recipes and nope got an error okay
12:44 - what is the error what is no
12:46 - uh oh right it doesn't have it needs to
12:49 - have a kitchen object okay
12:52 - so once I do this yeah it's on the debug
12:55 - prefab
12:57 - so let me get a transform for the prefab
13:00 - and I'm going to instantiate just so
13:02 - that I make a copy of this one
13:04 - so I instantiate that one I use this one
13:07 - as the bug prefab
13:09 - and then on this prefab I need to that's
13:11 - not the one on this Prefab game object
13:13 - add component of type kitchen object and
13:17 - on the kitchen object I need to set the
13:19 - kitchen object as so
13:22 - I think that's all it takes so let's see
13:24 - right I need to implement this so let's
13:27 - see
13:28 - ugc is this gonna be a video yep I'm
13:30 - pretty much just doing researching right
13:33 - now but yep that is the goal to make it
13:35 - a video the tool is currently in open
13:37 - Alpha so uh let me just write this just
13:41 - this is second
13:44 - uh just
13:46 - Unity ugc because they've already
13:48 - announced the tool
13:51 - um yep there you go if you want another
13:52 - tool it is currently in open now for
13:55 - open Beta open Beta there it is so yeah
13:57 - if you want to start looking into it
14:00 - yeah that's pretty much the tone that
14:01 - I'm trying to
14:02 - research right now
14:05 - I'll try making your own custom game
14:06 - engine no that is making a game engine
14:10 - it sounds fun it is one thing that I
14:11 - would love to be able to do at some
14:13 - point but yeah making a game engine is
14:16 - really just a it's an extremely complex
14:18 - thing building everything from scratch
14:19 - so yeah usually the advice is either you
14:22 - want to make a game or you want to make
14:24 - a game engine you can't really do both
14:25 - so you gotta pick one or the other so
14:28 - I'd love to research it at one point
14:30 - just learn how to work with opengl or
14:32 - DirectX learning how to work it really
14:35 - close to the metal that should be would
14:37 - be a fun thing so if I could find time I
14:39 - would love to research that but yeah
14:42 - pretty much if you want to make aim then
14:44 - just use a game engine whatever game
14:46 - engine takes yeah
14:48 - uh okay so set kitchen object over here
14:51 - I'm going to set it and set it to you
14:53 - this kitchen object or so okay so like
14:55 - this the player should be able to pick
14:57 - up that one so let's see if it does work
15:01 - any reason why
15:03 - the reason why you didn't use a capsule
15:05 - Collider doing physical cast seems a bit
15:07 - hard uh there's always many many ways to
15:10 - solve any problem and for that that is
15:13 - actually a very common question I've got
15:16 - that question plenty of time so over
15:17 - here on the course website there's some
15:19 - kind of FAQ so that one's on the
15:21 - character controller so over here yep
15:24 - the question so why move a transform to
15:26 - a capsule cast instead of rigid body in
15:27 - the calendar and the answer is there are
15:29 - many many options so you could
15:30 - definitely use that if you wanted
15:33 - that is one found option and in this
15:37 - case I just did it just to avoid using
15:38 - rigid bodies because the entire goal for
15:40 - this course was to prepare for the
15:41 - second course which is on making in
15:43 - multiplayer and multiplayer you should
15:45 - really avoid using rigid bodies whenever
15:46 - possible so that's the main reason why
15:48 - why I chose to go with a capsule cast
15:51 - pretty much is handling it manually
15:52 - instead of using a rigid body but yeah
15:54 - using a ridge body in the calendar that
15:56 - works just fine so if you want
15:58 - definitely do that any new channel
16:00 - members hey thank you
16:02 - right thanks for becoming a member
16:04 - that's nice thank you
16:06 - okay
16:08 - uh what was I doing
16:11 - um
16:13 - uh oh right I was trying to see if this
16:15 - works and if they're going with that
16:18 - I've got a custom kitchen object it's
16:20 - just a cube but technically it is a
16:22 - kitchen object can I even deliver this
16:24 - or well I guess not because it's not on
16:26 - a plate can I add it onto a plate that's
16:28 - a good question
16:30 - can I go nope all right so I need to add
16:32 - it onto all right great so but just like
16:34 - this I am indeed uh creating some
16:37 - Dynamic objects in runtime okay so
16:39 - that's great all right
16:42 - boy so many questions sorry I'm trying
16:44 - to keep up trying to work and answer
16:46 - questions at the same time yeah
16:48 - make time increase with delivery yep
16:50 - that would be if you wanted to make this
16:52 - game a bit more challenging a bit more
16:54 - score based then yep that would be one
16:56 - excellent uh Improvement
16:59 - internship being a character Bill using
17:01 - one shapes oh that's interesting one
17:02 - shape is actually something that I
17:03 - haven't used too much there's not that
17:06 - many uh asset packs that have it uh yeah
17:09 - they are really interesting it's a
17:11 - really great way of adding customization
17:13 - although yeah my question is how do you
17:16 - actually do that as a 3D modeler do you
17:18 - have to yeah I assume you have to
17:20 - position all the bones and then say
17:21 - modifying this slider modifies this bone
17:23 - this Direction that's a it's an
17:24 - interesting topic definitely something
17:26 - that I would love to
17:27 - research okay so yeah
17:30 - do you think it's best to start as a
17:32 - beginner well I mean this is a Unity
17:33 - channel so I'm going to say Unity but
17:35 - I'm also going to say any engine is
17:37 - great nowadays really as game developers
17:39 - we are supporting for choice if you
17:41 - choose Unity or unreal organelle there's
17:43 - pretty much no wrong answer so whatever
17:45 - you do just pick something and yeah pick
17:49 - something and start learning that's much
17:50 - more important than actually trying to
17:53 - pick the perfect thing and being stuck
17:55 - forever so just pick something and start
17:57 - learning
17:58 - bones and lender first and rigged up in
18:00 - unity oh that's interesting yeah I
18:02 - wonder how that process works because
18:04 - yeah blend shapes they are indeed quite
18:06 - interesting but not many asset packs
18:07 - seem to have them so well actually
18:09 - usually I stick with low poly acid so
18:11 - maybe that's why I think more realistic
18:13 - hard selling benefits quite a bit more
18:15 - from blend shape so maybe those do tend
18:18 - to have them uh okay just over here just
18:20 - a quick one on the game object let me
18:22 - set active and do false
18:25 - except officially a good question how do
18:28 - I spawn a prefab
18:29 - but then
18:31 - can I disable it from the scene
18:35 - because I think this is actually going
18:37 - to
18:38 - so remember try creating a prefab for
18:43 - something
18:45 - hmm
18:47 - if I go in there pick it up yeah there
18:49 - you go he did pick it up but it is
18:51 - invisible all right so this is a bit
18:53 - annoying spawning the prefab but well I
18:55 - guess I can just set the prefab dot
18:58 - position equals new Vector three let's
19:00 - put it on a thousand zero zero just so
19:02 - that it doesn't show up over there in
19:04 - the middle
19:05 - with your YouTube video that's nice
19:06 - thank you
19:08 - who is not using dark mode yeah for me
19:10 - dark mode really destroys my eyes so
19:12 - yeah that is definitely not something
19:14 - that I can use all right awesome so here
19:16 - I am moving around a random ingredient
19:18 - which is just a cube but yep that does
19:20 - work
19:21 - okay all right great
19:24 - considered to be the most successful in
19:26 - the dev on YouTube I mean that really
19:28 - depends on what you
19:30 - what Niche you're talking about I mean
19:32 - in terms of uh devlogs there are so many
19:35 - channels so much bigger than me the
19:37 - obvious question is Danny so yeah
19:40 - but yeah honestly the main thing is
19:43 - there's there's so much content so many
19:45 - awesome things
19:47 - so if you go
19:49 - to ah corrupt this is the the issue so
19:53 - search for example tardev has a great
19:57 - Channel a bunch of tutorials all of them
20:00 - really nice this one runs sine waves
20:01 - this one is really cool then samyam also
20:04 - has some great ones I was looking at a
20:06 - bunch of our unit uh input System videos
20:10 - so yeah tons of awesome stuff yeah
20:14 - so yeah if you want to learn uh uh Game
20:18 - Dev on YouTube then yeah thankfully
20:20 - nowadays there are tons and tons of
20:21 - options basically when I got started
20:23 - there was no such thing so yeah if I was
20:26 - starting today things would be quite a
20:27 - bit easier which would be fun so yeah
20:28 - it's always right uh okay great so let
20:31 - me just think notification remember yeah
20:33 - it's not broken just manual so once
20:36 - again thanks so much Eliana thank you
20:37 - for becoming a channel member that's
20:39 - nice
20:40 - um
20:41 - okay let me think what do I want to do
20:44 - I would want to make uh some kind of
20:47 - recipe and then I'll worry about
20:49 - uploading it to ugc and downloading and
20:51 - so on uh okay so for now let me make a
20:55 - custom Dynamic recipe so in order to be
20:57 - able to do that first I need to actually
20:59 - be able to add it to the plate and in
21:01 - order to be able to add ingredients onto
21:03 - the plate
21:05 - I need to uh what do I do that's a good
21:09 - question is it on the plate prefound
21:11 - on the plate prefab yep it does have a
21:15 - valid kitchen object and some list uh
21:17 - okay so let me
21:19 - uh where's the
21:21 - oh do I need a reference to the
21:24 - prefab itself right because this is
21:27 - spawning oh that's actually a good
21:29 - question I'm trying to think that's the
21:31 - prefab update
21:33 - well I guess it doesn't matter because
21:34 - it happens in the beginning anyways uh
21:36 - right so
21:38 - I need a plate kitchen object prefab so
21:41 - let me go into my
21:42 - ugc script and over here let me add a
21:46 - Plate Kitchen object for the play
21:49 - kitchen object prefab
21:52 - so I'm going to take that one and pretty
21:56 - much on the valid yeah right I need to
21:58 - access it so let me go into this one
22:00 - this one has a valent kitchen object
22:02 - list okay
22:04 - so totally void add kitchen object so to
22:08 - the list
22:10 - and going to receive a kitchen object as
22:13 - soon
22:14 - and on the Valley Kitchen I'll do this
22:15 - on the list let's add this one so then
22:18 - on this one let me add kitchen object
22:21 - and so this kitchen object so and just
22:23 - with this hopefully I should be able to
22:24 - add my Dynamic object onto that one so
22:27 - that should be fun
22:29 - would you start making games with well
22:30 - at first Army game just with text-based
22:33 - things so just modding Merck and doing a
22:36 - bunch of IRC scripts and I forgot the
22:38 - reference of course uh but then
22:40 - afterwards I spent quite a bunch of time
22:42 - making Flash games so that was really
22:44 - awesome flash really was an amazing
22:46 - thing it's such a shame that it died but
22:49 - yeah for me flash really helped me in
22:51 - the about five years that I was working
22:52 - on flash I managed to create about 40
22:54 - games on all kinds of genres and that
22:57 - really helped me on my own learning
22:59 - process so that was really great for me
23:02 - learning how to do this thing hey there
23:04 - you go it works
23:06 - oh crap that's the issue the visual yeah
23:09 - it does show up the icon but it doesn't
23:12 - oh okay hmm
23:15 - and be tricky but you make chat able to
23:17 - interact with the live stream that is
23:18 - using the uni uh the Youtube API so
23:21 - actually we've got a bunch of tutorials
23:24 - on the where here it is
23:26 - this is where you can customize your
23:28 - live stream character and down here at
23:29 - the bottom it is talking about how I use
23:31 - this so first the main thing is really
23:33 - the HTTP request in order to interact
23:36 - with the YouTube API and with that yep
23:38 - you can do all kinds of things uh okay
23:41 - so here
23:43 - right that's actually one issue that I
23:45 - wasn't thinking about
23:46 - yeah because the way that I handled the
23:48 - plate that one
23:51 - hmm
23:55 - okay
23:59 - I guess I need to add the visual onto
24:01 - the
24:02 - all right yeah that's gonna be tricky
24:04 - but anyways for now let me just try to
24:06 - get the liver down that one failed okay
24:08 - so let me but anyways now I can add it
24:11 - on to that one and now let's go into
24:13 - that one teach about game marketing well
24:15 - I made a phone video on that so if you
24:18 - want
24:18 - I highly encourage well there's a bunch
24:22 - of videos but the main one is the uh
24:26 - it's actually not here it's important
24:28 - most important thing yeah if you want to
24:31 - learn about marketing which is extremely
24:32 - important definitely go ahead and dot
24:34 - yeah
24:38 - uh
24:41 - uh right
24:44 - okay so let me just okay so like this I
24:47 - can I can generate a a new kitchen
24:51 - object and runtime so that's great
24:53 - then I can add to a kitchen counter and
24:55 - I can do all kinds of things okay so
24:57 - that's good I can add them to a plate so
24:58 - the next thing is really just creating a
25:00 - recipe and being able to generate that
25:02 - recipe
25:03 - okay
25:05 - multiplayer game with reconnect feature
25:06 - uh that's
25:08 - depends on what you mean by that I'm
25:10 - guessing you mean actually changing hose
25:13 - which is quite difficult whereas
25:14 - reconnect that is actually quite simple
25:16 - you just literally connect again and
25:17 - everything will connect
25:20 - if you show the C sharp essential for
25:22 - splitting up code things uh learning how
25:25 - to use interfaces generics but yeah
25:29 - there's no
25:31 - there's no one single c-sharp thing it's
25:33 - more about how you use all the tools at
25:35 - your disposal that is the main thing you
25:38 - know
25:40 - uh uh okay so let me do that let me
25:43 - create a new recipe so let me remember
25:45 - which one was my thing so the recipe so
25:49 - okay so I need to create the recipe so
25:51 - and I need to add it onto the list and
25:53 - just with that it should spawn so let me
25:55 - add a reference for the recipe and
25:58 - listen Okay for the recipe list so if
26:02 - you need a reference to that
26:04 - and then I'm going to need to create
26:06 - so let me just go into scriptable object
26:09 - create an instance of type recipe so
26:12 - okay so this is my new recipe so recipe
26:15 - so
26:17 - and on this recipe I said what do I have
26:19 - it's just a list of kitchen objects
26:21 - so for the recipe name my recipe
26:25 - and for the recipe so for the kitchen
26:27 - object list let me just
26:30 - oh excellent that's a good question is
26:31 - this going to throw in there I'm
26:33 - actually not sure do I need to
26:34 - initialize it we shall see I guess okay
26:37 - so that it's a recipe so then the
26:40 - recipient list so let me just add uh
26:44 - yeah that one doesn't have it it has a
26:46 - recipe as simple list let me add this
26:48 - recipe okay great so that should
26:51 - actually do it
26:53 - uh all right that should be fun made
26:56 - your website yep I made it myself which
26:58 - isn't yeah it's uh that is why it
27:01 - doesn't look perfect because I'm
27:03 - definitely not a great web developer but
27:04 - it is functional so
27:07 - so yeah police status functions so
27:10 - that's good uh but yeah
27:12 - uh okay got an error because obviously I
27:16 - forgot to drag a reference it's always
27:18 - the same thing let's see all right
27:23 - PHP yep it is in PHP that is I'm not
27:27 - familiar with all the various JavaScript
27:30 - libraries so for me I just stick with
27:31 - basic PhD okay so this is the error so
27:34 - apparently I do need to initialize it
27:36 - so and you list and inside let me put
27:39 - the kitchen object as so okay
27:43 - hello all right
27:46 - time is at 11 50. hmm
27:51 - uh okay all right so nowhere so far uh
27:55 - the main thing is waiting for is it
27:57 - going to spawn my recipe
28:01 - let's see no mega burger no come on
28:03 - spawn my own actually let me check the
28:07 - oh crap I'm actually sort of
28:10 - messing up something
28:12 - oh it did spawn
28:14 - type mismatch really
28:17 - I guess because it's Dynamic oh that's
28:19 - interesting I've never seen that happen
28:21 - before
28:23 - yeah why does this one say type mismatch
28:26 - because apparently it is correct so
28:28 - there it is my recipe so if I pick up
28:29 - one of these pick up a cube for some
28:32 - reason people want to eat cubes I don't
28:33 - know why uh okay so I add the cube on
28:36 - there now if I deliver it if there you
28:38 - go works all right awesome
28:40 - okay so that is great need to be a
28:43 - course suit no it's going to be a
28:44 - standalone tutorial on using uh use
28:47 - generate content pretty much adding more
28:49 - uh mods and things your voice sounds
28:51 - sick yep I'm physically fine but yeah my
28:54 - nose is all clogged up it's been like
28:56 - this for one week I actually wanted to
28:58 - make this live stream last week but I
29:00 - was all messed up and today I don't know
29:03 - I'm pretty much tired of waiting for my
29:05 - voice to come back to normal so that is
29:06 - why I decided to do it right away um
29:10 - okay so this did work I was able to
29:12 - generate a brand new kitchen object at
29:15 - runtime I was able to add it onto a
29:16 - plate and I was able to deliver the
29:18 - recipe so that was extremely pretty good
29:21 - and now if I leave yeah this is actually
29:23 - the problem hmm
29:26 - how am I going to handle a cleanup
29:28 - that's an interesting question
29:35 - maybe I add another list
29:38 - oh that is tricky
29:42 - that is actually interesting uh hmm
29:47 - I mean it's not a problem I can just
29:48 - manually delete it but
29:52 - on the recipe only says so let me see
29:54 - how many references do I have to this
29:57 - uh
29:59 - it's actually just one yeah
30:02 - so it could actually
30:05 - try and think could I emerge
30:08 - two recipes together
30:13 - okay
30:17 - basically it's the issue is that I'm
30:18 - modifying it's actually interesting
30:19 - because this is kind of like what I
30:21 - covered in the script ball objects video
30:22 - which is how in the editor this is
30:25 - actually modifying the sort of object
30:26 - whereas if this was running on build
30:27 - this would actually not be a problem
30:29 - because the script object would never be
30:31 - modified
30:32 - hmm
30:36 - okay I think right now I'll just leave
30:38 - it like this do it manually and then I
30:41 - won't see
30:43 - okay did the course made me want to
30:45 - learn code again think for the great
30:46 - course Ah that's awesome hey
30:48 - that's really great they invest in like
30:50 - in your own Learning Journey that's cool
30:52 - makes it on the list yeah that's what I
30:53 - was thinking about
30:55 - but then over here it would merge both
30:57 - lists so that would be a bit annoying
30:59 - but yeah I do think that is probably the
31:02 - best course of action so I do ugc
31:04 - recipes on list and then the only
31:07 - references over here on this one so this
31:09 - one
31:10 - I would do a public list of recipe so
31:14 - get full recipe so list
31:17 - and over here just return a new
31:20 - let me make a new list a list of recipe
31:22 - so so recipe so list let me actually
31:26 - call it the full recipe assemble list
31:28 - then on this one let's add range add the
31:31 - basic recipient so and the ugc recipe so
31:34 - just return the full recipe or so so
31:37 - yeah
31:38 - like this does work it's a bit annoying
31:41 - how it's pretty much wasting memory but
31:43 - really that's not quite an issue so
31:45 - unless the recipe so so the rest of BSN
31:48 - list just go into the recipe list so in
31:51 - order to get the phone rescue us on the
31:53 - list
31:53 - and then I just access this one and this
31:58 - one and like this yep it's going to do
32:00 - both of them and then on the other side
32:03 - on the kitchen game ugc
32:06 - what sport modding are you adding right
32:09 - now I'm just adding uh mod support for
32:12 - the game in order to be able to
32:13 - dynamically generate some recipes and
32:15 - some things and afterwards yep it will
32:18 - be implementing unity's ugc which is
32:20 - their user generated content tool which
32:24 - they've just launched into open Beta so
32:26 - this is what I am researching
32:29 - uh okay so where was I
32:33 - well this will add except I uh
32:37 - instead of that let me yeah all I got to
32:39 - do is basically just initialize it and
32:42 - then add it and this way it doesn't
32:45 - quite matter right yeah
32:47 - visualization can be so fun yeah I know
32:49 - I know
32:50 - okay
32:52 - all right
32:57 - uh
32:59 - okay so let me stone has zero but now as
33:03 - I spawn it should have one entry okay
33:07 - and there's actually an error why is
33:08 - there an error it only cannot be known
33:10 - what value
33:16 - UI elements
33:18 - okay that's odd because I'm not using UI
33:20 - elements
33:22 - all right anyways so now I close and
33:25 - that one still has a missing recipe
33:27 - that's fine because now if I
33:30 - select it against our new one it should
33:32 - destroy that one and spawn a brand new
33:33 - one and yep there you go type mismatch
33:37 - although this is very strange apparently
33:40 - the unity is having
33:42 - some weird bug parameter yunty self
33:46 - okay that's range apparently enty has
33:49 - some weird bug what if I don't select
33:51 - the object
33:55 - ugc was not a thing back when I added it
33:58 - yeah this is a recent tool but yeah it
34:01 - is similar to c-more shop of course the
34:04 - the obvious benefit is that Sim Workshop
34:06 - only works on Steam whereas this works
34:08 - anywhere so you can use this for like
34:10 - game Jam games that you publish on itch
34:13 - you could definitely use this to add
34:15 - some modding for that so that should be
34:16 - fun uh okay so that worked it just
34:20 - didn't spawn the recipe that I want let
34:22 - me actually
34:24 - uh modify this one let me put this one
34:26 - just one and then mine that way increase
34:29 - the odds that that one is going to work
34:31 - yeah 22. there's some weird bugs yeah I
34:34 - can't wait for 22 to actually go into
34:36 - LTS which should be hopefully soon
34:38 - somewhere on 22.2.17 and we're in the
34:42 - middle of that so yeah
34:44 - if your life has a Game Dev I'm
34:46 - definitely not good at making kind of
34:48 - Vlog content so I don't know I enjoy
34:51 - watching those videos but I don't think
34:53 - I'd be able to make an interesting one
34:54 - so yeah that would be interesting but
34:57 - yeah I need to learn how to work with
34:58 - cameras to do all kinds of real life
35:01 - footage and so on
35:03 - that of his own nope I've never seen it
35:05 - I've seen the movie though that was fun
35:07 - your vision moving that was has some
35:09 - interesting sounds so that was that was
35:12 - interesting
35:13 - um
35:14 - all right so basically with this I have
35:16 - successfully added some uh
35:19 - Dynamic recipe all right okay
35:24 - on the website using custom code yep it
35:26 - is I wrote I wrote it all using PHP from
35:29 - scratch so yeah no website builder no
35:32 - WordPress all of it like that uh all
35:35 - right okay so let me think Hmm
35:41 - okay so like this it is already working
35:43 - I can already generate a new kitchen
35:46 - object I can spawn the visual which is
35:49 - actually going to be quite tricky but
35:51 - anyways I can add it to the list I can
35:53 - create the recipe and do that all right
35:58 - so
36:01 - okay so now actually the next tricky
36:03 - thing is how on Earth am I going to
36:09 - okay let me think
36:16 - uh
36:21 - because basically uh all right so like
36:24 - this it is working now I need to somehow
36:25 - serialize all this data put it in some
36:27 - kind of binary something uh except
36:30 - Sprites that is gonna be
36:33 - a tricky thing
36:37 - okay so let me try to convert the
36:39 - kitchen object the so into a into a save
36:42 - file
36:44 - yeah I think the prefab is going to be
36:45 - the tricky thing
36:47 - how do I synchronize the mesh how do I
36:49 - make that into a marble thing uh okay so
36:54 - uh let's start by doing a public class
36:56 - for uh
36:59 - I don't know modded
37:02 - kitchen object or so something like this
37:06 - so now inside of it
37:12 - uh instead I'm going to need a string
37:14 - for the name so that's pretty basic
37:17 - actually this one shouldn't be the name
37:19 - should it yeah it should be the object
37:20 - name so I've been using this wrong
37:21 - doesn't really matter but anyways uh
37:24 - okay so I got the object name
37:26 - then I'm going to need the Sprite but
37:27 - for the Sprites actually not going to be
37:29 - the Sprite it's going to be some kind of
37:31 - PNG
37:33 - right yes
37:39 - oh so many messages I like working with
37:42 - cameras and modding
37:45 - and vlogging they're about in your life
37:48 - video with a cut scene cutscene made
37:51 - with Cynthia that would be a fun idea uh
37:55 - I don't know that could be that could be
37:56 - fun that could be interesting
37:59 - uh does modding Works online well yeah I
38:02 - mean modding is really just being able
38:04 - to dynamically load more data onto your
38:07 - game so yep
38:09 - what is ugc that's user generated
38:12 - content which is unity's recent tune
38:15 - which I'm currently researching in order
38:16 - to be able to make a video in the future
38:18 - okay so basically for the modded kitchen
38:21 - objects so I'm going to need an object
38:23 - name that I'm going to need
38:27 - actually yeah I'm thinking about this a
38:29 - bit wrong
38:31 - uh Hey new channel member thank you
38:34 - actually 3105
38:36 - what does the numbers mean uh thank you
38:39 - so much hey thank you for becoming a
38:40 - channel member
38:42 - I don't like making top-down games I
38:44 - don't know I just do I like an overhead
38:46 - camera I like strategy games I like
38:48 - being being able to see things so yeah
38:51 - uh okay so basically like this at its
38:54 - own all working now the next step is
38:56 - instead of using prefabs and Sprites I
38:58 - need to be able to dynamically load
39:03 - based on just my birthday wow so you're
39:06 - from the future that's fun uh
39:10 - uh I need to be able to so okay okay
39:14 - let me grab some texture actually I had
39:18 - some things that I was trying out yeah
39:19 - I've got a a nice uh Gamepad over here
39:25 - and actually yeah I was already
39:27 - researching this a while ago and I got a
39:29 - bunch of things I was unloading it
39:32 - um
39:37 - I was doing a file open
39:41 - shh
39:47 - I always feel that I'm writing code the
39:48 - wrong way I mean not to code itself but
39:50 - the game mechanics Pharaoh if it works
39:52 - it works yeah sure that's the main thing
39:55 - if it works then great it works and then
39:57 - over time obviously it's uh being able
40:00 - to do it not just that it works but that
40:01 - it works and importantly that it
40:03 - continues working in the future so yeah
40:06 - that's uh
40:07 - kind of thing in the beginning yep just
40:10 - working that's that's when enough but
40:13 - if it just works but it's really dirty
40:15 - then as the game development continues
40:17 - and becomes hard and harder to implement
40:19 - things add more things so that is why
40:21 - that is why clean code is so important
40:23 - it is not necessarily because it makes
40:25 - it better as you write it right away but
40:27 - rather when you come back to it after a
40:29 - week after a month you can still
40:31 - understand the code whereas if you write
40:32 - it quick and dirty you won't probably
40:34 - not understand it after quite some time
40:38 - hey new new memory thank you so much
40:41 - all right the Crux that's a nice name
40:43 - nice icon all right thank you so much
40:45 - for becoming a member it's nice thank
40:47 - you uh okay so let me think so basically
40:50 - I'm going to need the
40:54 - okay let me think let me think
40:57 - actually on the docs they had how to
41:03 - on the ugc docs they had it to convert
41:06 - into a Sprite
41:09 - yeah so I'm pretty much going to use
41:11 - this function okay so let me all right
41:14 - Focus sorry I'm a bit distracted trying
41:16 - to do a billion things at once so let me
41:18 - try to dynamically a little bit of
41:20 - sprite instead of doing it like this so
41:21 - let me grab it from a file so
41:25 - uh from a file do I do found that open
41:28 - because I'm trying to think of how would
41:30 - the mods be stored there would be as an
41:33 - array of bytes but I guess you know
41:36 - what's the difference between open and
41:38 - open read
41:39 - I assume those are the same actually so
41:41 - let me just
41:43 - so pick up the
41:45 - Gamepad okay this gives me a thumbnail
41:49 - stream
41:51 - can I just read it's always confusing
41:54 - how to read
41:57 - do I read them as bytes or not that's a
42:00 - good question
42:02 - uh
42:04 - no
42:06 - yeah I did have the the things so read
42:09 - it onto the byte array so by the array I
42:12 - read it I'm going to read this one onto
42:14 - the byte array and I'm going to yep
42:18 - okay so that reads it but then for the
42:21 - the code this one takes
42:25 - oh the load image
42:28 - I don't remember what is
42:30 - what is this one like the uh
42:33 - texture 2D
42:35 - this one dot load image does this one
42:37 - take it takes an array of bytes all
42:39 - right huh
42:42 - so will it actually work like this
42:45 - that's a good question
42:47 - so maybe this one did work where was I
42:49 - right here so pretty much just need to
42:51 - create a Sprite
42:54 - animation on change from script in my
42:56 - clone enemies
42:58 - what sorry I don't understand uh okay so
43:04 - creating a Sprite
43:08 - the double texture width and height yeah
43:11 - I think like this okay so let's see if
43:14 - this is loading that Gamepad Sprite
43:16 - dynamically because certainly if it does
43:18 - then actually this is going to be
43:20 - perhaps easier than I thought uh
43:23 - right I just forgot how do I okay so let
43:25 - me grab something now let me go into the
43:28 - player and the player is holding
43:30 - something
43:31 - players holding this hey thank you so
43:33 - much for becoming Channel member thank
43:35 - you uh so he's holding something which
43:37 - has a kitchen object so which in turn
43:39 - has a Sprite and if there you go there's
43:41 - a Sprite
43:42 - okay so that seemed like it worked
43:45 - all right
43:47 - different courses while I'm doing a
43:48 - full-time job the answer is learning a
43:50 - tiny tiny bit every single day that's
43:52 - pretty much it rather than doing sprints
43:54 - where you learn non-stop for 12 hours a
43:57 - day no instead of just focus on doing 30
43:59 - minutes in the night every single day
44:01 - whenever you have time that's pretty
44:03 - much How We Do It
44:08 - all right okay
44:11 - all right so this actually worked I
44:13 - actually loaded a
44:14 - thumbnail and loaded a bunch of bytes
44:16 - and that did work and I did get that
44:19 - certainly with this I could download the
44:21 - bytes from unity's ugc and everything
44:23 - would work so that would be nice
44:27 - uh then the tricky part is actually the
44:30 - mesh so that is actually going to be the
44:32 - Super tricky one and for the mesh from
44:35 - what I see it's actually quite tricky to
44:38 - Unity dynamically flowed a DOT fbx
44:42 - from what I see this actually quite true
44:45 - yeah this is what I saw that apparently
44:47 - obj is easier
44:52 - yeah does fbx belong to 3ds Max or
44:55 - Autodesk that's a question I don't know
44:58 - if fbx is
45:04 - shh but yeah basically yeah I remember
45:06 - researching this a while ago and
45:07 - basically loading fbx in runtime it's
45:10 - really difficult basically need to use
45:12 - asset bundles and things
45:14 - so maybe I could create the fbx's yeah
45:17 - fbx is used everywhere but apparently it
45:19 - seems to be some kind of close format so
45:22 - that is why it becomes a bit trickier
45:24 - and I think I saw that download instead
45:28 - of an fbx8. obj
45:32 - and I think that one should be easier
45:38 - foreign
45:44 - mods too uh I remember that I saw a
45:47 - question uh they asked the question on
45:49 - the uh GDC panel and the answer was that
45:52 - it depends on the platform basically
45:53 - there are some platforms where you can
45:54 - indeed definitely load code so I believe
45:57 - on Windows you can do it but for example
45:59 - on consoles I don't think you can do it
46:01 - and on iOS I don't think you can do it
46:04 - so that depends on the platforms but
46:07 - that really just refers to compound code
46:09 - things like c-sharp uh that is why for
46:12 - most part mods use something like Lewis
46:14 - so some kind of scripting language so if
46:17 - you're going to go into Mods yeah using
46:19 - Lewis seems like it would be the better
46:21 - approach as opposed to actually using uh
46:25 - actually using uh what am I saying C
46:28 - sharp yeah okay
46:32 - so I think obj would be better what is
46:35 - this obj importer oh great
46:38 - Unity week is now oh no uh
46:43 - for new BJ at runtime in unity
46:48 - the question is does unity have a
46:51 - built-in imported or not that's the
46:54 - thing I wanted to use something that was
46:56 - built in
46:59 - the title BJ is this a assets or two
47:01 - only a oh it appears to be free but yeah
47:05 - I want to
47:07 - uh
47:10 - yeah that's what's going to be okay
47:12 - anyways but yeah I do think that obj
47:14 - does work
47:16 - so the first thing is actually confirm
47:23 - or maybe just hmm
47:31 - yeah the obj important yeah because I
47:34 - think this is the
47:36 - but the other one did have
47:39 - so Unity the obj important is this a
47:42 - thing no that one's just the acid store
47:44 - ah crap uh the sr2 something on GitHub
47:48 - there's a model importer
47:52 - well import settings from editor scripts
47:54 - no I don't want editor Scripts
47:57 - on it in runtime
48:03 - I mean I guess technically I could
48:05 - import the mesh no that would be
48:06 - annoying I mean technically it would
48:07 - work but
48:09 - yeah
48:10 - yeah pretty much everyone is pointing to
48:12 - that too I mean I guess if need be maybe
48:16 - I won't use that one since it appears to
48:18 - be free so yeah hey look at that nice
48:21 - car and that's fun what do you want obj
48:23 - I'm trying to do modding and I want the
48:25 - players to be able to mod also the
48:28 - visual for the recipe
48:31 - and yeah that would be the
48:34 - tricky thing because apparently
48:36 - um
48:39 - during runtime apparently in unity
48:43 - yeah Dynamic mesh loader yeah Dynamic
48:45 - loading of the mesh data that would
48:49 - work
48:53 - maybe I might look into that one anyways
48:54 - uh okay so I think I'll check that out
48:57 - later and for now try to get this one
49:00 - yobj over fvx because apparently fbx is
49:03 - proprietary and it's really difficult to
49:06 - import in runtime that's pretty much the
49:08 - only reason because from what I saw that
49:10 - one is really tricky and obj seems to be
49:12 - easier at runtime so for making mods
49:15 - that one appears to be better
49:17 - [Music]
49:19 - okay
49:29 - all right okay so I guess for now let me
49:32 - worry about that in a little bit and for
49:35 - now maybe let's try working with the
49:37 - actual ugc thing in order to try to
49:41 - upload and download the mods but for
49:43 - that okay let me think because ugc does
49:45 - have a slight limitation which is that
49:47 - it only supports one file so basically I
49:49 - need to open everything onto just one
49:52 - file so I need to go into the kitchen
49:55 - game EGC and I need to make some kind of
49:58 - file format
50:00 - you have an obj important
50:01 - it does but apparently it's only on the
50:03 - editor so that's the issue it works in
50:06 - the editor but not in runtime so yeah
50:07 - that is going to be a little bit tricky
50:09 - uh
50:11 - okay so for static data I'm going to
50:13 - have someone like the object name
50:17 - okay okay let me start writing and think
50:20 - at the same time
50:25 - uh
50:27 - yeah actually input
50:29 - imagine
50:31 - uh that crap my brain isn't working uh
50:36 - all right so I want to file and
50:37 - basically on a file I went to public a
50:40 - byte array for the icon by the ray then
50:44 - I'm eventually going to have also for
50:46 - the other one
50:48 - and for the object name so this is also
50:50 - going to be a byte array for the for the
50:52 - what do I call it
50:54 - uh Json data
50:58 - maybe something like this uh
51:03 - because if I call it name uh nah
51:06 - nah because yeah it just has a name so
51:10 - name byte array then I need a public
51:15 - I'm trying to think trying to think
51:18 - it's learning optimization important as
51:19 - a beginner mini Depends for the most
51:22 - part if your game runs and that's great
51:24 - then afterwards focus on optimization so
51:27 - I wouldn't worry about it from the very
51:28 - beginning but yeah
51:31 - steam doesn't have an API or some
51:33 - handlebots yep seem does have Steam
51:35 - Workshop so Unity is trying to sort of
51:38 - compete with that with this new tool
51:40 - with the user generated content tool so
51:42 - should be interesting it does have a
51:44 - bunch of Pros so a bunch of things since
51:46 - uh steam hasn't really had much uh
51:48 - Improvement since Steam Workshop was
51:50 - announced which was like 10 years ago so
51:52 - yeah they're trying to
51:54 - push it forward so if you just join
51:56 - recently this is what I'm talking about
51:58 - their latest fuel on user generate
52:00 - content uh
52:03 - can load an animation oh really I didn't
52:06 - know that but yeah right now animation
52:08 - is not something that I'm thinking about
52:10 - for this type of modding but yeah it's a
52:12 - good to know that limitation okay
52:16 - uh this Roadshow reminded me that I
52:18 - wasn't surprised all right thank you
52:20 - uh okay so let me think all right so I
52:24 - need the icon by Terrain
52:27 - okay so I need that I need the name but
52:31 - then I need the offset right
52:35 - try and think how did I handle this ah
52:38 - crap I don't
52:40 - let me go back and re-watch one of my
52:42 - videos
52:44 - because I don't remember how that I
52:45 - implement it my brain is drawing a blank
52:48 - right now
52:52 - yeah right so I've got
52:57 - uh
52:59 - get a Json converted into that no
53:02 - where's the header because I was seeing
53:04 - the header
53:07 - where did I put the header
53:15 - right so for the header I just put the
53:17 - Json byte size and then on the Json bite
53:21 - size
53:22 - over there I hold the rest yeah of
53:25 - course and look at my own videos to
53:26 - remember how I did things that's pretty
53:27 - much it uh
53:31 - yeah so essentially I need the header I
53:33 - need the header to contain the byte size
53:38 - and then yeah I had just the
53:42 - the header bytes as just a u short right
53:45 - yeah exactly
53:46 - exactly
53:54 - and then I have
53:57 - because I'm trying to think the reason
53:58 - is working with bytes is always so
54:00 - tricky uh
54:04 - but yeah I have some kind of header
54:06 - class and on the header I've got a
54:09 - public
54:10 - uh yeah for the Json bite size that's
54:13 - really all I need Json byte size
54:16 - uh so probably class for the found data
54:21 - and then on the found data I'm going to
54:23 - have a public hand for the icon byte
54:25 - array and another one for the name
54:29 - byte array size so this is size for both
54:33 - of these
54:37 - just trying to think how do I convert
54:39 - this into a file and without it
54:43 - so okay let me do a public void and I'm
54:46 - going to
54:47 - pull some save
54:50 - and over here let me receive a do I take
54:55 - a
54:56 - yeah so a string for the what are you
55:00 - called for the uh
55:02 - icon path
55:04 - then we have a string for the name or
55:07 - the object name something like that
55:12 - okay so for the icon path
55:18 - can you do a repab basically I'm doing
55:20 - research in order to be able to do the
55:23 - easier to generate content but actually
55:25 - right now on this live stream I've
55:26 - already managed to get quite a bit
55:27 - working so
55:29 - thing that I got right now is already
55:30 - working quite well
55:33 - so
55:34 - I've got the game and I dynamically
55:36 - generated a kitchen object to sell so
55:38 - here are the regular kitchen objects so
55:40 - some tomato I can slice it and so on and
55:42 - then over here I've got a a kitchen
55:44 - object which is just a basic Cube so
55:47 - this was generated in runtime rather
55:48 - than being built into the game itself so
55:50 - this would be the example of a mod I can
55:52 - add it onto a plate and there you go it
55:54 - has a nice icon and then I can deliver
55:56 - it my recipe and there you go success
55:59 - so yeah
56:01 - If you experience a crash uh sometimes
56:04 - not much but yeah sometimes
56:07 - my Super Chat just did not show up
56:10 - Super Chat
56:12 - I didn't see anything
56:17 - that's odd
56:19 - um
56:21 - okay so I got the icon path and I need
56:23 - to basically yeah basically loaded
56:26 - into bytes
56:30 - go into the icon path
56:34 - so unload it downloaded into the byte
56:37 - race that is going to be the icon byte
56:40 - array
56:44 - and then the bytes red so let me go
56:47 - found data found data equals a new found
56:50 - data
56:52 - then on the found data dot icon byte
56:56 - array size it's going to be this guy
57:00 - okay
57:02 - it's your favorite asset I mean that is
57:04 - really difficult because there are so
57:06 - many assets that do so many things so
57:09 - it really depends on the context if you
57:11 - want to make talk about visuals analog
57:13 - City Studios talking about tools I love
57:15 - things like Ray fire or something
57:17 - actually Unity has a spring sale
57:19 - starting later today so stay tuned for
57:22 - my video doing an overview of my
57:24 - favorite tests on the sale but yeah
57:26 - there are so many awesome tools that can
57:29 - really help speed up the process so yeah
57:33 - of course learning how to make an FPS
57:34 - game uh I've got my visual uh visual
57:37 - scripting course does have an FPS game
57:39 - but yeah in terms of regular code no I
57:41 - haven't done one of those that would be
57:43 - interesting
57:45 - okay
57:49 - why isn't real struggling with mobile
57:51 - ports but they can rent Millions on PC
57:54 - because those are completely different
57:56 - architectures so rendering a game on a
57:59 - PC isn't really the same as rendering it
58:01 - on a mobile chip those are completely
58:03 - different things and for them they spend
58:06 - most of their engineering resources on
58:08 - targeting high-end machines so that's
58:10 - pretty much it
58:12 - SMD YouTuber ah thank you that's nice uh
58:15 - okay so let me let me think
58:18 - uh okay so I'm basically setting the
58:20 - icon by terrain the name and I've got
58:22 - that one okay great so then eventually
58:25 - I'm going to need to convert the file
58:27 - data I'm going to convert Json utility
58:29 - dot to Json
58:31 - convert this found data into Json so the
58:34 - strings will file data Json
58:37 - I found that read on by Tia good
58:39 - question yeah good point because I was
58:40 - yeah because I was using it like this
58:42 - just because this is what the the
58:45 - documentation for ugc was using just
58:47 - using file.open because the uh uh where
58:50 - it is over here yeah because then for
58:52 - uploading content they require a file
58:55 - stream so that is why I'm using this
58:57 - method but yeah over here for for my own
58:59 - method when all I want is just some byte
59:02 - array then yeah I found out read on
59:03 - bytes would indeed be
59:05 - quite a bit easier um
59:08 - okay so foundat.json then a header
59:11 - header equals a new header and on the
59:14 - header I need to put the Json byte size
59:16 - uh
59:18 - all right now I don't remember uh how do
59:20 - I convert this into yeah I really should
59:22 - probably yeah
59:24 - the uh
59:26 - encoding Dot
59:29 - I never know should I use unique code or
59:32 - should I use etf8 I never know which one
59:34 - is supposedly the best but
59:37 - get bytes
59:41 - isn't it get bites
59:43 - yeah let's get bytes facing the found
59:45 - that Json so that Returns the byte array
59:49 - for the file
59:51 - data bytes byte array
59:56 - uh okay so this is actually something
59:58 - that I need to store as well
60:01 - okay
60:03 - perform both because they spend tons of
60:06 - their engineering effort on supporting
60:08 - all the platforms that's really it
60:09 - there's no magic within the engine
60:12 - itself it just depends on what your
60:13 - focus is
60:15 - that same reason why unreal usually has
60:17 - better visuals than Unity because that
60:20 - is their main focus so
60:22 - yeah hmm
60:24 - I don't know after finishing the
60:26 - multiplayer courses beginner maybe don't
60:27 - look into my turn-based strategy course
60:29 - which I'm also working on a free
60:31 - expansion for that one so if you want to
60:34 - learn about good clean code then yeah
60:36 - that course would be very nice if you go
60:39 - to that one if you value good clean code
60:42 - then that course will really help you
60:44 - all right uh okay so for the Json byte
60:48 - size I'm going to be this one dot length
60:54 - so then I need the end for the header
60:57 - size
60:58 - X except it's not an INF it's a u short
61:01 - so I can see the expansion yeah it's
61:03 - going surprisingly well I thought it was
61:05 - going to be really tricky to handle
61:06 - multiple levels but it was actually
61:09 - surprisingly easy so that was that was
61:12 - good
61:12 - uh
61:15 - yeah for the header size I just take the
61:17 - link converted it into that one
61:22 - oh yeah so that's what I was that's what
61:24 - I was doing so I convert the header size
61:27 - at a u short so
61:31 - wait do I need the um
61:36 - oh I converted a header into Json as
61:39 - well right yeah it makes sense so Json
61:41 - utility.2 Json
61:43 - for the header so that's the string for
61:45 - the header Json
61:48 - so there is this one done on this one
61:52 - I convert it into a byte array so the
61:54 - same thing encoding Dot unicode.getbytes
61:59 - get bytes for the header Json this
62:01 - returns a byte array for the header byte
62:05 - array
62:06 - and then for the harder sizes on that
62:08 - link and just need to convert it into a
62:10 - u short
62:11 - so basically the header size needs to be
62:13 - of a certain thing
62:15 - and then I've got the byte array for the
62:17 - header size byte array
62:20 - which is going to be the header size
62:25 - uh as a battery how do I do it
62:27 - apparently I use bit converter
62:29 - in order to get the bytes
62:33 - get the bytes of this Setter size
62:37 - okay
62:40 - right so basically with that I've got
62:44 - okay hey thank you for being here thanks
62:46 - for watching the videos I hope the
62:48 - videos have been helpful for your
62:50 - Learning Journey that's pretty much what
62:52 - I do and thank you all for being here
62:54 - watching on this random unplanned live
62:56 - stream yeah
63:03 - Okay so
63:09 - crap I really
63:10 - I should probably just open up that
63:12 - thumb that would probably be easier
63:14 - Works easy just watching you on stream
63:16 - does it because on stream I'm definitely
63:20 - uh struggling quite a bit more than on a
63:23 - final published video because that's
63:24 - just how game development Works what you
63:26 - see on the final video is really the the
63:28 - the final polish video so that doesn't
63:30 - include all the time that I spent just
63:32 - trial and error just trying to figure
63:34 - out how do I do all this how do I store
63:36 - all the bytes in a single file that is
63:38 - always super difficult so it's
63:41 - interesting all right so right on bytes
63:44 - and this one takes a path and then just
63:47 - a byte array
63:49 - some list of bytes so the complete by
63:52 - the list
63:54 - I think there's going to seeing this
63:55 - wrong yeah definitely I mean it can
63:56 - definitely give a misleading picture if
63:59 - all you watch is just fine on polished
64:00 - videos it seems that everything is way
64:02 - too easy but yeah you feel a lot behind
64:04 - it for every single tutorial that you
64:06 - watch there's tons and tons of work that
64:08 - goes before uh behind the actual
64:11 - published video so yeah
64:14 - how do I know when the live streams are
64:16 - happening I mean I don't really have a
64:17 - fixed schedule I just do them when I
64:20 - when when I have some kind of work to do
64:22 - that also fits well on a live stream so
64:25 - yeah the the way I just use the the uh
64:28 - the Bell icon on YouTube or maybe on the
64:31 - website sign up to receive emails and
64:34 - yeah that's pretty much it I usually
64:35 - send an email and set it live about 10
64:38 - minutes before I go live so yeah I wish
64:40 - there was maybe one day I won't have a
64:42 - fixed schedule we're at a certain time
64:44 - per week I will always be but yeah for
64:46 - the most part the live streams are very
64:48 - much uh improvised so yeah it's kind of
64:52 - hard to say ahead of time
64:54 - okay so this one is two array and let me
64:56 - put this on application.crap
65:01 - dot data path plus uh byte save dot
65:06 - bytes something like this
65:09 - okay so for the complete button list
65:12 - I'm going to add actually add range now
65:16 - add
65:17 - so add range
65:20 - I first add the Heather bite size
65:24 - okay so that tells me the
65:27 - size of the header which in turn is
65:29 - going to tell me
65:33 - right yeah yeah I think that's trying to
65:36 - remember how I how I did this but yeah
65:38 - pretty much it just runs one of your
65:40 - last videos you are 100 not perfect just
65:42 - awesome that's nice thank you yeah I'm
65:44 - definitely not perfect I definitely I
65:46 - try my best to do things but yep just
65:49 - because I do something that does not
65:50 - mean it's the only way there are only so
65:52 - many ways to solve every problem so yeah
65:57 - uh okay so I had the header size all
66:00 - right with that I can then read the
66:01 - header bytes
66:03 - by reading the Heather bytes I can then
66:04 - read uh
66:06 - yeah the Heather byte array
66:08 - does include that right
66:11 - I'm trying to think
66:14 - actually let me do a quick test just
66:16 - make sure that all of this is indeed
66:18 - working so hey only going load
66:23 - actually why am I putting these inside
66:25 - the
66:26 - yeah
66:28 - yeah there's no need to put this inside
66:30 - so I have no idea why I'm putting them
66:32 - inside this
66:34 - font anyways it doesn't doesn't matter
66:36 - I'll clean it up after a little bit uh
66:40 - okay so front load from the read yeah
66:42 - over here let me use the readout bytes
66:44 - let me use the exact same path
66:47 - just read that so this is the byte array
66:49 - for the complete byte array
66:52 - and yeah so let me do a debug download
66:55 - this one dot length
66:59 - so bytes
67:01 - let's see this and over here before I
67:03 - save it let's go to this one
67:07 - the account let's see this okay so let
67:10 - me just do a quick test because I
67:11 - haven't tested anything in ages so let's
67:13 - just make sure this is working
67:15 - so let me just create this object
67:19 - and then on this guy let me call Save
67:22 - and this guy let me call load except for
67:26 - Save I need to pass in something even
67:28 - though I'm not really using this right
67:30 - now but okay let's just do it like this
67:34 - and the object name my object is a real
67:37 - map
67:38 - uh uh all right so let's test and see if
67:41 - this does work okay
67:44 - someone can add their own recipe to the
67:46 - game yep that's that's the only that's
67:47 - what I'm trying to do trying to make it
67:50 - so that you can mod new recipes new
67:52 - objects and new things so let's run and
67:55 - see if there's any error and after a
67:58 - while and hope it did work all right so
68:00 - it saved 40 bytes and it loaded 40 bytes
68:03 - okay so that's good so now these 40
68:04 - bytes I want to get them back so how do
68:08 - I get the array
68:09 - can I slice it away I don't think I can
68:11 - no so let me make a list of bite
68:15 - that list of bite uh complete by the
68:20 - list equals a new list of byte let me
68:23 - convert the array onto a list
68:25 - then onto this list I can call can I
68:28 - slice
68:30 - okay now I'm confused
68:33 - doesn't the list have a slice function
68:35 - pretty sure oh no it's copy two yeah
68:39 - that's exactly especially does the
68:40 - battery also have a copy two yeah it
68:43 - also does
68:46 - copy to an array with an index
68:49 - but wasn't there a way to grab something
68:51 - that's actually interesting I thought it
68:53 - did
68:54 - but
68:56 - it's an extension oh that's interesting
69:01 - and on the list
69:03 - yeah you got add range would be nice to
69:06 - have a slice I thought it had but
69:08 - apparently not
69:09 - oh get range okay so maybe this is what
69:12 - I want okay so this is what I want all
69:13 - right I knew there was something all
69:15 - right so get range so on zero
69:19 - and now I need to remember
69:22 - how big is a u-short
69:24 - I think it's two bites right yeah I
69:27 - think it's two bites
69:30 - yeah I think so so this is going to be a
69:31 - list of bite
69:33 - so the Heather bite list
69:36 - it's going to be this
69:40 - and then
69:43 - it's nice and easy sharp version so
69:44 - really they're improving list that's fun
69:47 - uh okay so yeah I think it's on the bit
69:51 - convert I should really just go and grab
69:53 - down so you short
69:57 - you see you short a and 16
70:02 - uh good question
70:08 - is it oh yeah it is it returns to you
70:10 - short it's always confusing how there
70:12 - are so many names but yeah
70:15 - so this one into a white list
70:18 - does not work do you need
70:21 - do you not work with the list it takes a
70:23 - span or a byte Valley so to array and
70:26 - then start index is on zero so it's
70:28 - going to return you short for the header
70:30 - uh break on header size
70:35 - to get your animations and sound effects
70:37 - I mean mostly from the accessor the SSR
70:40 - or humble bubbles or any kind of sales
70:42 - that's pretty much it I mean the SSR has
70:44 - tons and tons of stuff and if you want
70:46 - to find them for free there was a good
70:48 - sound or was it free sound is that the
70:50 - name yeah that's the one so if you want
70:52 - sound effects and this one has a bunch
70:54 - of free ones which are fun definitely
70:55 - take a look at the uh licenses but yeah
70:58 - if you're looking for free sounds that
71:00 - is a good one
71:03 - the UI section
71:05 - where the first icon recipe is showing
71:07 - when the second one is added it sounds
71:09 - like you probably forgot to answer the
71:11 - uh you forgot to disable the template
71:13 - that is usually the issue it is
71:15 - basically showing the template and then
71:17 - whatever is on there
71:19 - um why don't you use the VAR keyword
71:21 - personally I don't like it I find that
71:22 - it makes the code hard to read I want to
71:25 - be very explicit about what type I'm
71:27 - working with so personally I do not like
71:29 - VAR but if you do then definitely use it
71:33 - for example on the for example over here
71:35 - on the docs Unity themselves like to use
71:38 - Varn personally I don't like it but yeah
71:40 - if you don't like it then definitely uh
71:43 - look into it
71:44 - save it but seems the same problem well
71:47 - you can download the project files for
71:48 - that lecture and compare with your own
71:50 - so
71:51 - maybe you set up something different in
71:54 - the prefab something like that
71:55 - CNT asset spring sale starting exactly
71:57 - starting today in about uh I think it's
72:01 - at 4 P.M so there will be in about four
72:03 - or five hours so yeah
72:08 - all right uh let me just
72:11 - um debug that log
72:13 - the Heather size
72:16 - the
72:17 - other size
72:19 - let me just see if this one yeah
72:24 - so just up here let me just see what you
72:26 - debug.log
72:28 - saving
72:30 - and then down here the Volvo Vlog just
72:32 - saying loading all right
72:36 - okay so let's see if this is working so
72:39 - far
72:40 - text mesh Pro
72:42 - specifically with a countdown
72:45 - uh I don't know what specific issue you
72:48 - have with a countdown but I do have a
72:50 - countdown on the kitchen chaos game so
72:54 - you can definitely look into how I did
72:56 - that one so that is I was on the you can
73:00 - watch the course it's on the Polish
73:01 - stage over here I added the countdown so
73:04 - if you go and watch the Polish stage
73:06 - lecture you should be able to see how
73:08 - implemented the countdown
73:10 - code this light screen my eyes are
73:12 - burning already well that's what happens
73:14 - to me on the opposite which is on the
73:17 - uh on dark mode the misborne um
73:21 - Heather size 38
73:24 - oh right it's not
73:26 - yeah it's not using 38 bytes it's just
73:29 - exactly the header size itself is 30
73:32 - okay so that did work okay great
73:36 - yes okay so invite offset equals the
73:41 - username on that one
73:43 - or let's go inside offset equals zero
73:47 - then byte offset plus equals two then on
73:51 - the complete byte list once again let me
73:53 - call get range and I'm going to get
73:55 - range on the byte offset
73:58 - and for the count so what is the one
74:01 - that I want so basically I've got the
74:04 - exactly using the Heather size
74:07 - I want to get that range
74:11 - and that is going to give me the header
74:14 - size by the array or actually it has a
74:16 - size byte list equals out so a list of
74:20 - byte
74:21 - yeah
74:24 - you have to go to the bathroom during
74:26 - the live stream no I I never do live
74:29 - streams that are that long so yeah so
74:31 - far that has not been an issue
74:33 - but yeah
74:35 - other size okay
74:40 - so this is the how to size byte list
74:43 - that gets me that so now I just need to
74:46 - reverse
74:47 - this one
74:50 - place I think that I'm doing this right
74:52 - so get string
74:55 - and I'll take the byte list can you take
74:57 - it by the list nope
74:58 - oh these only work with the Rays that's
75:00 - a bit annoying but okay
75:03 - so for the Heather Json then Heather
75:06 - Heather equals Json utility Dot from
75:09 - Json of type header for the Heather Json
75:14 - uh yep
75:17 - so the other size that one did work and
75:19 - the bug don't log going to the Heather
75:22 - and let me grab the
75:24 - Json bite size
75:28 - yeah exactly then on the header I hold
75:30 - the Json byte size and then also the
75:33 - image byte size then I put both them
75:35 - okay
75:36 - externalization for save mode yeah but
75:38 - over here I'm not uh working just with
75:41 - serializable types that is what I need
75:42 - to work with byte arrays okay
75:48 - because on the file I'm going to need to
75:50 - store the image icon so that is why I
75:53 - need to work with bytes instead of doing
75:56 - basal serialization
75:58 - um
76:00 - okay so the other Json bite size
76:03 - is it an inspiration Ah that's awesome
76:05 - I'm glad the videos have humped you on
76:07 - your Learning Journey let's go with them
76:09 - so thank you uh okay
76:16 - so let's see if this one is loading the
76:18 - Json bite size
76:21 - well let's print the exact same thing up
76:23 - here
76:25 - okay let's see if that one is working
76:28 - what time is it midday 40 yeah my voice
76:31 - already quite a bit messed up I think
76:33 - Newton's South Json is more powerful it
76:36 - kind of is but it also has issues like
76:38 - that one has a very very annoying bug
76:41 - which is regarding the um
76:44 - how it has issues with serializing
76:46 - Vector is it Vector three yeah it's
76:47 - Vector threes because the vector 3 has a
76:50 - forward which in turn is a vector 3 so
76:53 - it causes a a
76:55 - Loop cycle thing so yeah every time that
76:58 - I've used it it is always super tricky
76:59 - so that is why for the most part when
77:01 - working with the entity I tend to use
77:02 - Json utility
77:04 - yeah
77:05 - uh okay so anyway so with this I've got
77:09 - the
77:11 - I've got the header so then I just need
77:14 - my final data so this is the one that I
77:17 - converted into
77:18 - Json right
77:24 - actually I could put it on the header
77:26 - anyways right now I just want to make
77:28 - sure that I get working
77:33 - so that one
77:34 - the
77:37 - Heather has the Json bite size which is
77:40 - going to be the founder array okay so
77:43 - let me continue doing pretty much the
77:44 - exact same thing
77:47 - so instead of the header what did I call
77:49 - it because I called it yeah front data
77:52 - found that
77:54 - fight list
77:58 - uh starting off on that one going into
78:01 - this bite size and then for the byte
78:04 - offset was equals by this one
78:07 - I mean videos before starting a big
78:10 - project in terms of must and mustins
78:13 - uh I don't know what tips is take good
78:16 - control of how you ride here hey Jason
78:19 - sorry hey nice thanks for being here
78:23 - right custom converter that replace the
78:25 - converting process not only serializes
78:27 - the properties
78:29 - yeah if you have questions about
78:31 - serialization then Json is definitely
78:33 - the person you shouldn't listen to yeah
78:35 - uh
78:40 - fine it's really 33 or three valleys oh
78:43 - that's nice yeah working with
78:44 - compression that is definitely an
78:46 - interesting thing I remember that I used
78:48 - a
78:48 - some kind of compressional Library I
78:50 - don't remember the name but I remember
78:51 - that for my first theme game I did have
78:53 - that issue where my my
78:56 - um
78:57 - where my save files were super huge they
78:59 - weren't like megabytes long because I
79:01 - was just serializing tons and tons of
79:02 - data now remember that I used some
79:04 - compression and converted into like 50
79:06 - kilobytes so that was that was fun that
79:09 - was interesting I didn't do it myself I
79:10 - just used some kind of library but yeah
79:11 - that was uh interesting
79:14 - um
79:16 - right so let me just now pretty much
79:19 - I got that one so let's go into Unicode
79:21 - get string and let me grab the file data
79:26 - so this is going to be a string for the
79:28 - found that in Json and then found data
79:31 - file data equal Json Italy uh from Json
79:36 - a type file data and let me pick up the
79:39 - found.json
79:41 - and of course this doesn't work with
79:43 - lists so need to do it with arrays so
79:46 - that grabs me the foundation and now
79:48 - with this one
79:50 - I finally have those two okay so almost
79:52 - getting there it's definitely yeah if
79:54 - you're watching this might seem
79:56 - way too convoluted but hopefully it will
79:59 - make sense in the final tutorial video
80:02 - um okay so the icon byte array size
80:09 - inside to save the map oh nice
80:13 - to a bit shifted compressed texture
80:16 - oh wow
80:18 - wow five megabytes into 50 kilobytes
80:20 - that's awesome wow that's insane that
80:23 - sounds really cool yeah
80:25 - bit shifted into a compressed section
80:27 - wow that's that sounds really hardcore
80:29 - right yeah nice uh thank you I'm glad
80:31 - you enjoyed the course it's awesome
80:33 - uh okay
80:36 - so the
80:38 - all right so yeah let me just up here
80:41 - let me put in log on that one
80:43 - see if that one is working and let's see
80:46 - if that one is loading the same bytes
80:50 - oh yeah and I didn't even notice that
80:53 - I'm spawning pen spinning yeah it's a
80:55 - it's a fun thing when you're busy
80:59 - oh boy
81:01 - look at that I think Unity wow look at
81:03 - that it happened
81:05 - yinty randomly crashes on me and now
81:07 - apparently the okay so did I mess up
81:09 - something working with bytes I don't
81:12 - know but yeah that was unexpected
81:16 - uh uh this one yeah
81:19 - all right so there you go classic
81:26 - yeah because this was
81:30 - I don't know did I
81:32 - yeah I don't think I did
81:34 - yeah just working with bytes but
81:35 - apparently
81:36 - something went wrong
81:40 - it's gonna crash again
81:46 - didn't Crush now but
81:48 - also the links were bounds okay so
81:51 - apparently I'm
82:01 - the offset and pounds were
82:11 - they hmm
82:16 - because so far it was
82:20 - part of said increased by the header
82:22 - size
82:24 - let me see the uh
82:26 - because I didn't actually see yeah the
82:27 - byte save is over here
82:29 - yeah 40 kilobytes so got on the bytes
82:32 - there okay
82:42 - yeah because the header size was correct
82:44 - wasn't it
82:47 - so why is this one it's kind of the
82:49 - issue when working with bytes that when
82:51 - things go wrong they go really wrong
82:58 - a tutorial about optimization on mobile
83:01 - that is a very broad topic so that has
83:04 - the best thing when it comes to
83:06 - optimization is really just learn how to
83:08 - use the profiler so window analysis
83:10 - profiler
83:11 - so learn how to use this in order to
83:13 - figure out what exactly is taking time
83:15 - because optimization is a giant topic
83:18 - with so many possible
83:20 - examples reasons so yeah there's no it's
83:23 - when those topics that is really
83:24 - important important impossible to make a
83:26 - general tutorial because every game is
83:28 - going to be different so yeah just focus
83:30 - on reducing draw calls reduce how often
83:33 - you run code all kinds of things so yeah
83:36 - basically learning how to use the
83:37 - profiler is the best thing you can do
83:40 - um
83:41 - okay so this one was actually
83:46 - all right
83:49 - oh never mind because I didn't add it
83:51 - yeah I'm not I'm not very smart no I'm
83:53 - not
83:54 - uh right so the founder byte array yeah
83:58 - I kind of need to add it if I don't add
84:00 - it then obviously it's actually not
84:02 - going to read it that's kind of obvious
84:06 - step three UI draw calls yeah UI can
84:08 - definitely be a big performance killer
84:11 - yeah
84:14 - especially for me I mean usually I make
84:16 - games on on PC so I don't have to worry
84:19 - about it too much but I really enjoy
84:21 - using uh World space canvases and yeah
84:24 - those generate tons of draw calls so
84:26 - yeah and Atlas is yeah I remember that I
84:29 - was one of my Steam games yeah I was
84:31 - before adding the the uh generating the
84:35 - Sprite Atlas and afterwards the
84:36 - difference was really massive so yeah
84:38 - definitely look into those those are
84:40 - great tips all right and now it worked
84:42 - nowhere okay awesome all right uh
84:46 - so the phone
84:51 - yeah because that's really all that I
84:52 - need then I add the icon
84:54 - in the name yeah right now I don't even
84:56 - care about the name so let me just add
84:58 - the icon byte array
85:01 - then finally over here I've got that one
85:03 - okay
85:04 - so then I can go into my complete by
85:08 - list in order to get the range and let
85:10 - me get the range on this byte offset and
85:13 - then for the size that is going to be
85:15 - the found data dot the icon by the right
85:17 - size so that is going to be a list of
85:20 - bytes and that is going to be the icon
85:22 - byte list
85:24 - and with that one I'm going to have a
85:27 - byte list and then I can finally do
85:30 - exactly this I basically read the bytes
85:32 - and unload them into the
85:34 - texture yeah the byte array
85:38 - uh
85:41 - okay so yeah so I don't think I can
85:43 - actually
85:44 - test this out
85:46 - yeah
85:48 - crap
85:49 - to Ray
85:53 - cast mode helps performance you oh does
85:55 - it oh that's something that I never
85:56 - tried out hey Margie hey Jack you're
85:59 - here hey nice how's it going
86:02 - all right I hope it was productive I
86:04 - hope you had fun back in Australia I
86:07 - hope that you weren't attacked by any
86:08 - giant spiders oh
86:13 - why Australia is an interesting country
86:15 - but the
86:17 - the uh existence of giant man-eating
86:20 - spiders that really puts me off so yeah
86:25 - um are you Portuguese yep I am yeah
86:28 - uh right so you can do a debug download
86:31 - on the on this Sprite just see if it
86:34 - does work
86:35 - let's see if it does work
86:39 - not only that the final is 136 bytes
86:43 - is that it that doesn't seem right
86:51 - it says one
86:53 - 136 bytes but
86:57 - oh because I didn't add it right yeah
86:59 - that was before I had the thing so yeah
87:02 - speds are not that bad really because
87:04 - I've seen some pictures and they seem
87:06 - pretty bad
87:08 - uh right I didn't look at that these
87:11 - Sprites all right so technically this
87:13 - did work so let me do unload
87:17 - out Sprite Sprite and onto this Sprite
87:21 - let me output this Sprite
87:24 - use the black Unity editor because I
87:27 - like uh the light theme basically dark
87:30 - mode burns my eyes and light theme
87:32 - that's the thing for me and okay so on
87:35 - the load let me do
87:37 - out ah crap out Sprite Sprite
87:43 - so let me just do this right on the
87:45 - start
87:46 - and now instead of doing all this
87:49 - now I just go straight into that file
87:52 - and let me actually just load and not
87:54 - save
87:57 - okay
87:58 - so with this he should be able to get
88:00 - the Sprite
88:02 - and the Sprite should be added on to
88:04 - that one even though right now
88:05 - technically it's not going it's on based
88:08 - on that one file
88:09 - which is how big is it now yeah now it's
88:13 - three kilobytes all right so this is the
88:14 - entire mod file just has exactly that
88:17 - okay
88:19 - isn't there a built-in meth download
88:20 - Sprites yeah this is the only built-in
88:22 - method it's basically down you have to
88:26 - create a new texture 2D then you can't
88:29 - load the image in order to load bytes
88:30 - onto that texture 2D so that loads the
88:32 - image and then you create the Sprites
88:34 - that's pretty much the only thing okay
88:36 - so anyway so like this basically this is
88:38 - going to be loading this mod with that
88:40 - icon and let's see if it does work okay
88:54 - uh and now okay so so far so good no
88:57 - errors all right advice okay that's all
88:59 - good and I go and there you go and let's
89:02 - see if the icon didn't load if I pick it
89:03 - up and there you go got my icon all
89:06 - right awesome
89:07 - okay that worked that was cool
89:10 - I'm sure it was a bit anticlimactic for
89:12 - those of you who just aren't exactly
89:14 - sure what happened but let me tell you
89:15 - that was cool
89:17 - uh it's going to be a tutorial series or
89:19 - your next game this is going to be a
89:20 - tutorial on how to use unity's ugc which
89:23 - is their user generated content tool
89:26 - which is currently on open Beta recently
89:29 - researching this
89:30 - how is dinky Dev going oh it's going
89:33 - well I was doing some refactoring last
89:35 - week and now this week I'm focusing on
89:37 - making regular videos and then next week
89:39 - I'll be back to development on that and
89:42 - hopefully making a nice devot something
89:43 - like that so it should be fun
89:46 - um
89:47 - all right so basically with this I can
89:50 - use the save in order to save a thing
89:53 - okay let me just load the name as well
89:55 - even though the name doesn't actually
89:57 - show up anywhere but anyways uh so
90:00 - that's the name byte array I just really
90:03 - need to
90:04 - make this one she's actually super
90:06 - simple so how do I do it in coding dot
90:12 - unicode.getbytes get bytes of the object
90:15 - name
90:17 - that is the name byte array and then
90:19 - down here just need to add this one onto
90:22 - that one
90:24 - and finally down here so the icon byte
90:26 - list let me just increase the offset
90:30 - by this one uh
90:35 - the founder not the header uh okay so
90:38 - that gets the Sprites and then finally
90:40 - for the uh object name byte list get
90:44 - range by offset for the objects
90:47 - what record name byte array size that
90:51 - one gives me that one
90:53 - offset by down and then on this one I go
90:57 - into encoding dot Unicode get a string
91:00 - from this one dot to array so this
91:03 - Returns the string or let's just say
91:05 - object name
91:07 - and over here on the load let me do an
91:10 - outstring object name like this okay so
91:14 - now on this one a
91:16 - string that's running out out string
91:19 - object name so then when I create this
91:22 - one I give it this name
91:25 - okay now obviously I need to save it
91:27 - again let's go with my object passing
91:29 - Gamepad and so on okay let's see
91:33 - it's officially scaring where you are
91:35 - wanting like the same challenge in my
91:36 - game soon uh so far I think it has about
91:39 - uh a thousand wishlists which is a good
91:43 - enough start so as I do more and more
91:45 - Dev walks I hope that one to be
91:47 - increasing by quite a bit so the goal is
91:50 - to hit about 5000 by the launch date
91:53 - which should be at the end of July so
91:54 - essentially got two and a half months to
91:57 - get four thousand wishlist which should
91:59 - hopefully be useful for my custom avatar
92:02 - all right okay let me
92:04 - just uh
92:07 - try it out okay uh okay so
92:12 - uh what am I doing uh it's over here
92:15 - if I pick it up okay so let me exit Okay
92:18 - so this one is saving and loading now
92:19 - let's just load so just loading that one
92:22 - file
92:25 - and okay it's almost 1pm so
92:29 - almost time for me to go but I really
92:31 - wanna
92:32 - finish this part get this working okay
92:34 - so pick it up let me go into the player
92:36 - and inside the player is holding a
92:39 - kitchen object here it is the dynamic
92:42 - hello the kitchen object which has no
92:44 - name okay that's a bit annoying
92:46 - that's a bit annoying
92:49 - uh
92:51 - did I not fasten the
92:54 - other person name so why did it not
92:59 - okay
93:01 - did this load it or not that's a
93:03 - question
93:04 - so object name
93:07 - let me see this one
93:10 - uh
93:11 - right so there oh wow there are a bunch
93:13 - of custom textures well because these
93:16 - are manual so if you upload them you
93:18 - have to tell me but yeah I've validated
93:20 - them now let me just tell my tool to do
93:24 - it
93:25 - okay so it should now be updating oh
93:27 - there you go custom texture hey that
93:29 - looks nice that's a very nice suit all
93:32 - right nice thank you for drawing your
93:34 - own it's always fun when when people do
93:35 - that and get custom textures because
93:37 - some characters it's always fun so
93:39 - that's nice
93:40 - all right
93:42 - it's only 8 A.M is it so where are you
93:45 - living if it's 8 am over there I'm
93:47 - guessing you're on the east coast of the
93:49 - US I assume because over here it's 1 p.m
93:52 - so yeah
93:54 - uh right so let me see the object name
93:56 - is being loaded or not
93:58 - internally sure
94:02 - custom avatar is fun yeah
94:04 - yeah it's awesome when people use that
94:06 - feature it's a really nice tool I really
94:08 - enjoyed making it uh all right so pick
94:10 - it up that one go into that one but that
94:12 - one that one has no name that one also
94:15 - has no name okay so why don't you have a
94:17 - name
94:18 - that's my question
94:21 - [Music]
94:23 - yeah because that one did
94:26 - oh never mind well I mean obviously if I
94:29 - don't add it then it's kind of important
94:32 - so yeah sometimes I'm really a big idiot
94:36 - I guess uh yeah so anyways like this the
94:40 - name byte array.length so I have to put
94:43 - it otherwise obviously it won't actually
94:45 - save so let me go up here and now it
94:48 - should actually be saving the custom one
94:50 - all right
94:51 - hey another custom avatar hey that's
94:53 - nice here did you draw your own logo
94:55 - because that looks really cool nice gear
94:57 - icon with the angle brackets that is fun
95:00 - uh right so there you go my object and
95:03 - now if I look in the player and I
95:05 - inspect the kitchen object anyway I got
95:07 - my object all right awesome
95:08 - okay so that's cool all right
95:12 - he's important to put a game out there
95:14 - create the company talk to a lawyer I
95:16 - mean it's uh something is good to talk
95:18 - to an accountant to see how you do it
95:19 - but you can for me my Steam games I
95:22 - start off by doing a uh impression
95:26 - so that was the legal thing so you can
95:29 - uh
95:40 - foreign
95:50 - yeah you can basically start the
95:52 - business in your own name or maybe make
95:54 - a company both options are valid but I'm
95:57 - pretty much selling to an accountant
95:58 - always helps and there you go another
96:00 - Custom Care today and that's nice is
96:01 - that supposed to be the uh I always
96:03 - confuse them is it only alien or
96:05 - Predator no that's Predator okay a pixel
96:08 - art Predator that's fun
96:10 - um
96:12 - okay what was I doing okay so all these
96:14 - logs I don't really need them all of
96:16 - this is not working so that's awesome uh
96:20 - got all the bytes on the bytes the
96:23 - header size all the things okay so with
96:25 - this basically over here I am converting
96:28 - a I'm creating just one file which is
96:31 - very important which has an entire icon
96:33 - and all of the object data so that's
96:35 - good
96:38 - so
96:42 - um
96:45 - okay let me think
96:47 - um
96:51 - yeah I guess I could uh
96:56 - all right uh okay so that's good so now
96:59 - I would like to work with the actual ugc
97:02 - thing
97:04 - okay so let me basically use that one in
97:06 - order to create the mod then going to
97:09 - this one in order to actually load it
97:12 - right
97:13 - right so let me let me try it out like
97:15 - that
97:17 - so over here let me go uh
97:21 - test create contents uh
97:25 - kitchen object the cell
97:29 - so let me go into the test create
97:31 - content and over here let me try
97:34 - creating another one
97:38 - so okay
97:46 - all right so basically I'm going to open
97:48 - and for the content live stream not live
97:51 - stream my brain isn't working too well
97:53 - uh the byte save okay so so this is my
97:57 - mod file so that is what I'm going to
97:59 - want to upload it
98:04 - warning that appears on start host after
98:06 - updating doesn't stop the game
98:08 - what is the warning
98:11 - pre-files was not empty at
98:12 - initialization time
98:14 - made before initialization will be
98:17 - replaced
98:18 - I've never seen that warning
98:21 - does the code does the game Run are you
98:24 - seeing that on the end of the course
98:25 - that's a bit of a
98:27 - a strange one it seems like the network
98:29 - prefab list is not being is not being I
98:32 - don't know set correctly or it's being
98:34 - modified
98:35 - that's odd but nope I've never seen that
98:38 - error so that is strange
98:42 - I mean it's a warning so maybe it's just
98:44 - something with how the backend works
98:47 - I don't know so basically if you don't
98:49 - see any issues then I would say just
98:51 - ignore it but yeah just make sure you
98:54 - are not modifying the network prefab
98:55 - list at runtime because that would be
98:57 - the the tricky thing
99:01 - uh someone asked can you do a video on
99:03 - the live chat I've made several
99:05 - tutorials so you can go on to this page
99:07 - and over here at the bottom I've got all
99:09 - kinds of links
99:10 - so if you want to know how this works
99:12 - basically this is a Unity window so
99:14 - that's a transparent DNT window then the
99:16 - characters is their own mesh base so
99:18 - these are mesh based animations
99:20 - then for interacting with the YouTube
99:21 - API that's just an HTTP request and the
99:24 - characters how I made them these are the
99:26 - same characters that I used in my game
99:27 - battle round Tycoon so you can watch all
99:30 - these links in order to see how I built
99:32 - all this
99:33 - uh okay so let me just
99:36 - I just want to get this working and then
99:38 - I'll then I guess that won't be it
99:40 - because my voice already messed up
99:45 - okay so I go into that one
99:49 - and I'm going to upload it with whatever
99:51 - tags something
99:53 - so actually just like this it should be
99:55 - uploading so let me just go into my
99:58 - testing scene
99:59 - actually let me just save it just one
100:01 - last time because I don't think I'm not
100:04 - sure that I say this one I just run this
100:06 - just in order to save the file
100:10 - okay it did and the file is over here
100:14 - there you go 3.2 kilobytes okay so
100:16 - that's good so let me go into ah crap I
100:18 - can see the test scene all right
100:21 - let me just go into this one
100:24 - and now here
100:26 - there you go create content okay so
100:29 - that's good
100:31 - and now I think for a course Midway
100:33 - through that's nice all right
100:36 - pricing improving Effectiveness and
100:38 - self-taught programming the best advice
100:40 - is we're only just consistency so just
100:42 - focus on doing it even if it's just a
100:45 - tiny bit just do a tiny bit every single
100:47 - day that's really how you learn so that
100:49 - is much more important than trying to do
100:51 - some giant Sprints so yeah just focus on
100:54 - doing a tiny bit every single day and
100:56 - over time that will really add up so as
100:59 - some thought program it can be kind of
101:00 - hard to to uh
101:03 - decide how you're going to learn but if
101:05 - you're going through the course and
101:06 - that's awesome definitely just make sure
101:07 - you're actually learning and then keep
101:09 - at it if you get to the end you
101:11 - understand everything then you will have
101:12 - made a huge jump in your own skill set
101:14 - so definitely stick with it and hey
101:16 - Tempo another custom character hey
101:18 - thanks for being here nice yeah this was
101:20 - a bit of a random live stream on a
101:22 - random uh time so yeah bits range uh
101:25 - okay what was I doing okay so I created
101:27 - this one now if I go into my dashboard
101:31 - and I go into content and if there you
101:34 - go I do see my own okay so that one is
101:37 - public so that is fun
101:39 - all right
101:42 - oh I use this one okay I should have
101:44 - used the other one but okay that works
101:45 - anyways uh see you next time alright
101:48 - thank you for being here and see you
101:49 - next time
101:51 - um
101:52 - and if I actually download it and if I
101:54 - open it which is a bit odd
101:57 - but
101:58 - yep I can indeed see the file so it does
102:02 - have three kilobytes all right so that's
102:03 - good so basically this one created this
102:05 - so let me just store the
102:08 - the thing so a private string for the uh
102:12 - what do I call Test Kitchen chaos mod
102:16 - content ID let me just save this before
102:19 - I'll lose this
102:23 - uh okay so I got this one
102:27 - and now
102:32 - you can see Test download the subscribed
102:35 - content
102:37 - actually I don't really care about the
102:39 - Subscribe content do I no I just since
102:42 - I've got the content ID yeah I just need
102:44 - this one the download content data async
102:47 - so let me actually go on this one and
102:48 - instead of loading from a local file let
102:51 - us not do this which is obviously going
102:53 - to lead to all kinds of Errors so that's
102:55 - fine
102:56 - so I'm going to go into GCE service
103:00 - what's more this one is async uh I'm
103:03 - going to download the oh I need the
103:05 - content so that is
103:08 - oh I guess not I guess I just need this
103:13 - so I just need the content ID so let me
103:16 - actually pick this one up
103:19 - so by the way if you're used to watching
103:21 - my regular video so now you're watching
103:22 - this live stream then this code might
103:25 - seem quite dirty of these comments on
103:27 - these things and yeah that's just that's
103:29 - the perfectly normal part of the
103:31 - research process just writing things
103:33 - trying to get it working and then I
103:34 - focus on making it pretty that's pretty
103:36 - much it uh
103:38 - okay so this is going to download
103:40 - download just the content and I don't
103:42 - need the thumbnail okay so that's good
103:44 - and for downloading I think that's
103:46 - really the only thing yeah then I've got
103:48 - the downloaded content which does have a
103:50 - byte array
103:52 - okay so that's cool so wait that's on
103:54 - where that's the content dot downloaded
103:57 - content so that is a byte array so I
103:59 - just need to modify this guy which for
104:02 - some reason I need to create a class but
104:04 - that's okay
104:07 - so this one unloading instead of read
104:09 - all bytes let me receive a byte array
104:13 - so byte array and you're going to load
104:16 - that from down instead of on down so let
104:18 - me just do it by the way equals byte
104:21 - array instead of reading it you get it
104:22 - from down
104:24 - okay
104:26 - so this should be working let me just
104:28 - put the content.downloaded content like
104:31 - this
104:32 - all right no errors so let's see if this
104:35 - works that should be fun
104:38 - all right
104:41 - we wrote perfect you see usually travel
104:44 - lots of things until something clicks
104:46 - yeah that's pretty much what I'm doing
104:47 - here I mean
104:48 - if you re-watch this live stream which
104:51 - I've been for almost two hours yeah it
104:54 - took quite some time to figure out how
104:55 - to do all this saving all the data that
104:57 - I need and reloading it and then how to
105:00 - dynamically create a script more object
105:02 - so yeah this is
105:03 - pretty much how I research things I
105:04 - tried doing something little by little
105:06 - then I clean it up and then I work on
105:09 - writing the final published video so
105:11 - that's pretty much my process uh okay so
105:16 - with that one I did upload it onto there
105:19 - so now if I go where's my scenes scenes
105:23 - if I go into the game scene and now it
105:25 - should actually have that one except
105:28 - except it doesn't
105:30 - uh oh right I forgot to initialize the
105:34 - the empty services that would be
105:36 - tricking
105:37 - recommendations to make the game look
105:38 - pretty uh use good assets and definitely
105:41 - make sure you add some post-processing
105:43 - post processing can really make a huge
105:45 - difference between making your game look
105:47 - a bit middling to looking really awesome
105:49 - so yeah definitely good assets plus post
105:52 - processing that will really take your
105:54 - game visuals to the next level uh okay
105:56 - so I just need to empty auth and on let
105:59 - me just
106:00 - do this
106:03 - yeah might this user yeah that works
106:05 - fine plug in async that should be fun
106:08 - okay
106:09 - so you're starting to learn Unity that's
106:11 - nice
106:12 - how to find how to do things the right
106:14 - way I would say don't focus on
106:17 - Perfection just focus on getting things
106:19 - working learning the right way that
106:21 - comes over time so
106:24 - as long as it works right now that's
106:26 - good then oh that's loading uh but yeah
106:29 - for now focus on learning to the point
106:31 - where it actually works and then over
106:33 - time you will be able to figure out what
106:35 - exactly is the right way and look at
106:37 - that it does work so basically the thing
106:40 - over there and I can pick it up and
106:42 - there you go it does have the icon so
106:44 - this cube right here this is actually a
106:47 - custom modded kitchen object that is
106:48 - actually being downloaded from the
106:50 - internet as opposed to being over here I
106:52 - mean I've got all the assets over here
106:53 - but this one is actually it is going
106:55 - over here to the internet into the user
106:58 - generated content and on the overview
107:00 - yep I can see that I've got a download
107:03 - so in the content Yep this guy right
107:06 - here this one has been done all right
107:09 - all right awesome so that actually
107:11 - worked quite well
107:14 - if I inspect that one if I inspect the
107:17 - player the player the uh oh the player
107:20 - isn't holding it let me pick it up
107:24 - where's the player the player the hold
107:26 - point is holding a q which is holding a
107:28 - kitchen object which is downloading the
107:30 - Sprite from the internet and the my
107:31 - object name all right why not use the
107:34 - dresser bones uh because for this time I
107:37 - want player modding not just a developer
107:41 - made modding so that's the big
107:43 - difference between addressables and the
107:46 - the um
107:47 - uh empty user generate content which is
107:50 - a really interesting tool
107:52 - all right okay so basically I wanted to
107:54 - get this working and most of it is
107:56 - working I just need to still work on the
107:58 - how do I actually synchronize the fbx
108:01 - file or the obj the mesh that is going
108:04 - to be a bit tricky
108:07 - so you know
108:09 - swish your multiplayer course with Steam
108:11 - not the industry Services I mean most of
108:13 - it you can
108:15 - uh the the core of it net code for game
108:18 - object that one is independent of
108:19 - whatever platform you choose so easily
108:22 - four seem the only thing you need to
108:23 - change is use the same relay instead of
108:25 - the empty relay beyond that everything
108:28 - is exactly the same so yeah
108:31 - thanks for everything you've done in
108:33 - your channel oh that's awesome see I
108:35 - really appreciate it oh thank you thank
108:36 - you for being here thanks for watching
108:38 - the videos the videos only exist because
108:40 - I make them and because all of you watch
108:42 - them so yeah thank you all for for being
108:45 - here how to make games safe from hacking
108:47 - uh for the most part you can't I mean
108:50 - just look at popular games like Call of
108:52 - Duty they've got billions and billions
108:54 - of dollars and they cannot defeat
108:55 - hacking so for you as an indie Dev I
108:58 - would say don't worry about it just
108:59 - people are going to crack your game
109:01 - they're going to do something so unless
109:04 - you are working on multiplayer game if
109:06 - you're making something single player
109:07 - then I would say don't bother about it
109:10 - it's very good is it because I'm
109:12 - actually pre-sick so I'm a bit messed up
109:14 - but okay
109:19 - all right
109:20 - uh okay so
109:22 - I think that's gonna be it
109:24 - it's been two hours it's 1 pm so my dogs
109:27 - are already wanting some food
109:30 - so yeah okay
109:33 - between what's the difference between
109:34 - Steam and empty really uh there's really
109:36 - no difference they both do the exact
109:38 - same thing so yeah just using different
109:41 - tools but yeah
109:42 - uh okay all right so I think that's
109:45 - gonna be it
109:47 - thankfully this was a productive thing
109:49 - so I was able to dynamically generate a
109:52 - new kitchen object generate a new recipe
109:54 - deliver that recipe I was able to
109:57 - convert that into a single file and
110:00 - upload that file onto user generated
110:03 - content and I was able to download it
110:04 - and load it in here so yeah that was a
110:07 - good research stream so yeah right
110:11 - all right so yeah my voice messed up so
110:13 - that's gonna be it so
110:15 - let me just set everything up put up the
110:18 - background and all right okay
