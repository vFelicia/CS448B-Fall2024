00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your kudmaki and
00:03 - lately YouTube and Twitter feeds are
00:04 - full of Chachi PT if you haven't heard
00:07 - about it this is the latest tool
00:08 - developed by openai so these are the
00:10 - same people that built dally a while ago
00:12 - as well as gpt3 this latest one chat GPT
00:15 - is basically an AI where you can chat
00:17 - with it and it's extremely good in
00:18 - generating a great response you can just
00:21 - chat with it you can ask a bunch of
00:22 - questions and the thing that has a lot
00:24 - of people both hyped and scared is that
00:26 - you can even ask it to write code and it
00:28 - does the code that it generates is valid
00:30 - most the time and not only is it valid
00:32 - but it comes with some nice comments and
00:34 - also some mini documentation it even
00:36 - works on various languages you can write
00:39 - python c-sharp JavaScript and a bunch
00:41 - more so all in all it's really
00:42 - impressive although of course with such
00:44 - an impressive tool there's a bunch of
00:46 - people questioning so does this mean
00:47 - that programmers are on about to lose
00:49 - their jobs and since this AI works for
00:51 - generating valid Unity c-sharp code
00:53 - should you use this code directly in
00:55 - your games the results are truly amazing
00:57 - there's an excellent Channel called Nick
00:59 - chat it's a great Channel if you want to
01:02 - follow c-sharp outside of game
01:03 - development he made a video pretty much
01:05 - gushing about the power of Chachi PT and
01:08 - I definitely do share his amazement it's
01:10 - really impressive what this AI can do
01:12 - journals also try that out and post on
01:14 - Twitter how he was so impressed with it
01:15 - you can see how it works for generating
01:17 - valid Unity scripts however when it
01:19 - comes to the question is this AI going
01:21 - to take all of our jobs for that I would
01:23 - confidently say the answer is no
01:24 - programming isn't really about writing
01:27 - code it's all about problem solving the
01:29 - AI only produces a good output if you
01:32 - know the right questions to ask it's
01:34 - just like beginners to game development
01:35 - do think I want to make a huge MMORPG
01:37 - where do I start even if the AI were
01:40 - capable of building a full MMORPG you
01:42 - would still need to ask it the right
01:43 - questions and knowing exactly what
01:45 - questions to ask is exactly what a good
01:47 - program is all about a great example is
01:50 - on that same video that I mentioned in
01:52 - there Nick is very good at asking the
01:54 - exact right questions and he's also very
01:56 - good at reading the code that it
01:58 - produces and identifying the potential
02:00 - flaws which you can then help the AI
02:02 - solve by asking some follow-up questions
02:05 - so because he is very knowledgeable he
02:07 - is capable of using the AI to get work
02:09 - results a complete beginner with no
02:11 - concept of programming would not be able
02:13 - to get good results because they would
02:15 - not know exactly what to ask and how to
02:17 - structure the question so based on this
02:19 - based on the fact that programming is
02:21 - not really about writing code but rather
02:22 - about problem solving based on that I
02:24 - would say no the AI is not going to take
02:26 - all of our jobs now to answer the second
02:29 - question since this AI is so good and
02:31 - capable of generating validity C sharp
02:33 - code should you use it directly in your
02:35 - games and to that the answer is also no
02:37 - at least not directly like I said it
02:40 - does work it's really impressive and one
02:42 - of the great things is how it works
02:43 - based on knowledge that you told it
02:45 - previously so for my very first prompt I
02:48 - can just ask what is unity
02:51 - and if there go it doesn't understand
02:52 - exactly what I was asking about
02:56 - so now I can ask follow-up questions and
02:57 - I don't even have to input that it's
02:59 - c-sharp or Unity it knows that by
03:01 - default so I can ask it for example to
03:03 - make a simple movement script so make a
03:06 - simple movement script
03:10 - and yep there you go the AI is indeed
03:12 - writing a bunch of valid code
03:16 - and look at that this is a great output
03:18 - so it's got a movement script and on
03:20 - update it gets the input and it modifies
03:22 - the transform position it's got some
03:24 - nice comments telling you exactly what
03:25 - the code is doing and down here A bunch
03:27 - of mini documentation although you can
03:29 - also see how it got a bit confused at a
03:32 - point down here it says correctly that
03:33 - the script runs on the update and it
03:36 - works by moving the transform position
03:37 - directly so if you want to move the
03:39 - object with physics you've got to use a
03:41 - different approach but up here it also
03:43 - says that the object needs to have a
03:44 - rigid body component so it's kind of
03:47 - contradicting itself but the code is
03:49 - valid so let's copy this code and over
03:51 - here let's just make easy sharp script
03:53 - now just paste the whole thing there it
03:55 - is let's make a new game object let's
03:58 - put it on zero zero attach the script
04:00 - just add a nice visual
04:05 - and okay let's test and yep look at that
04:07 - it does work so I can move with the keys
04:09 - and I can indeed move my player so here
04:12 - we do have a valid movement script so
04:14 - This truly is very impressive let's see
04:16 - an even more advanced example so let's
04:18 - only to make a system to interact with
04:21 - NPCs
04:23 - let's see what it does
04:26 - all right it's writing a bunch of code
04:29 - it's getting an interaction distance
04:31 - it's testing for a button input then
04:33 - it's doing an overlap sphere to find the
04:35 - con letters
04:37 - then it tests the tag gets an NPC
04:39 - component and does some kind of interact
04:41 - method then for documentation
04:45 - and yeah potential script to an object
04:47 - in your scene with the NPC tags it uses
04:49 - a sphere overlap and calls the interact
04:51 - method on the NPC script component so
04:53 - yeah this would be a valid approach so
04:55 - as you can see this is all insanely
04:57 - impressive so if it is so impressive now
05:00 - why do I say that you shouldn't use this
05:01 - code directly well that's because the AI
05:03 - actually has one pretty big flow it's
05:06 - all based on how it actually works so
05:08 - this is all based on machine learning
05:09 - meaning they fetted a ton of data to
05:11 - generate the model so the an learned
05:14 - from a ton of public sources and it
05:16 - turns out that most of the published
05:17 - tutorials are beginner tutorials those
05:20 - are the ones I get the most likes so
05:21 - that's the kind of content that exists
05:23 - the most and most beginner tutorials
05:25 - don't necessarily teach good practices
05:26 - my personal pet peeve that you probably
05:29 - already know about is how every beginner
05:31 - tutorial teaches you how to make every
05:32 - single film public
05:34 - I made an entire video on that topic and
05:36 - why you should not make everything
05:37 - public now I understand why they do it
05:39 - on beginner tutorials it's so that
05:41 - beginners don't get frustrated with too
05:43 - much complexity by having to learn about
05:45 - access modifiers or what is a serialized
05:47 - field another example which is a hormone
05:50 - practice are tags that's another thing
05:52 - that you probably should not use in a
05:54 - proper game but lots of beginner
05:55 - tutorials teach it because it is easy to
05:57 - teach and you can see how the code that
06:00 - the ad generates has all of those bad
06:01 - practices you can see how it made the
06:03 - interaction distance public you can see
06:05 - how the void update doesn't have the
06:07 - private access modifier you can see how
06:09 - down here it's using tags and it's using
06:11 - a string to identify the NPC you can see
06:13 - that it uses non-layer mask and so on
06:15 - you can go watch my video tutorial on
06:17 - making an NPC interaction system and
06:19 - compare my code with this one generated
06:21 - by the AI you don't see how the AI code
06:23 - does work but it's also very quick and
06:25 - dirty and not really a proper good
06:26 - implementation of a proper interact
06:28 - system now what I do find funny is that
06:30 - over here if you're trying to ask it
06:32 - should you make everything public
06:41 - and look at that it does give you the
06:43 - correct
06:44 - no you should not make everything public
06:46 - making variables public allows other
06:48 - scripts to access and modify them which
06:50 - can lead to unexpected behavior and
06:52 - difficult to debug issues yep that is
06:54 - indeed correct instead you should only
06:56 - make variables and methods public if
06:58 - they need to be accessed or Modified by
06:59 - other script in most cases you should be
07:01 - using the private access modifier
07:03 - instead so it is funny that the AI does
07:05 - generate code but then also kind of
07:07 - answers in an opposite manner one thing
07:10 - that I've seen other people say is how
07:12 - the AI is very confident in its answers
07:14 - so that can mean that it is confidently
07:16 - correct or also confidently incorrect
07:19 - let's see what it does if I ask it
07:21 - should you use tags
07:29 - and look at that like I said it does
07:31 - give you a very confident answer but one
07:33 - that I would say is definitely incorrect
07:35 - it says yes you should use tags tags can
07:38 - be used to quickly identify and group
07:40 - objects based on their purpose or other
07:41 - characteristics technically that is true
07:43 - they can be used for that but they are
07:45 - horrible tool to be used for that it
07:47 - even says using tags can make your code
07:49 - more efficient text searching actually
07:51 - goes through every single game object so
07:53 - it is the exact opposite of efficient so
07:55 - if you ask it questions it won't be very
07:57 - confident in the answer but that answer
07:58 - might or might not be correct now with
08:00 - all that said one I would not recommend
08:02 - that you just blindly copy paste code
08:04 - directly into your game
08:05 - this is still an excellent tool for
08:07 - asking questions and possibly getting
08:09 - you on the right track for example
08:10 - instead of asking a question on stack
08:12 - Overflow or Unity answers you can ask
08:14 - this Ai and it might point you in the
08:16 - right direction especially when it comes
08:17 - to topics that are really beginner level
08:19 - for those it can be really useful for
08:22 - example how to test if a character is
08:25 - grounded
08:35 - and look at that it gives you the answer
08:37 - it tells you to use a physics raycast
08:39 - pointing downward from the character's
08:41 - feet if it hits the ground that means
08:43 - the character is standing on the ground
08:44 - and therefore is grounded and here's an
08:46 - example script so yep you can see this
08:48 - is indeed a valid thing now personally
08:50 - instead of a raycast I would use either
08:51 - a boxcast or a capsule cast then instead
08:54 - of making these films public I would
08:55 - probably make them serialize film
08:57 - private so I wouldn't necessarily call
08:59 - this production Ray code but it is
09:00 - definitely useful if you were a beginner
09:02 - and you asked this question this would
09:04 - definitely point you in the right
09:04 - direction and also the way that it
09:06 - outputs some nice comments and down here
09:08 - some mini documentation this makes it
09:10 - really helpful for learning so all in
09:12 - all this is an excellent tool definitely
09:14 - go ahead and give it a try but don't
09:16 - just blindly copy paste some code and
09:19 - also don't really worry about it taking
09:20 - over your job as long as you focus on
09:23 - leveling up your own software
09:24 - engineering and problem solving skills
09:26 - as long as you do that you will now be
09:28 - replaced by AI if you think different
09:30 - then go ahead post it in comment I'd
09:32 - love to hear what you all think about
09:33 - this genuinely very impressive
09:34 - technology alright hope that's useful
09:37 - check out these videos to learn some
09:38 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
09:40 - supporters for making these videos
09:42 - possible thank you for watching and I'll
09:44 - see you next time
