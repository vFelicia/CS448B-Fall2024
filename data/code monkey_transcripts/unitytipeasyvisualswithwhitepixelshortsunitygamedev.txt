00:00 - here's a quick unity tip if you create a
00:02 - sprite renderer you can actually see
00:04 - something
00:04 - so one super useful tip is to always
00:06 - have a texture of a single white pixel
00:08 - this is literally just a one by one
00:10 - texture that you can make in any program
00:12 - like paint or photoshop
00:14 - on the texture import settings set the
00:15 - pixel spray into one so it matches
00:17 - perfectly
00:18 - then you can apply the sprite onto the
00:20 - spread printer and now it does show up
00:21 - and since it's a white pixel you can
00:23 - even tint it in any color
00:25 - this is super useful for when you want a
00:27 - solid color rectangular shape like
00:29 - making some temporary
00:30 - walls alright hope that's useful
