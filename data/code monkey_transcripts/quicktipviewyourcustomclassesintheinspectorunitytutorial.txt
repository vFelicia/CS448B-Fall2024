00:02 - hi there this is a quick tip for how to
00:04 - show custom classes in the editor so
00:07 - let's say I want to set up an array of
00:08 - enemies to spawn and I want to set that
00:10 - array in the editor I could just have
00:13 - three separate arrays like I have in
00:15 - here and as you can see all three of
00:16 - them are there and now I can move around
00:18 - my scene and set my valance here in the
00:21 - code it is set up like this however this
00:24 - is obviously not a good idea we have
00:26 - data that is supposed to be connected
00:28 - but it's split over multiple arrays we
00:30 - could easily get an error if one of
00:31 - these arrays is a different size than
00:33 - the others or if we just put a value in
00:35 - the incorrect index so naturally what we
00:38 - should do since all of this information
00:40 - is meant to be connected is create a
00:42 - class or a struct to handle each
00:44 - specific spawn info so in here we define
00:46 - a private class and we're going to call
00:49 - this a spawn info and now up in here
00:51 - we're going to have each individual
00:53 - field for what we need instead of having
00:59 - all these arrays we should replace all
01:01 - these with an array of spawn info so
01:06 - just like that we have our data
01:07 - correctly grouped however in doing this
01:10 - if we go back into the editor as you can
01:13 - see nothing appears this is because the
01:16 - editor only shows the default data types
01:18 - but we can go back to our code and in
01:21 - here on our private class we're going to
01:23 - add the attribute serializable which is
01:28 - inside the using system namespace when
01:30 - we apply this attribute to a custom
01:33 - class we can now go back into the editor
01:34 - and yep there's our spawn info array
01:37 - since our class has been serializable so
01:40 - now I set the size of one there you go
01:42 - an element and yep it contains all the
01:44 - information in my spawn info so now I
01:46 - can add as many elements as I want and
01:49 - now they are correctly set up element 0
01:51 - has this position the South must read
01:53 - and so on so the data that we need is
01:55 - now grouped logically and again our
01:58 - array is private and serializable
02:00 - instead of being public and that's it
02:02 - hope you found this tip useful alright
02:04 - see you next time
