00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your kmy so after
00:02 - so long it finally happened we finally
00:04 - have a look at GTA 6 possibly the most
00:06 - anticipated game of all time as usual
00:08 - Rockstar trailers are full of tiny
00:10 - details I went through the trailer frame
00:12 - by frame and here's what I saw do you
00:14 - know why you're here bad luck I guess
00:16 - right away the most impressive shot of
00:17 - the trailer for me is this one right
00:19 - here most people probably can't even
00:20 - tell why this is so impressive
00:22 - essentially we finally have realtime
00:24 - hair physics this is something that has
00:26 - been a holy grail for quite a long time
00:29 - that's why game characters usually have
00:30 - short hair or it's all tied up it's
00:32 - because hair physics is insanely
00:34 - difficult and in this one and various
00:35 - other shots we can definitely see how
00:37 - that is definitely something they are
00:38 - focusing on it's really awesome to see
00:40 - that machines nowadays finally have
00:41 - enough power to render this in real time
00:43 - as far as I know GTA always uses in
00:45 - engine real time cut scenes as far as I
00:47 - know they're not pre-rendered so this
00:49 - appears to be runtime if it was
00:51 - pre-rendered then I'm guessing they
00:52 - would easily erase all of this aling so
00:55 - the fact that it looks really awesome
00:56 - but not perfect that leads me to believe
00:58 - this is definitely real time which is an
00:59 - insane achievement obviously the
01:01 - question is how many characters will
01:02 - have this kind of hair system whatever
01:04 - performance optimization they did it
01:06 - still a very expensive thing to do so I
01:08 - would assume only a handful of
01:09 - characters are actually going to have
01:10 - some hair like this another great piece
01:12 - of tack is this part right here it's
01:14 - really subtle but you can definitely see
01:15 - it right here if you look you can see
01:17 - that these buildings actually have some
01:19 - Interiors so this is an technique called
01:21 - interior mapping famously used by
01:23 - Spider-Man in order to make the
01:24 - buildings feel much more lived in in
01:27 - reality there's no geometry this just a
01:28 - really nice shaded trick if you want to
01:30 - know how that works the channel gev
01:32 - guide has an excellent tutorial on
01:33 - making this effect something also really
01:35 - impressive is the different shape of all
01:37 - the various NPCs they are all pretty
01:39 - much unique in this shot the main thing
01:41 - you can see is how all the NPCs they all
01:43 - seem to have very different body shapes
01:45 - this is something you can build yourself
01:46 - using some blend shapes there are some
01:48 - assets that come with characters with
01:49 - blend shapes these usually have some
01:51 - kind of sled that you can modify all
01:53 - kinds of various body parts something
01:55 - also extremely impressive are the water
01:56 - physics making some gorgeous looking
01:58 - water just like this one is really
02:00 - difficult there are all kinds of tiny
02:01 - details that make this look so good
02:03 - there's all kinds of foam all kinds of
02:04 - ripples tons of noise Maps slapped on
02:06 - top of one another not to mention all
02:08 - the CICS and how the light refraction
02:10 - changes based on being underwater if you
02:12 - want to learn about that Acera has an
02:14 - excellent video on that topic then I
02:16 - also went through the trailer frame by
02:17 - frame in order to see if they are
02:19 - reusing R Trace Reflections or not and
02:21 - in this shot right here that does appear
02:23 - to be the case right here as the truck
02:25 - goes by there's literally just one frame
02:27 - where we can see it right there there's
02:29 - a puddle on the floor and the truck is
02:31 - actually blocking the top of the gas
02:32 - station but we can still see it in
02:34 - reflection so this does imply something
02:36 - like R Trace Reflections as opposed to
02:37 - some like screen space if it was screen
02:39 - space we wouldn't be able to see this if
02:41 - the truck was blocking it also shown
02:42 - throughout pretty much the entire
02:43 - trailer is the gorgeous lighting the
02:45 - game really looks extremely beautiful we
02:48 - can see some really gorgeous volumetric
02:49 - lighting especially over here on this
02:51 - shot then on this shot of the alligator
02:53 - going inside this store we can see some
02:55 - really high quality indirect lighting
02:57 - now that leads to some speculation are
02:58 - they using some system kind of like
03:00 - Lumen if I had to guess I would say
03:02 - probably not I would say they're
03:03 - probably using something similar to
03:04 - unity's Adaptive proo volumes the reason
03:07 - why I say that is because the game
03:08 - already looks so good and literally
03:10 - everything else that I really don't
03:12 - think they have the frame budget to do
03:13 - something really intense like Lumen
03:15 - Lumen does look gorgeous but being in
03:16 - real time that makes it extremely
03:18 - performance intensive whereas baked
03:20 - lights that is something that is a tried
03:22 - and- true method on this drifting shot
03:24 - right here we can also see some really
03:26 - nice volumetric fog note how the light
03:28 - actually impacts the fog in different
03:29 - ways so the fog has actual volume it's
03:31 - not just a billboard on this chart we
03:33 - see what appears to be some kind of car
03:35 - meet and we see lots of customization on
03:37 - the cars this definitely one of those
03:38 - fan favorite features so I really hope
03:40 - this is really car modding if you want
03:42 - to learn how to do something like that
03:43 - you can see pretty much the same logic
03:45 - in my character customization video or
03:47 - perhaps even my weapon attachment video
03:49 - moding a car or weapon is really the
03:51 - same thing speaking of characters
03:52 - there's also this shot with this
03:54 - character with ton of tattoos now this
03:56 - character doesn't seem to be insanely
03:57 - hod Delan like the two main characters
04:00 - so this leads me to believe that this is
04:01 - some kind of custom character I would
04:03 - assume from some kind of GTA 6 online
04:05 - mode so that will probably have
04:07 - extensive character customization
04:09 - including I'm assuming all of these
04:11 - unique tattoos one fun way to enable
04:13 - pretty much some infinite customization
04:15 - is to allow the player to actually draw
04:16 - some tattoos it would be fun if they had
04:18 - a system like that you could build
04:20 - something like it like I covered in the
04:21 - Rover mechanic simulator video where it
04:23 - can basically paint directly on top of a
04:25 - texture we can also see all kinds of
04:27 - post rting facts throughout the entire
04:28 - trailer in this intro shot right here we
04:30 - see a nice effect right behind the glass
04:33 - so it's just a simple see-through Shader
04:35 - I did something kind of like this in my
04:36 - zoom Shader effect there's also some
04:38 - nice depth of feel post ressing here how
04:41 - the cars are all fully focused and the
04:43 - background is all unfocused and on this
04:45 - shot with a bunch of mod we can see as
04:47 - the girl moves in towards the camera
04:48 - that it actually changes the focus I
04:50 - wonder if this is just a cut scene or if
04:52 - the actual in-game effect also has some
04:54 - kind of autofocus mechanic another very
04:56 - subtle thing is right here on this shot
04:58 - we can see the plain exhaust this one
05:00 - actually applies some Distortion to the
05:01 - background again this is really all
05:03 - about these super tiny details but when
05:04 - you put them all together everything
05:06 - looks excellent speaking of tiny details
05:08 - as this character jumps on that table
05:09 - note how the bottom actually break right
05:12 - here as this bottom falls to the ground
05:14 - it really looks like as soon as it hits
05:16 - it suddenly turns into multiple pieces
05:18 - if you want to learn how to do this
05:19 - actually cover the simple destruction
05:21 - system it's actually pretty simple you
05:22 - pretty much just slice a mesh and then
05:24 - as soon as it touches the floor as soon
05:25 - as you want to break it as soon as it
05:27 - does you simply just spawn the prefab
05:28 - with the mesh split into multiple parts
05:31 - then another tiny effect is simply as
05:32 - the car is flipping around really fast
05:34 - you can see how the leaves actually blow
05:36 - over again it's all these details that
05:38 - really make a huge difference that's
05:40 - pretty much my takea away from watching
05:41 - this entire thing just the insane amount
05:43 - of detail personally I think red that
05:45 - Redemption 2 is the most detailed most
05:47 - technologically impressive game that
05:48 - I've ever seen and this one is
05:49 - definitely up there definitely in the
05:51 - same level of quality just looking at
05:53 - the scale over here of this opening shot
05:55 - just this part alone is really insanely
05:57 - impressive I mean just look at the
05:58 - amount of buildings over over there on
05:59 - the background the amount of foliage
06:01 - over here and even the amount of NPCs
06:04 - and just regular objects on here on the
06:05 - beach just on this scene there's an
06:07 - insane amount of polygons insane amount
06:09 - of detail and density and what's perhaps
06:11 - even more impressive is how all this is
06:13 - apparently running on current gen
06:14 - devices meaning the Xbox series X and
06:17 - the PS5 strangely enough there's no
06:19 - mention of PC for that I'm guessing
06:21 - they're actually going to do the same
06:22 - thing that they did with GTA5 which is
06:24 - first release on consoles and then
06:26 - basically one year after release an
06:27 - addition on PC some people will
06:29 - definitely end up buying two copies so
06:31 - that's an easy way for them to sell even
06:32 - more copies I mean that's a pretty big
06:34 - part on how GTA 5 is one of the most
06:36 - successful games of all time out of
06:38 - those 150 million copies chances are at
06:40 - least a couple million were people that
06:42 - bought it for the second or even third
06:43 - time the end screen was a bit surprising
06:45 - with saying coming in 2025 my initial
06:48 - thought was the end of 2025 cuz big
06:50 - games usually tend to come out at the
06:51 - end of the year right before the
06:53 - Chistmas sales black Fridays and so on
06:55 - but looking at the parent company take
06:57 - two interactive results they're
06:58 - expecting to to make $8 billion in
07:00 - fiscal 2025 just in case you don't know
07:02 - the financial year that actually ends in
07:04 - March of 2025 so if I had to yes yep the
07:07 - release date is probably going to be
07:08 - either February or early March of 2025
07:11 - the main thing that isn't really shown
07:12 - this trailer is pretty much a straightup
07:13 - gameplay but with pretty much a year and
07:15 - a half until release chances are we're
07:17 - going to see plenty of trailers over the
07:18 - next 16
07:20 - [Music]
07:22 - months oh well look who's back so that's
07:26 - the trailer it's really crazy to think
07:27 - how it's been 10 years since GTA 5 has
07:29 - come out personally I'm always a big fan
07:31 - of all the GTA games they're pretty much
07:33 - the perfect open world games I remember
07:35 - being in middle school and playing gta1
07:37 - on the school computer that definitely
07:39 - felt magical to be able to drive and
07:41 - walk and shoot and do all kinds of
07:42 - things and it's really impressive how
07:44 - throughout all of these entries they've
07:46 - pretty much never had a bad game at
07:48 - least personally I've always enjoyed
07:49 - them and looking at this trailer looking
07:51 - at the amount of detail they put into
07:52 - these games it seems they are still very
07:54 - much pushing for the quality to the max
07:56 - so let me know what did you find most
07:58 - interesting from this TR thank you for
08:00 - watching and I'll see you next
08:02 - time
