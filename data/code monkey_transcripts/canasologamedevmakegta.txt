00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey so
00:02 - here's a question that sounds obviously
00:03 - dumb but actually has quite an
00:05 - interesting amount of nuance can an
00:06 - experienced solo Dev make GTA now your
00:08 - initial reaction might be of course not
00:11 - and the reason why you might be thinking
00:12 - that is probably because you're thinking
00:13 - about GTA 5 or 6 and for those yep the
00:16 - answer isn't obvious of course not
00:17 - however there have been many many games
00:19 - in the GTA Series so for example what
00:21 - about GTA 1 honestly I think that
00:23 - nowadays with the awesome tools that
00:25 - exist building GTA 1 is indeed doable
00:27 - nowadays by solv this was a topown game
00:30 - where you could walk around you could
00:31 - drive shoot you could interact with
00:33 - objects and do all kinds of quests it
00:34 - had some light 3D elements really just e
00:36 - buildings everything else are just flat
00:38 - Tod Sprites this is a game that came out
00:39 - in 1997 it had about a 2 and 1 half year
00:42 - death cycle also fun fact did you know
00:44 - that GTA the original name used to be
00:46 - called raceing Chase I think this is
00:47 - actually a fun tidbit of information
00:49 - specifically regards to marketing I
00:51 - generally don't think that GTA V would
00:52 - have sold 150 million copies if it was
00:54 - called racing Chase 5 but anyway so yep
00:57 - it had about a 2 and 1 half years death
00:58 - cycle it's hard to tell the team size
01:00 - there's no specific mention and looking
01:02 - at the official game credits these have
01:04 - about 80 people although not all of
01:06 - those would have been involved in the
01:07 - core game team working on this all this
01:08 - time a lot of these are actually under
01:10 - additional art additional sound and so
01:12 - on so I assume that means something like
01:14 - temporary freelance contractors so let's
01:16 - take yes and say that the core team was
01:17 - about 30 people a team of that size for
01:19 - two and a half years was definitely not
01:21 - cheap this was definitely not a bedroom
01:23 - coders game this was a multi-million
01:25 - dollar production so I guess the
01:26 - question is are the tool so much better
01:28 - nowadays 25 years after this this are
01:30 - the tools so much better nowadays that a
01:31 - solid developer can build what
01:33 - previously used to take a team of 30
01:35 - people and millions of dollars have the
01:36 - tools really improved that much can one
01:38 - person do the work at 30 and can someone
01:40 - do something for free they used to take
01:42 - millions of dollars and Y honestly I
01:43 - generally believe the answer is yes I
01:45 - mean definitely not for a beginner not
01:46 - for someone who is just getting started
01:48 - with game development of course not at
01:50 - that point really no matter how good the
01:51 - tools are if you are a complete beginner
01:53 - then even making some like fling bird
01:54 - won't be a challenge however if you are
01:56 - an experience developer kind of like
01:57 - myself I've been making games for over
01:59 - 10 years and programming for over 25 I
02:01 - believe with the tools and the asset
02:02 - that you can get nowadays with that a
02:04 - game on the scale of GTA 1 can indeed be
02:06 - done by a solo game developer now it's
02:08 - been a year since I played this game so
02:10 - I might be misremembering in terms of
02:11 - scale just how big the game was but at
02:13 - least in terms of tech building a top
02:15 - down game a 2d top down game where you
02:17 - can drive cars shoot enemies and do all
02:19 - kinds of things so you have driving
02:21 - shooting there's the cop ey The Wanted
02:23 - system the gang AI destroying a bunch of
02:26 - objects and doing all kinds of things
02:27 - all that I do believe can be done by an
02:29 - experience all developer nowadays in
02:31 - fact I would actually say that my last
02:32 - game dinky Gardians was more complex
02:33 - than that it's an automation management
02:35 - defense game it's got tons of
02:37 - Interlocking Systems and I made that
02:39 - game by myself over the course of about
02:40 - 7 months and I did that while also
02:42 - continuing to make regular videos over
02:43 - here on this channel so I was working
02:45 - kind of parttime so I do believe that a
02:46 - game on the scale of GTA 1 can
02:48 - definitely be done by a Sol Dev nowadays
02:50 - and if you still don't believe me if you
02:51 - still think that I'm crazy and I'll
02:52 - point you to a game kind of like sard
02:54 - Valley obviously this was made by an
02:56 - extremely talented developer and took
02:57 - many many years to make but it does
02:59 - showcase what to these tools can do in
03:00 - the hands of someone who is very skilled
03:02 - or perhaps for another example look at
03:04 - kenchi this is a game with a truly
03:06 - insane scope you can do pretty much
03:07 - anything and be pretty much anyone in
03:09 - this world it's an insane game in terms
03:11 - of systems and content and this was also
03:13 - made by a small developer through the
03:14 - course of about 10 years and these two
03:16 - games these are actually relatively old
03:18 - by nowadays meaning the tools keep
03:20 - improving so if these developers start
03:21 - these games nowadays it would take them
03:23 - less time to build all of this and if
03:24 - GTA 1 can be done then same thing for
03:26 - GTA London is pretty much the same game
03:28 - just with different visuals and same
03:29 - thing for GTA 2 which if I'm remembering
03:31 - correctly was pretty much just more of
03:33 - the same more of the same game visually
03:34 - it looks a lot better and has a ton more
03:36 - content but in terms of tech it is still
03:38 - roughly the same type of game so I do
03:40 - believe this is still doable by Sol Dev
03:42 - nowadays especially because nowadays not
03:43 - only do you have access to excellent
03:45 - engines kind of like in real Unity or
03:47 - gdau but you also have access to the
03:49 - assur with tons and tons of assets to
03:51 - build pretty much any game you can
03:52 - imagine so even a solid Dev like myself
03:54 - with no art skills at all I can still
03:56 - build pretty awesome 2D and 3D games
03:58 - thanks to all these assets and in fact
04:00 - my last game d Guardians it's a systems
04:01 - heavy game it's programming heavy since
04:03 - that is my main strength and then I use
04:05 - the asset story in order to bring my
04:06 - vision to life and nowadays in 2024
04:08 - there are even some awesome AI tools
04:10 - making 3D models is still a little bit
04:12 - rough but simple Sprites like GTA 1 GTA
04:14 - 2 those can definitely be generating and
04:16 - AI could also be useful in order to
04:17 - speed up the writing process to generate
04:19 - all these different quests different
04:20 - characters and so on obviously you still
04:22 - need humans in order to analyze
04:24 - everything that the a has built but for
04:26 - speeding up process that is a very
04:27 - helpful tool if you put all that
04:29 - together then I do believe that nowadays
04:30 - a soul developer can do what 25 years
04:32 - ago took a team of 30 people and
04:34 - millions of dollars and now at this
04:35 - point you might be thinking okay if
04:36 - you're so confident why don't you do it
04:38 - honestly if I had a time machine if I
04:40 - could stop time for about 6 months I
04:41 - would love to make a game kind of like
04:43 - GTA that sounds like a really fun
04:45 - project however other than time the main
04:47 - reason why I don't do that and why I
04:48 - also would not encourage you to do it
04:50 - the reason is simply because top- down
04:51 - shoot at driving games those really
04:53 - don't sell very well you can browse
04:54 - around the top down shooter tag on Steam
04:56 - and you can see how quite a lot of them
04:58 - don't really have that many reviews
04:59 - always remember that just because you
05:01 - can build something just because you put
05:02 - a ton of effort into it that does not
05:04 - mean that it won't find Commercial
05:05 - Success although if you're doing it as a
05:07 - hobby just for fun then absolutely go
05:09 - ahead and try making your own GTA so I
05:10 - would say both GTA 1 and GTA 2 those can
05:13 - definitely be done by Sol devs nowadays
05:15 - but then when it comes to GTA 3 that one
05:16 - is definitely on the edge the big jump
05:18 - in this one is obviously going from 2D
05:19 - to 3D back then this was a huge deal I
05:22 - was completely amazed when I first
05:23 - played it it really felt impossible like
05:25 - how is it possible that a game can look
05:26 - this good just the first mission doing
05:28 - the prison escape and then driving a car
05:30 - back then this felt like complete magic
05:32 - however nowadays thanks to once again
05:34 - awesome tools and assets that change
05:35 - isn't actually that drastic making a 2d
05:37 - or a 3D game is really not that
05:39 - different the main difference is in
05:40 - terms of the assets but again nowadays
05:42 - the asset s has mountains and mountains
05:44 - of really awesome assets in fact there's
05:46 - actually more 3D stuff than there is 2D
05:48 - so in terms of General game tech
05:50 - building the core game mechanics yep I
05:51 - do still believe that this one can still
05:53 - be done by solo game developer nowadays
05:55 - however GTA 3 that one also took a huge
05:56 - leap in pretty much everything outside
05:58 - the core game mechanics the world map is
06:00 - huge every character is animated all the
06:02 - cut scenes they've got animations and
06:04 - some excellent voice acting now there
06:05 - are some AI animation tools those can
06:07 - definitely help but probably not good
06:09 - enough nowadays same thing for the voice
06:10 - acting in this one I believe all the
06:12 - characters are voice acted all except
06:13 - the player but unless you are a skilled
06:15 - voice impression is you could definitely
06:16 - not do the voices for every single
06:18 - character and again on that one nowadays
06:20 - there are some AI tools that can
06:21 - definitely help they still sound quite a
06:23 - bit robotic so it still requires a few
06:24 - months maybe a few years and quite simly
06:26 - just the fact that the game is really
06:27 - massive even with the help of tons of
06:29 - awesome tools it would be really tricky
06:31 - to build this entire world and fill up
06:32 - with interesting stories interesting
06:34 - props everywhere all this at some point
06:36 - no matter how good the tools are there
06:37 - is some limit to it so in terms of the
06:38 - core game mechanics like the shooting
06:40 - the driving the various AI for the
06:42 - various things all the gangs and all
06:43 - that stuff all that I still believe
06:45 - could be done by solo Game Dev however
06:47 - in terms of building the entire game
06:48 - itself building all the story the entire
06:50 - world all of that doing all of that yeah
06:51 - that part would be impossible and then
06:53 - of course after that point becomes even
06:55 - more impossible GTA 4 is yet another
06:57 - massively forward it's got really high
06:59 - quality assets and a massive amount of
07:00 - them D is absolutely huge so even if a
07:03 - Sol Dev got access to all these assets
07:05 - it would still take you a lifetime to
07:06 - build this entire world it also has even
07:08 - more cutcenes more voice acting more
07:09 - animations all of that there's more cars
07:11 - NPCs weapons all of that then GTA 5 is
07:14 - impossible no matter how good your tools
07:15 - are this game had a team size of over a
07:17 - thousand people it's an insane game on
07:19 - an insane scale and got actually insane
07:21 - results it's literally one of the
07:23 - bestselling games of all time and in the
07:24 - future there's GTA 6 who knows how many
07:27 - people I've worked on this game probably
07:28 - several thousand throughout the entire
07:30 - decade it is supposedly one of the most
07:32 - expensive games ever made over $300
07:33 - million these games have a scale that is
07:35 - utterly impossible to even comprehend
07:37 - but going back to the original question
07:39 - can you build GTA GTA 1 GTA 2 and even
07:41 - GTA 3 I do think that with the awesome
07:43 - tools that exist nowadays and with a
07:45 - very skill developer with that yep
07:47 - projects that would require previously
07:48 - 30 people or 50 people and millions of
07:50 - dollars nowadays those same projects can
07:52 - be built by a solo developer and pretty
07:54 - much for free like I said I would not
07:56 - recommend it if you're trying to find
07:57 - financial success with your games just
07:59 - because this genre top down shooting
08:00 - games this isn't really a very
08:02 - marketable genre nowadays but as a hobby
08:04 - if you want to test on your own skills
08:05 - then perhaps go ahead and build your own
08:07 - GTA 1 and if you aren't yet an
08:09 - experienced Game Dev and you want to
08:10 - become one if so then check out my
08:12 - complete C course Link in the
08:13 - description I include my 10 years of C
08:15 - knowledge in this one course it features
08:17 - over 50 video lectures starting
08:18 - everything from the absolute basic to
08:20 - some more intermediate topics and the
08:22 - course includes a really awesome
08:23 - companion project this one contains
08:25 - questions quizzes and importantly
08:26 - interactive exercises there's over a
08:28 - hundred of them and these exercis
08:30 - required to actually write code in order
08:31 - to complete them meaning you can
08:33 - actually learn by doing this way you
08:34 - truly learn the contents of each lecture
08:36 - so if you want to level up your own
08:37 - skills and be able to build a game kind
08:39 - of like GTA if so then check the link in
08:41 - the description or for Unity beginner

08:44 - kitchen chos course that will teach you
08:45 - how to make a very specific game from
08:47 - start to finish okay so do you agree
08:48 - with my take on this question is making
08:50 - a gtn like something that you would like
08:52 - to do definitely go ahead and tell me in
