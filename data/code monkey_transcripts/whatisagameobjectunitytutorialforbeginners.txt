00:00 - hello and welcome I am your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're going to learn
00:03 - what a game object is and what it's used
00:05 - for let's begin
00:09 - so a game object is the base class for
00:12 - all entities in unity in the scene
00:15 - hierarchy in here you can create a new
00:17 - game object by right-clicking create an
00:20 - empty which creates an empty game object
00:22 - and in here in the inspector you can
00:25 - view the stats for an empty game object
00:27 - you can rename the object either
00:29 - directly in the scene hierarchy in here
00:32 - so my game object or you can also rename
00:36 - it in this textbox in here so let's name
00:38 - the subject sprite as you can see it
00:41 - updated in there okay up here you can
00:44 - choose an icon for your game object
00:46 - which will make it very easy to find in
00:48 - your scene so select an icon and as you
00:50 - can see in here in the scene the icon is
00:53 - visible and it contains the name of the
00:55 - game object if you're working in 2d make
00:58 - sure you go up here in the gizmos and
01:00 - decent like 3d icons so with the icon
01:03 - you can view the name of the game object
01:05 - and easily locate it in your scene
01:07 - window and if you go to the game view
01:10 - you can click this button here to turn
01:12 - on gizmos which one display the game
01:14 - object in your game view you can also
01:16 - give it a custom icon if you really want
01:19 - to customize your scene click on other
01:21 - and in here you can see the list of all
01:23 - the images in your project and in here
01:26 - you can see the icon of our game object
01:28 - this can be quite helpful especially
01:30 - during all level design a game object
01:33 - always has a transform component by the
01:35 - font and also has the ability to add
01:38 - more components you can for example
01:40 - click this button and add the sprite
01:43 - renderer component which gets added to
01:46 - this game object which enables you to
01:48 - display a 2d sprite you can drag a
01:51 - texture into the sprite field and now
01:55 - you can visually see the texture in-game
01:57 - this checkbox up here and lets you
01:59 - enable and disable the game object if I
02:02 - disable the game object all of its
02:04 - components get disabled so in this case
02:05 - you can see the sprite disappearing when
02:07 - I disabled the game object and
02:09 - reappearing when I enable so let's look
02:11 - into what we can do with a game object
02:13 - through code let's make a new c-sharp
02:16 - script and name it my
02:18 - game or script inside as you can see by
02:22 - the phone this class extends the omona
02:24 - behavior class and has these start and
02:26 - update functions a class must extend the
02:29 - amount of behavior in order to be used
02:31 - as a component in a game object the
02:34 - start function runs as soon as the game
02:36 - object starts and runs only once the
02:39 - update is called once per frame so in
02:42 - order to test on our start in here let's
02:44 - do a debug log game object I'll start
02:49 - debug dialog simply prints a string into
02:52 - our console so let's go in the editor
02:55 - select our game object and in here we
02:59 - can either click Add component and
03:01 - locate our script or we can simply drag
03:05 - the script on to our game object and now
03:07 - the script has been added to this game
03:09 - object okay so let's run the game so far
03:13 - as you can see in the console in here it
03:16 - is this playing game object at start
03:18 - which means our script is correctly
03:20 - executing alright so now that we have
03:22 - some code running let's try to
03:23 - dynamically create a game object so on
03:26 - our start function in here let's simply
03:28 - make new game ok let's run the code and
03:32 - see what happens as you can see in the
03:34 - hierarchy we have a new game object in
03:36 - our scene this is game object that was
03:38 - created through code
03:39 - alright now let's modify it so in here
03:42 - when constructing we can give a argument
03:44 - for the game object name so let's call
03:46 - it my new game object as you can see the
03:51 - game object has been created and has the
03:53 - name my new game object adding a custom
03:55 - name to your dynamically queried game
03:57 - object is very useful for easily finding
03:59 - it in your scene ok so now let's add a
04:01 - component through code so first let's
04:04 - story reference to the new only create a
04:06 - game object so game object my game
04:10 - object equals the new game object so
04:13 - using the reference to my game object
04:15 - let's use the function add component and
04:19 - we're going to add a component of type
04:22 - sprite renderer this will add the sprite
04:26 - renderer component to our newly created
04:28 - game object so in here as you can see we
04:31 - got the new game
04:31 - object and you can see in the inspector
04:33 - it has the transform which is only
04:35 - spawned when you create new game object
04:36 - and has the sprite renderer component
04:38 - that we just instantiate it if you
04:41 - already know what components you're
04:42 - going to need in your newly created game
04:44 - object you can add them in the
04:46 - constructor like this type of sprite
04:49 - renderer and this way is much better for
04:52 - performance and as you can see the
04:54 - result is exactly the same there it is
04:56 - sprite runner ok great so there you have
04:59 - it we covered what is a game object and
05:01 - the many ways you can modify it both in
05:03 - the editor and through code game objects
05:06 - are at the base of everything you see in
05:07 - a Unity game so by understanding them
05:10 - you can now begin to experiment with
05:11 - components by looking into the default
05:14 - ones and making your own if you have any
05:16 - questions post them in the comments and
05:17 - I'll do my best Angela subscribe for
05:19 - more videos and I'll see you next time
