00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's talk about the number one
00:04 - most important skill you need if you
00:05 - want to be a successful indie game
00:07 - developer with this skill you have a
00:09 - chance to find success and without it
00:11 - you are guaranteed to fail now i don't
00:13 - like videos where they tease the answer
00:14 - to keep you watching until the end so
00:16 - here it is the number one skill is
00:17 - marketing but do keep watching to know
00:20 - why that is the most important skill and
00:22 - in this video i'll also give you some
00:23 - helpful links on how you can start
00:25 - learning indie game marketing as well as
00:27 - some metrics for you to track and a
00:29 - checklist to follow to have the best
00:30 - chance of finding success with your
00:32 - games now if you're a game developer you
00:34 - might be upset to hear that marketing is
00:36 - the most important skill you might be
00:38 - thinking oh i really just want to make
00:40 - games i don't like working on marketing
00:42 - and i get that but regardless of how you
00:45 - feel about it this really is the most
00:47 - important skill nowadays we live in what
00:49 - is called an attention economy attention
00:51 - is really the most valuable resource
00:53 - that is why the going with platforms
00:55 - like youtube and facebook their goal is
00:57 - to keep you on the side for as long as
00:58 - possible it's because your attention has
01:00 - value it's also why a company like
01:03 - netflix says their biggest competitor is
01:05 - not movie studios but rather games like
01:06 - fortnite there's a million things
01:08 - competing for your attention and more
01:10 - importantly for the attention of your
01:11 - players marketing is simply the study of
01:14 - attention and how to get it that is why
01:16 - it's an extremely important skill that
01:17 - you absolutely need to learn now let me
01:19 - also clarify what i mean by most
01:21 - important here i'm talking in the
01:23 - context of wanting to become a
01:25 - professional indie game developer
01:27 - meaning that you want to make a living
01:28 - from making games you want to make games
01:30 - that sell internet profits so you can
01:32 - keep making more games and keep this as
01:34 - your job
01:35 - but on the other hand if your goal is to
01:37 - make games simply as a hobby just for
01:39 - fun
01:40 - then for that marketing is much less
01:42 - important but it's still pretty
01:43 - important since even if you're doing it
01:45 - as a hobby i'm guessing you still want
01:47 - people to play your games so regardless
01:49 - of your goal you're still going to need
01:50 - to attract the dungeon and as soon as
01:52 - some people hear that they should do
01:54 - marketing some people go straight into
01:55 - the default answer which is oh i don't
01:57 - worry about it a good game just sells
01:59 - itself so let me tell you right away
02:01 - that is absolutely not true the quality
02:04 - bar is really high nowadays being good
02:06 - is not good enough having a good game is
02:09 - the absolute bare minimum requirement
02:11 - there are tons of games coming out that
02:12 - are really good but without marketing
02:14 - then people simply don't know about them
02:16 - so they never sell so a great game that
02:18 - no knows about will not sell itself if
02:21 - you are a regular on this channel then
02:22 - you know i do a top 10 list of the best
02:25 - new games released every month fighting
02:27 - games for that list is pretty easy
02:29 - there's tons of awesome new games every
02:31 - single month the tricky part is really
02:33 - cutting it down to just 10
02:35 - and every time i make one of those
02:36 - videos i see tons of games that look
02:38 - really cool but have almost no sales
02:41 - for example look at this game that came
02:42 - out a few months ago it looks like a
02:44 - very well made retro shooter it's got a
02:47 - nice art style lots of effects and it's
02:49 - a relatively popular genre and the
02:51 - reviews it received are indeed positive
02:54 - so this looks like a great game
02:56 - but based on the reviews and using the
02:58 - box and lighter method which means you
03:00 - multiply the reviews by between 20 and
03:01 - 70 so around 40. with 50 reviews we can
03:05 - assume this game sold around 2 000
03:06 - copies which at this price point of 10
03:09 - means only about 10k gross revenue which
03:12 - after seems cut any refunds or
03:14 - chargebacks and taxes after all of that
03:17 - it might be just about ak net
03:19 - now maybe if the developer lives in a
03:21 - place with a really low cost of living
03:23 - or maybe if this game was made insanely
03:26 - fast in some like under 3 months in that
03:28 - case maybe it's not such a horrible
03:30 - number but regardless of that based on
03:32 - the quality of the game you would
03:33 - definitely assume a better result so the
03:35 - question is why did this one not find
03:37 - success i'm going to mention some
03:39 - metrics you can track in a bit the main
03:41 - ones being followers and wishlists
03:43 - if you go to steam to be you can see
03:45 - that this game had just 300 followers
03:47 - before release so probably only around a
03:50 - thousand wishlists
03:51 - that means very few people knew about
03:53 - the game even fewer were notified when
03:55 - the game was released and even fewer
03:57 - then picked it up which in turn means it
03:59 - was buried on steam under thousands of
04:01 - other games by the way if you're the
04:03 - developer of this game please don't take
04:04 - this the wrong way i'm not saying the
04:06 - game is banned quite the opposite from
04:08 - looking at the trailer in the reviews it
04:10 - seems like a great game and i believe
04:11 - with some good marketing it would have
04:13 - sold much much better
04:14 - and i didn't just cherry pick one
04:16 - specific game to make my point you can
04:18 - go browse the steam new releasing list
04:20 - and see for yourself just how many games
04:22 - look great but don't even have 50
04:24 - reviews and just like i mentioned in
04:26 - those top 10 new releases videos the
04:28 - reason why i do those is so i can keep
04:30 - up to date with what's coming out and
04:32 - see what is finding success
04:34 - so researching those games and doing
04:35 - those videos is a way for me personally
04:37 - to keep studying and learning about
04:39 - marketing so that my future games have a
04:41 - better chance to find success
04:42 - also another example one of the reasons
04:44 - why i started this channel was
04:46 - specifically to tackle this problem i
04:48 - was studying steam more and more and i
04:50 - learned that discoverability was really
04:51 - only getting harder and harder
04:53 - if i wanted to find success with my
04:55 - games i could not rely on steam finding
04:57 - the players for me
04:59 - steam will only help you sell your game
05:01 - if you can prove that your game can sell
05:03 - meaning that if you don't get that
05:04 - initial amount of sales then your game
05:06 - will simply be lost in a sea of
05:08 - thousands of other games but if you do
05:10 - make that initial push then c will do
05:12 - the rest if you take the effort to do
05:14 - some marketing and you get some people
05:16 - excited for your game and get them to
05:18 - pick it up on day one if you do that the
05:20 - sim algorithm will see your game is
05:22 - getting sales which in turn will promote
05:23 - it to more and more people leading to
05:25 - more and more sales so one of the
05:27 - reasons why i started this channel was
05:28 - for marketing reasons so that i could
05:30 - gather an audience by sharing my
05:32 - knowledge with some useful videos then
05:34 - hopefully that audience would pick up my
05:35 - games whenever i release them and by
05:37 - selling a bunch of copies on day one
05:39 - that would signal to the steam algorithm
05:41 - to push the game and have a successful
05:42 - launch that was my original plan however
05:45 - i must say if you're thinking of doing
05:46 - the exact same thing i would caution you
05:48 - to think about what type of audience
05:50 - you're trying to attract for me i enjoy
05:53 - learning and teaching things so i made a
05:55 - tutorial channel but it turns out that a
05:57 - game dev audience is very different from
05:59 - a game playing audience i initially
06:01 - assumed that a lot of people would
06:02 - follow my tutorials and be curious to
06:04 - know where the knowledge came from so
06:06 - they would then pick up my games to see
06:08 - them i have a bundle on the code monkey
06:10 - website but in almost 4 years and over
06:13 - 20 million views it's only sold maybe
06:14 - 500 copies and now i definitely
06:17 - understand that personally i'm more of a
06:19 - game dev than a game player and i
06:20 - definitely find that i like the time to
06:22 - actually play games so all of that to
06:24 - say be intentional about what type of
06:26 - audience you want to attract
06:28 - there are several people doing some more
06:30 - developed content and that type does
06:32 - seem to translate into sales for example
06:34 - on the top you have denny his devlogs
06:37 - are extremely entertaining they
06:38 - definitely appeal to a more general game
06:40 - playing audience and as such all these
06:42 - games have been massive hits another
06:44 - example is thin matrix he gathered an
06:46 - audience over several years making
06:48 - devlogs and when the game came out it
06:50 - sold tons of copies and then steam
06:52 - pushed it to more and more people making
06:53 - it a massive success so using youtube is
06:56 - absolutely an excellent way to do it
06:58 - just make sure you target the right
06:59 - audience with regards to how to learn
07:02 - indie game marketing here are some very
07:03 - harmful links first of all you have the
07:05 - clark tank this was a show made by ryan
07:08 - clark who runs a very successful indie
07:10 - game company that made huge hits they
07:13 - made games like crypt of the necrodancer
07:15 - and cadence of hyrule
07:16 - the clark tank was a weekly show where
07:18 - he would go through the steam charts and
07:20 - analyze why each game was doing well he
07:23 - doesn't do it anymore but you can still
07:24 - go watch the old episodes there's tons
07:26 - of excellent info there and he also made
07:28 - possibly one of the best tanks of all
07:30 - time on how to consistently make
07:32 - profitable indie games marketing is an
07:34 - extremely important part of that process
07:36 - and an excellent companion video all
07:38 - about how to analyze hooks
07:40 - i would highly highly encourage you to
07:42 - watch that video and study it marketing
07:44 - becomes much much easier if your game
07:46 - idea has a good hook
07:47 - on the other hand if your game has no
07:49 - hook or a generic hook like it's just
07:52 - another generic 2d pixel platformer in
07:55 - that case marketing becomes even more
07:56 - difficult i can also highly recommend
07:59 - the newsletter game discover co it's a
08:01 - weekly newsletter all about indie game
08:03 - marketing analyzing why some games find
08:05 - success and tons of stats on how indie
08:07 - games are selling
08:09 - another great one for marketing is chris
08:11 - tsukowski he's got a vlog with tons of
08:13 - useful articles and even some youtube
08:15 - videos where he analyzes various store
08:17 - pages
08:18 - i also made some videos myself a while
08:20 - ago on some checklists of what you
08:22 - should do before and after launching on
08:23 - scene
08:24 - lots of the things on that checklist are
08:26 - all about marketing so you can see just
08:28 - how important it is so i would encourage
08:30 - you to study all of those sources if you
08:32 - do you won't be much better off than
08:34 - most indie devs and greatly greatly
08:36 - increase your chances of finding success
08:38 - now as to how you actually do it there
08:41 - are many many ways to do marketing the
08:43 - most basic prerequisite is simply having
08:45 - a public steam page the most impactful
08:47 - thing in marketing is simply time the
08:50 - quicker you get your steam page up and
08:51 - running the more time you have to gather
08:53 - wishlists and wishlists build up over
08:55 - time so the longer you have your page
08:57 - receiving wishlist the better
08:59 - then like i mentioned a while ago one of
09:00 - the main ones is youtube if you have the
09:03 - right kind of personality you can
09:04 - attempt the danny style with lots of
09:06 - funny clips and some extreme editing as
09:09 - for me i definitely do not have that
09:10 - kind of personality so that type of
09:12 - content would definitely not work for me
09:14 - but you can also do some more chill dev
09:16 - vlogs i made a video quite a while ago
09:18 - covering a bunch of devlogs like i
09:20 - mentioned themed matrix is a good one
09:23 - you also have flow studio that recently
09:25 - released a successful game
09:27 - you have lumber mill and devdog and many
09:29 - more feel free to check those out to see
09:31 - what style best fits you and your game
09:34 - also it doesn't have to be just develops
09:36 - maybe if you have a sandbox game you
09:39 - could make a channel with some funny
09:40 - clips or some weird unexpected things
09:42 - that happen in your game remember that
09:44 - the goal is attention so do whatever you
09:46 - can do that brings in the most intention
09:48 - another place you can do some marketing
09:50 - would be on twitter although in terms of
09:52 - results i believe this one is quite
09:54 - limited
09:54 - but still you should be making some
09:56 - gifts and perhaps one of them will go
09:58 - viral
09:59 - then as you're making those gifts you
10:00 - can also post them on imager
10:03 - i think this one also has kind of lost
10:04 - its power nowadays but you might get
10:06 - lucky and make it go viral then of
10:08 - course you have reddit depending on what
10:11 - game you're making you can find a
10:12 - subreddit specific for the audience
10:14 - you're looking for
10:16 - for example there's a tycoon subreddit
10:18 - there's one for turn-based strategy or
10:20 - maybe you can even post in subreddits of
10:22 - other popular games similar to yours
10:25 - but do be careful with red rules some
10:27 - silver edits are very strict about
10:29 - self-promotion
10:30 - there's also tick tock personally i have
10:33 - not explored this one yet i'm not
10:34 - familiar with it but i did hear some
10:36 - indies are finding quite a lot of
10:38 - success
10:38 - then a tried and true method you have a
10:41 - mailing list just have a sign up form on
10:43 - your website mention it whenever you
10:45 - mention your game and keep growing that
10:47 - list
10:48 - usually people who sign up to a mailing
10:49 - list are already pre-interested so
10:51 - growing this one is very difficult but
10:53 - very powerful another technique a lot of
10:55 - people have used successfully is making
10:57 - a free prologue
10:59 - so kind of like making a free demo if
11:01 - you design the demo correctly and it
11:03 - leaves people wanting more then you will
11:05 - likely gather a nice amount of wishlist
11:07 - and related to that free prologue
11:09 - something more recent are the steam
11:10 - festivals i believe they have some rules
11:13 - on when you can submit but if you can
11:15 - definitely take advantage of it for
11:17 - example the game i mentioned a while ago
11:19 - lens island by floyd studio they
11:21 - benefited massively from participating
11:23 - in this team festival
11:24 - it's great for gathering tons and tons
11:26 - of wishlists even if those then convert
11:28 - less than the organic questions and of
11:30 - course you also have paid marketing this
11:32 - one will naturally depend on the funds
11:34 - you have available as well as the price
11:36 - of your game
11:38 - if you have a very cheap five dollar
11:40 - game it's pretty difficult to make paid
11:41 - marketing work
11:42 - but if your game is 15 or 20 dollars
11:45 - then at that point it becomes much more
11:47 - doable
11:48 - so those are just a bunch of ways you
11:49 - can do some marketing you might be
11:51 - thinking to yourself okay that sounds
11:53 - good but it's way too much work so again
11:55 - let me remind you that the alternative
11:57 - to doing no marketing is getting no
11:59 - sales
12:00 - so either you put in the work or you
12:02 - have a guaranteed failure sadly that's a
12:04 - reality whether you like it or not
12:06 - as for metrics specifically on steam
12:09 - there's some you should track like i've
12:11 - already mentioned the most important one
12:12 - is wishlists wishlists are one of the
12:15 - ways that the steam algorithm learns
12:16 - that your game is popular the more wish
12:19 - list you have at launch the more steam
12:20 - will promote your game and everyone who
12:22 - wish list will receive a notification
12:24 - when your game launches
12:26 - then the more those wishlists convert
12:28 - the more steam promotes your game
12:29 - further and further another one related
12:31 - to it are followers these are people who
12:34 - click on the follow button on your store
12:35 - page it means they will receive
12:37 - notifications of any announcements you
12:39 - post
12:40 - so followers are kind of like super
12:42 - wishlists
12:43 - as for specific numbers naturally higher
12:45 - is better you should aim for at the very
12:48 - least having around 1500 followers and 5
12:50 - 000 wishlists if you've been working on
12:53 - your game for many years and you
12:54 - generally believe in its quality and
12:56 - you're under that number in that case i
12:58 - would honestly delay the launch and
13:00 - focus hard on marketing until you
13:01 - achieve those you only get one launch
13:03 - it's nearly impossible to come back
13:05 - after a bad one there were some reports
13:07 - although i don't think they've been
13:09 - confirmed that seam has some sort of bar
13:11 - at around 10 000 wish lists meaning that
13:14 - if you get that much you will
13:15 - automatically get much more visibility
13:16 - on the lunch
13:18 - again not sure if that's a fact or just
13:20 - a rumor but regardless more is better so
13:22 - yes the number one most important skill
13:24 - if you want to be successful in the game
13:26 - developer is indeed marketing regardless
13:29 - of how you feel about that it is simply
13:30 - the reality if you refuse to do it then
13:33 - your game will most likely be a flop so
13:35 - do work hard to make your game as best
13:37 - as it can be but also work hard to
13:39 - actually tell lots of people about it
13:41 - this one is a really important topic so
13:43 - i'm really glad i made this video i'm
13:45 - happy you made it to the end and i
13:47 - really really hope this information
13:49 - helps you make your game a huge success
13:51 - now go ahead and hit the like button so
13:53 - more people can find this video and help
13:55 - those people not waste their time by
13:56 - ignoring marketing alright thank you for
