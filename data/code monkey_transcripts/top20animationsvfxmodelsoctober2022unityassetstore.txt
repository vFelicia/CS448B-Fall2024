02:30 - long as you use some excellent looking
02:32 - assets if you need some VFX here's a

03:12 - ominous looking one some sci-fi metal
03:15 - structures it reminds me of Blade Runner
03:18 - or maybe control you just had some fog
03:20 - in the looks really spooky even though
03:22 - it's literally just a bunch of super
03:24 - simple meshes if you are a VR developer
03:26 - and you need some cool looking hands

04:25 - shapes especially for the face you can
04:27 - definitely create any expression you
04:29 - want by just modifying a bunch of
04:30 - Sliders then here's a pack with a bunch
04:33 - of gorgeous Skies I've mentioned several
04:35 - times on how one of the easiest ways to
04:37 - make your game look much better is to
04:39 - just swap out the default Skybox with a
04:41 - proper gorgeous looking Skybox this one
04:43 - is pretty cheap and comes with 5 Skybox
04:45 - sectors all of them look really great
04:47 - and this dev has a whole bunch more if
04:49 - you're looking for something you want a
04:50 - more realistic art style next is an
04:53 - interesting pack for creating modular
04:54 - guns basically you have a ton of
04:57 - separated weapon body parts all of them
04:59 - look around the 30s or 50s definitely an
05:02 - interesting pack if you have some idea
05:03 - based on randomly generated guns then
05:06 - here's a great looking cartoony Suburban
05:08 - City looks very anime like it has that
05:11 - specific sound it's a pretty large city

05:17 - really nice Magic Shield bubbles all of
05:19 - them are really high quality they've got
05:21 - all kinds of minor effects that really

05:28 - and effects for you to make some Buffs
05:29 - or debuffs next up here is a humanoid
05:32 - animal it's a pretty nice model I think

05:36 - nice outfit so maybe this one could be
05:38 - your player character and if you like
05:40 - this style then this dev has a whole
05:42 - bunch more then if you need some

06:11 - game is hacker inspired if so here's an
06:14 - office that looks straight out of a
06:15 - movie this one is the exact opposite of
06:17 - how I work for me I like tons of lights
06:19 - and light mode on all my windows if I
06:22 - lived in this place I would go blind
06:23 - pretty much instantly but it certainly
06:25 - has a very unique style so if this is is
