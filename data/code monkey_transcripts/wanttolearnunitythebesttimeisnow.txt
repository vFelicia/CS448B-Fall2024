00:43 - player and player prefs but more than
00:45 - that you can also learn about things
00:47 - that you probably didn't even know
00:48 - existed so things like assembly
00:50 - definition pivot center and local global
00:52 - learn about script execution order and
00:55 - legacy versus mechanim animations
00:57 - and also learn about things that are too
00:59 - small to be covered in a youtube video
