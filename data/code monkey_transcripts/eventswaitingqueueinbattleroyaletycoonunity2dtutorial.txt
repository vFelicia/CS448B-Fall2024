00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're continuing to
00:03 - create the waiting queue in bar morale
00:05 - tycoon we're going to add some events to
00:07 - our cutes
00:08 - so we can later notify the building when
00:10 - a guest is waiting in front let's get
00:12 - started
00:15 - so in the previous video we created the
00:18 - waiting queue in here we have an
00:19 - entrance position and five Q positions I
00:22 - have two buttons in here one to add yes
00:25 - to the queue that when I click on it I
00:28 - guess well come into the entrance
00:30 - position and move towards his own
00:32 - position on the queue and I have a get
00:35 - guest button that sends the guests
00:37 - waiting in front away when I have
00:39 - multiple guests in my queue and I get
00:41 - the first one the others get
00:42 - repositioned in front okay good the game
00:45 - is still in development so if you like
00:47 - the concept get a steam page add to your
00:49 - wish list and follow alright so before
00:52 - we can create the building logic we need
00:54 - to add some events to our queue
00:55 - something that won't notify the building
00:57 - that I guess is ready to enter so first
00:59 - of all let's make it automatic to have
01:01 - the guests enter the queue here in our
01:03 - game handler let's first comment out the
01:05 - add guests button and let's make it
01:08 - automatic by creating a function
01:10 - periodic which is part of the code
01:14 - monkey table utils which is always you
01:17 - can wear out for free from unity code
01:18 - monkey comm going to go in here and
01:21 - create a function periodic a function
01:24 - periodic is just a function which is
01:27 - triggered after some time so this action
01:30 - won't be executed every second and here
01:34 - let's put the code that we had on our
01:36 - button so essentially now we no longer
01:38 - need to click the button automatically
01:40 - every second it won't check if it can't
01:42 - add a guest to the queue you won't grab
01:44 - a guess that is idle and add it to the
01:46 - queue now let's go into the CM debug
01:49 - class and create a text pop-up saying
01:54 - add guest on a position there on the
01:58 - side so this way we can easily visualize
02:01 - when this function is triggered and when
02:03 - a guest is added to the queue okay so
02:06 - let's test and we should see the guests
02:08 - automatically enter and see pop-ups when
02:10 - one is added okay here I am and as you
02:13 - can see the events are firing DSR being
02:15 - added automatically there's the first
02:17 - one so you learn and so on and I can
02:20 - grab one and then fires again okay so
02:22 - every time I grab a guest he
02:24 - automatically adds okay good
02:26 - okay so in order to have our building
02:28 - request guests we
02:29 - to be notified when a guest reaches the
02:31 - front of the queue let's make that using
02:34 - an event we're going to go into our
02:36 - waiting queue and up here I'm going to
02:39 - create a public event event handler
02:42 - which is part of the system namespace
02:45 - public event event handler and call it
02:48 - on guest arrive at front of queue this
02:53 - will be triggered when a guest arrives
02:54 - at the front the key of course
02:55 - so in here when I'm moving my guest the
02:57 - move to function has an action which is
03:00 - triggered when they arrive at their
03:01 - position so when the guests arrive their
03:03 - position let's call a function and name
03:05 - it just arrived at queue position and it
03:10 - will receive this guest as a parameter
03:13 - so this is the action that will trigger
03:16 - when the guest arrives at that position
03:18 - now for this function let's go up here
03:21 - make a private void and it's going to
03:23 - receive a guest object and we're going
03:27 - to trigger the same thing down here when
03:30 - we're locating all of our guests okay so
03:32 - now I have this function being combed
03:33 - every time a guest arrives at a certain
03:35 - position now we have to figure out if
03:37 - that position is the one in front so as
03:40 - we know from up here the guest list the
03:42 - index in this list is the same as the
03:44 - position list so if the guest is that
03:46 - guest list zero then we know he arrived
03:49 - at the first position so if the guest
03:52 - equals guests with zero so this guest is
03:57 - a guest that is in front then that means
03:59 - the guest in front has reached the front
04:01 - of the queue so let's trigger our event
04:03 - go up here and it's the on guess arrived
04:05 - so if the event is not known so if we
04:09 - have subscribers to this event we're
04:11 - going to trigger the event with event
04:14 - archive empty and in here we need to
04:17 - actually store a reference to our guest
04:19 - guest list I and that's what we're going
04:23 - to use to send them to move and to send
04:25 - the reference okay so every time we move
04:28 - our guests we are triggering this
04:30 - function when the guest arrives at his
04:32 - target position then here we're testing
04:34 - if the guests arrived today's position
04:36 - is the first guest if it is then he
04:38 - arrived at the front of the queue and we
04:39 - fire our event now let's go back into
04:42 - our game handler
04:43 - we're going to subscribe to this event
04:45 - so going to the waiting queue to the on
04:48 - guest arrive at the front of the queue
04:50 - and let's subscribe to this event in
04:53 - here in order to visualize the event
04:55 - let's spawn a pop-up like we did up here
04:59 - make it say on yes right okay yeah
05:02 - exactly put it somewhere on the right
05:04 - side okay so now our guest should be
05:06 - automatically entering the queue moving
05:09 - between the queue when they arrive at
05:10 - the front of the queue it should fire
05:12 - this function all right so here's my
05:14 - queue automatically getting guests added
05:16 - let's let them arrive and when he
05:18 - arrives he triggers on yes all right the
05:20 - front as you can see the others don't
05:22 - trigger the event when they arrived at
05:23 - their position now if I grab this one
05:25 - this will move the other one will move
05:27 - forward and far the event again there he
05:30 - goes he went away boom there you go okay
05:32 - great
05:32 - alright now that the event is correctly
05:34 - firing let's make it automatic to send
05:37 - the guests when the event is fire
05:38 - setting the game handler let's comment
05:40 - out this button and make it automatic so
05:44 - when the guest arises from the queue
05:46 - we're going to trigger the same thing
05:47 - that we were doing on button we need a
05:51 - member reference to all awaiting you and
05:56 - we're going to send him to the right
05:58 - side so at 280 and 40 plus 500 okay
06:04 - so now he should automatically send the
06:06 - guests away in order to make this easier
06:08 - to visualize and let's send him away
06:09 - only after some time so he doesn't get
06:12 - sent away immediately as soon as he
06:14 - arrives in there so I'm going to create
06:15 - a function timer create a new function
06:18 - and it will trigger this function after
06:21 - let's say one second so when the event
06:24 - is fired one second later you will
06:26 - actually grab the first guest in the
06:28 - queue and send them to the right so
06:30 - let's test it and see if our behavior is
06:32 - working correctly all right here's my
06:34 - queue automatically adding the guests
06:36 - and when they arrive he triggers on yes
06:39 - arrived and moves forward after one
06:41 - second now let's also add an event for
06:46 - when the guest is added to the queue
06:47 - into our waiting queue and let's add
06:49 - another public event
06:51 - event handler and say on guest added now
06:56 - this is going to be a very simple event
06:57 - simply in here when we add our guests if
07:01 - we have subscribers to the event let's
07:04 - trigger so back in our game home let's
07:09 - spawn this pop-up right here in the
07:11 - event rather than directly through that
07:13 - function so on guest added let's create
07:17 - a function for that event and it's going
07:19 - to trigger this so as you can see in
07:23 - here by using events we have the cup on
07:26 - this code from anything else we are
07:27 - executing in the game Hamel but it
07:29 - doesn't have to you can have a separate
07:31 - object deciding when to add the guests
07:33 - and then another one deciding what to do
07:35 - when they arrive the front the cue and
07:37 - another one doing something when they
07:39 - get added to the queue this way
07:40 - everything is nice and clean so much
07:43 - test make sure that our event is still
07:45 - being fired then the app gas pop-up is
07:48 - still showing you all right there you
07:49 - have it guests are being added to the
07:51 - queue and when they arrive in front they
07:53 - trigger the other event and move away
07:54 - automatically this is what we're going
07:56 - to use to set up the building logic in
07:58 - the next video again the game is still
08:01 - in development so if you don't like the
08:02 - concept go to the steam page and add it
08:04 - to your wish list and follow as always
08:06 - you can download the project files in
08:08 - utilities from Unity code monkey comm if
08:10 - you have any questions post them in the
08:12 - comments and I'll do my best to answer
08:13 - them subscribe for more videos and I'll
08:15 - see you next time
