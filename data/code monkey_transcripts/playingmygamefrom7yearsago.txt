00:28 - e
00:58 - e
01:28 - e
01:58 - e e
02:51 - hey everyone how's it going hope you're
02:53 - having a great day let me just is this a
02:56 - little bit
02:57 - off like that yeah hope you're having a
03:01 - great day today on this nice
03:03 - Monday uh
03:07 - right think set up yep so basically just
03:12 - yesterday I was looking at my steam page
03:15 - and I figured out I haven't played this
03:18 - game in many many years so I figured it
03:20 - would be nice to have a bit of a
03:22 - relaxing time I was working the whole
03:23 - morning so now would be nice to do a
03:26 - little bit of play time and I haven't
03:27 - played this game in quite some time how
03:30 - many of you know this honestly this is
03:31 - actually one of my favorite games one of
03:33 - my uh action games let's actually play
03:36 - the trailer and see if that
03:38 - works oh
04:23 - nice I know the special nice
04:38 - Ah that's nice I got to say normally I
04:41 - hate making trailers definitely one of
04:42 - the parts about game development that I
04:44 - most dislike but making this trailer I
04:47 - think it's actually the best trailer
04:48 - that I've ever made I think it's
04:49 - actually pretty nice pretty interesting
04:52 - uh it showcased the game showcases a
04:53 - bunch of things about the game so yeah
04:55 - normally I hate making trailers but this
04:57 - is probably the best one that I've made
04:59 - at least I think so that is actually
05:02 - quite a nice thing
05:05 - um start learning unity and coding just
05:08 - about two weeks ago I was wondering
05:09 - should I care about dots or something I
05:11 - should care for the future yeah dots is
05:12 - very much an advanced thing so I would
05:15 - say do not worry about dots if you just
05:17 - literally just start just focus on
05:19 - normal game objects making normal games
05:21 - uh make some like flppy Bird Space
05:24 - Invaders Pac-Man that kind of thing so
05:26 - make simple games just using uh just
05:28 - using regular Gam object just using
05:30 - regular Unity UI so yeah dots is very
05:33 - much an advanced thing so unless you're
05:35 - already a advanced programmer with
05:37 - interest in performance if that's the
05:39 - case then sure go ahead and use it but
05:41 - if not if you're just a beginner in
05:42 - general then yeah definitely do not
05:43 - worry about dots you can make many many
05:46 - games like for example this game this
05:47 - game actually has quite a lot of units
05:48 - and it was not made with dots so yeah
05:51 - it's a really awesome tool but it's
05:53 - definitely an advanc you so definitely
05:54 - do not uh do not use it right away if
05:57 - you are a beginner
06:00 - have you used red Twitter for marketing
06:03 - I've tried it but honestly to very
06:04 - little results I mean doing those uh red
06:07 - and Twitter those are very very
06:09 - difficult to find success on Reddit
06:11 - basically they have tons and tons of
06:12 - rules on all sorts of uh self-promotion
06:15 - kind of things so that one you can't
06:18 - really do it I mean you can do paid
06:19 - marketing which maybe that could work if
06:21 - you find some very Niche subreddits that
06:23 - relate to whatever your game is like if
06:25 - you're making like tycoons there's a
06:27 - tycoon subred so it probably would be
06:28 - wise to do some PID advertising there
06:30 - but in terms of organic things it is
06:33 - very very difficult if you can make it
06:34 - if you can get past the mods and you can
06:36 - get millions of views and of course that
06:37 - does work but for the most part if you
06:39 - do some kind of post uh advertising your
06:42 - own stuff on Reddit chances are it won't
06:44 - be removed so yeah and Twitter Twitter
06:46 - is more for uh finding Publishers and
06:49 - cont creators as opposed to finding
06:51 - players there are really not many
06:52 - players on Twitter so if you're looking
06:55 - for a publisher and if you're trying to
06:57 - contact a content creator to maybe play
06:59 - your game maybe that can be useful but
07:01 - in terms of players themselves Gathering
07:03 - wish list usually Twitter is really not
07:05 - all that good so yeah a good idea to use
07:08 - dots for mobile uh yep definitely I mean
07:11 - dots uh basically helps your code run
07:13 - much faster and the faster your code
07:15 - runs actually the uh less battery to
07:18 - consume so in terms of mobile where
07:20 - things are very performance limited it
07:22 - definitely helps to have something that
07:23 - works much much faster at the same time
07:26 - if your code runs much faster even if
07:28 - the device doesn't have S needed it also
07:30 - means that it takes quite a lot less
07:31 - battery which people usually quite
07:33 - prefer so yeah if you have a game that
07:36 - is suitable for Dots then yeah mobile is
07:39 - definitely one of the things that uh
07:40 - benefits quite a lot from from
07:43 - dots paying for advertisements to Market
07:46 - worth it uh that is a really tricky
07:48 - question and usually the answer is no
07:50 - not really uh simp because indie games
07:52 - are usually very cheap like five 10 15
07:56 - bucks and it's really hard to get a
07:57 - return on the ad spend based on that
08:00 - amount of money because even if your
08:02 - game is like 15 bucks steam is going to
08:03 - take like 30% so you keep like 10 bucks
08:06 - maybe less than that so yeah can you
08:08 - sell a copy using advertising with just
08:10 - 10 bucks that is usually very difficult
08:11 - unless you have a really great game so
08:13 - yeah for the most part for India
08:14 - developers paying for advertising is
08:17 - usually not going to be worth it is
08:18 - really
08:20 - tricky uh okay so let me go ahead and
08:22 - play the game and if later on if any of
08:24 - you wants to play it it's actually on
08:26 - discount just for the next 6 hours so if
08:28 - any of you want to pick it up on see you
08:30 - can do that okay so let me actually
08:31 - start it on the other thing it's
08:34 - actually been many many years since I
08:36 - last played this game so it's going to
08:38 - be interesting to replay
08:41 - it yeah put it
08:44 - just just put it kind of like this I
08:47 - think this should be
08:51 - good oh it's oh my controller just
08:55 - vanished I hope it didn't die that would
08:57 - not be nice uh
09:01 - let make sure that the audio levels are
09:03 - good let me try
09:07 - to put it just a little
09:11 - bit okay just making
09:15 - sure okay I think the Audio Level okay I
09:18 - think it's actually way too low it's
09:20 - always tricky to handle the audio make
09:21 - sure that my voice works but it
09:24 - doesn't uh okay so like this B like the
09:26 - game music is at like 40 Deb
09:30 - that one is on 20 okay so that should be
09:33 - good how' you get the menu art for this
09:35 - game I worked with an artist so most of
09:37 - the uh art in this game uh was handled
09:41 - by an artist so I contract an artist to
09:43 - do all kinds of Sprites the menu the
09:45 - logo and all kinds of things and it's
09:46 - actually really awesome I mean I wonder
09:49 - what yis is doing I mean uh right now I
09:51 - just have his name haven't spoken to him
09:53 - in ages but yeah this uh I was really
09:56 - happy in terms of visuals cuz usually my
09:57 - games suck at the visuals just because
09:59 - I suck at doing art so for this one
10:01 - hiring an artist to do it I'm still a
10:03 - big fan of this nice little uh scene for
10:05 - the main menu I really love the logo I
10:07 - think it is perfect exactly for what the
10:10 - game is about really fast night's
10:12 - playing around so yeah basically if you
10:14 - have very limited art CS kind of like
10:16 - myself then working with an artist can
10:18 - definitely help quite a little
10:21 - bit okay let's start a brand new game oh
10:25 - yeah these are the uh the
10:27 - um uh the Workshop support that I had
10:30 - for my game which is actually pretty
10:31 - nice which actually over here on the
10:32 - main menu over there on the top right
10:34 - corner does show and it does open up the
10:37 - thing and Y so I I added uh Workshop
10:40 - support to this game it's really awesome
10:42 - so people can make all kinds of Hero
10:44 - characters all kinds of Sword Shields
10:45 - and so on a bunch of people made some
10:47 - really nice stuff so something from
10:49 - Attack on Titan and yeah there's a whole
10:51 - bunch of characters really interesting
10:53 - things see look at that sounds really
10:56 - awesome to add some uh implementation
10:58 - for Workshop support and then see what
11:00 - the players do they do all kinds of
11:02 - things so some Minecraft stuff and yeah
11:06 - so yeah work shop support is actually
11:08 - really nice yeah and something that is
11:09 - actually not that difficult to do and I
11:13 - don't know if I yeah I didn't cover uh
11:16 - steam themselves but uh I did cover some
11:19 - modding so if you want to add modding to
11:21 - your games there's the uh ugc platform
11:23 - and this kind of thing so if you want to
11:25 - add mod into your game it's one of those
11:26 - things that sounds very intimidating but
11:28 - in reality it's actually
11:30 - uh quite doable so oh
11:34 - just uh and yeah adding modd into your
11:36 - games is always quite fun okay so let me
11:38 - go new game do a new game and yeah let
11:43 - me include all of them just have all
11:45 - these fun things new game all right oh
11:49 - yeah the character creat nice okay let's
11:51 - choose a
11:52 - name yeah the this Randomness was
11:55 - actually quite fun so basically I
11:56 - randomize uh I have a bunch of
11:58 - adjectives an array with a bunch of
12:00 - adjectives and an array with a bunch of
12:01 - first names and basically just
12:03 - randomizing all of those did anyone mod
12:06 - your games uh a bunch of people made
12:08 - some characters over here so yep that
12:11 - type of modding it did okay so let me
12:12 - pick a random name that was The Fearless
12:15 - okay I think that works uh and over here
12:19 - oh that's customizing all the there's
12:22 - the soldier and demo man that's fun uh
12:26 - let's go with default and let's
12:27 - randomize
12:30 - and tons of
12:31 - randomization lots of options one of
12:33 - them is the Ghost in the Shell face
12:35 - thing that's nice uh okay let's pick one
12:39 - not too spiky so may like this but
12:43 - different yeah I like this just the okay
12:46 - different
12:48 - weapon
12:51 - uh oh nice okay I think I like this one
12:55 - nice and big so like this all right so
12:58 - let's go
13:01 - yeah I have I don't know how long it's
13:02 - been since I played this game oh that a
13:05 - nice intro yeah about to break through
13:07 - and little characters I actually did
13:09 - draw these characters I didn't draw the
13:11 - main character and the swords and all
13:13 - that that was made by proper artist but
13:14 - these little minions I did draw them
13:16 - myself and I think they actually look
13:17 - quite nice uh and over here this
13:19 - actually something that I'm very proud
13:20 - of is the combat system for the for the
13:22 - game which is all based on hitting
13:24 - different buttons on the on the game pad
13:26 - so basically these little minions got
13:28 - attack three times on the X if I attack
13:30 - on the Y it doesn't deal damage and then
13:31 - there are other ones that have to mix YX
13:33 - and so on it's not the Buster sword I
13:37 - think it's kind of inspired by it I
13:39 - don't know where the uh artist took get
13:41 - inspiration but yeah definitely has that
13:44 - little
13:45 - shape all right go and these are
13:50 - yxy and look at all the characters
13:53 - fighting on the other side those are
13:55 - actually just dummies so they are not
13:57 - actual characters
13:59 - this is lost we have to leave oh and I
14:01 - also have a nice Dash and the stun
14:03 - counter oh yeah that's also
14:06 - fun oh oh yeah the combos nice this
14:10 - another thing that I really love about
14:11 - this game having some combos Zooms in I
14:14 - can aim in this case let's do the spike
14:16 - and look at the characters boom and they
14:19 - all fly away this is actually something
14:21 - really awesome I really felt that the
14:23 - moment that I added all of these blood
14:25 - particles and flying bodies that was the
14:26 - moment where the where the game kind of
14:29 - became quite a bit more special so that
14:32 - was definitely something that I enjoyed
14:34 - and the nice little overall map this
14:36 - also something that I really enjoyed
14:37 - making okay we managed to get out but
14:39 - the trasers to cover our lands so the
14:42 - whole idea is yep you look at this times
14:45 - and think like wow how did I make this I
14:48 - do honestly I I really enjoy uh playing
14:50 - my games from a long time ago because I
14:52 - mean it's very far in the past so I'm no
14:55 - longer at the uh mindset of okay I'm
14:58 - working on this non up now I can look at
15:00 - this as if it was a game that someone
15:02 - else made and it's really awesome it's a
15:04 - it's awesome when I look at a game that
15:05 - I made many years after making it and I
15:07 - still enjoy playing it I guess that
15:09 - tells me that I that I did a good job
15:11 - when I was making it so yeah this was
15:12 - fun uh now we need to fight and get it
15:15 - all back when reach that time yeah so
15:16 - basically the map control that is
15:18 - actually really cool which language did
15:20 - you use to code this I mean this made in
15:22 - unity so it's all in C uh we will need
15:25 - resources so we should begin by ring
15:27 - that Village okay so I can control my my
15:29 - little hero character over here in the
15:31 - overall map and there's a nice Hideout
15:33 - it has some characters some gold and
15:35 - some
15:36 - things okay so let's go oh and the map
15:39 - uh revealing actually don't remember how
15:42 - did I do this oh I think this one was uh
15:45 - cuz there are many ways that you can do
15:47 - some kind of fog of war effect for this
15:49 - one I think for this one I did yeah I
15:51 - think it's all based on a ren attack so
15:53 - basically there's a second camera from
15:55 - Top looking down and the characters they
15:57 - themselves have some kind of invisible
15:59 - won spread on top of them and as they
16:00 - move they are basically drawing on top
16:02 - of that render texture and that render
16:04 - texture is then used to basically create
16:05 - the mask for the showcasing the hidden
16:07 - areas and the visal areas and I remember
16:10 - that it was tricky for handling the
16:11 - saving and loading I don't know how I
16:13 - did that I'm guessing I just saved the
16:16 - screenshot as kind the uh the render
16:19 - texture as some kind of PNG but yeah it
16:20 - works pretty well it's actually very
16:22 - very nice and smooth it works quite well
16:24 - so yeah another interesting mechanic
16:27 - that I definitely really enjoyed
16:29 - okay so let's go into a battle how old
16:32 - are you I'm currently 35 which for some
16:35 - people apparently that's old but I
16:38 - definitely don't feel old so yeah okay
16:40 - the civilian know Must Destroy all the
16:42 - enemy
16:44 - camps oh yeah and the map so this game
16:46 - is obviously also very much inspired by
16:49 - hey Super Chat super serer thanks so
16:51 - much uh blet thanks so much uh so yeah
16:56 - this game was also very much inspired by
16:58 - Mountain blade I love that game so I
17:00 - definitely wanted to do something like
17:01 - it so that's why you control a hero
17:04 - character and there's all kinds of
17:05 - minions and you can also control minions
17:07 - guide them to go somewhere you control
17:08 - the overall map and so on so kind of
17:10 - like the tagline one of the main tag
17:12 - lines for this game was basically M
17:15 - blade in 2D that was kind of the rough
17:17 - idea that I was trying to do and uh I
17:20 - think it actually came out quite well so
17:22 - yeah okay let me just just move the
17:24 - super stier thank you so much uh okay so
17:28 - yeah so here I we got the world map
17:29 - close the map and now all of them are
17:31 - going like
17:33 - that so now I can move around and
17:36 - there's all the
17:38 - vages and take down all of
17:41 - those oh yeah and there's also the the
17:43 - counter nice this was a a fun one to add
17:48 - Bally I can counter the characters and I
17:51 - can also counter the arrows we got that
17:56 - one okay
17:58 - anyone
17:59 - else I really enjoyed making this the uh
18:02 - the uh units controlling the units and
18:04 - controlling the hero character having
18:06 - them all attack they all destroy all
18:07 - those things and again all these Sprites
18:09 - i hir n to do them that is why they I
18:12 - think they still look really good and
18:14 - the particles over here this looks
18:16 - really nice okay let's attack the next
18:18 - Camp go there oh go say a bunch of
18:23 - houses bunch of trees everything nice so
18:29 - okay there's another
18:31 - one another
18:32 - one okay the last few while they're
18:35 - shooting
18:38 - me nice I really enjoyed this uh combat
18:42 - mechanic system maybe one day I should I
18:44 - should make some kind of sequel to this
18:47 - game because for the core mechanics I
18:49 - definitely do think they are quite nice
18:51 - so nowadays I would probably be able to
18:53 - make this in a I don't know better
18:55 - production value make something a little
18:57 - bit more interesting even though I still
18:58 - think that this still I think it's one
19:00 - of the best looking games that I've made
19:01 - considering my my uh skill set uh but
19:05 - yeah doing something with my skills
19:06 - nowadays maybe in 3D that could be a fun
19:09 - thing there you go Victory nice got some
19:13 - gold experience level up and got two
19:16 - kills and no deaths
19:20 - nice took some L we should grab more
19:22 - units from The
19:24 - Hideout actually I don't think we took
19:26 - any losses but sure
19:30 - [Music]
19:31 - uh
19:34 - okay let
19:36 - righty to guess how long would a sequel
19:38 - take to make oh that's a good question I
19:40 - I have no idea I mean this game
19:44 - took I think it was a bit over a year
19:46 - like maybe 13 14 months something like
19:49 - that so yeah nowadays nowadays I'm much
19:53 - more skilled but if I were to do a
19:54 - sequel it would be a bit more complex it
19:56 - would be building upon this so on the
19:57 - one hand i'm skilled I also know the
20:00 - design that I would do but I would
20:01 - probably try doing in 3D with a bunch of
20:03 - different things so yeah I don't think
20:06 - it would take me 13 months though so I
20:08 - don't know maybe like six seven months
20:11 - to make a nice sequel something that
20:13 - takes this basally converts into 3D and
20:16 - that's a a few more mechanics that could
20:18 - be could be interesting make seal 3D
20:20 - environment 2D characters ah that would
20:22 - be nice that is actually one of the uh
20:23 - art styles that I very much would like
20:25 - to do someday in one of my in one of my
20:28 - games cuz I always enjoy that basically
20:29 - having a 3D world but you have flat
20:32 - characters I think that s always looks
20:34 - really nice so that could be interesting
20:37 - I mean in fact uh these characters
20:38 - actually the hero character it's
20:40 - actually the exact same animation system
20:41 - that I have for the characters down here
20:43 - for the uh live stream overlay so that
20:45 - overlay these characters that code I
20:47 - actually made that oh crap I actually
20:50 - made that all the way back in uh when
20:53 - was this game like
20:54 - 2017 so yeah the code for the the
20:57 - characters that I'm using down here here
20:59 - that did come from this game from this
21:01 - long ago yeah basically on this game I
21:04 - had to do so many things in terms of
21:05 - optimization in order to make it
21:06 - actually work correctly in order to make
21:08 - it functional
21:11 - so so yeah it was
21:13 - a it was definitely challenging because
21:16 - of how many characters I want to have on
21:18 - screen that was a big challenge so I
21:19 - having to make my own custom animation
21:21 - system just because all these characters
21:23 - in the beginning they were each set up
21:25 - of different body parts like the head
21:27 - would be a game object the body and
21:28 - another the game object each fit would
21:30 - be another game object the weapon and so
21:32 - on but that would make it very terrible
21:34 - in terms of performance so usually what
21:36 - you want to do is render the whole thing
21:38 - in just one mesh so that's pretty much
21:40 - what I did that's why I built this
21:41 - animation system that I'm using for the
21:43 - characters down here all of these
21:44 - characters these are just one mesh
21:46 - basically just one mesh of multiple
21:47 - quads and the fact that it's all just
21:50 - one mesh means that it all renders very
21:51 - quickly so all these if I have like 20
21:54 - characters on screen that's just 20 draw
21:56 - calls or actually just one or two
21:59 - or one per typ because of the uh same uh
22:03 - same material but yeah it makes it so
22:04 - much faster as opposed to having each
22:06 - body part on a separate on a on a
22:10 - separate thing okay let's grab some more
22:12 - units info what is the info oh yeah it's
22:15 - the upgrades nice uh speed I'm always a
22:18 - fan of speed how do
22:20 - I okay nice oh yeah and the
22:24 - combos oh yeah yeah I also I also
22:27 - remember this uh UPG upgrade system this
22:29 - upgrade window this one went through
22:31 - tons of variations tons of iteration cuz
22:33 - it was really tricky to get something
22:34 - that I wanted and the end I was really
22:36 - happy with this I think this is the
22:38 - first time in one of my games that I use
22:39 - a uh basically animated gifts in order
22:42 - to show the upgrades and I really like
22:43 - it so basically you can scroll down
22:45 - through all the upgrades and over there
22:47 - see a nice little window of exactly how
22:49 - they work so yeah I remember this was
22:51 - very tricky and when I figured out that
22:52 - you can actually make some animated
22:54 - videos inside of inside of unity and put
22:57 - it somewhere in your UI that was
22:58 - definitely the point where I where I got
23:01 - the basically the final iteration for
23:03 - this one and was interesting yeah the
23:05 - super slash the super sties are all
23:07 - really
23:10 - nice off topic but if you ever played
23:13 - prey was playing through and thought it
23:16 - was a good example of great level design
23:17 - I haven't but I've definitely heard very
23:19 - good things about it are you talking
23:20 - about the recent one I suppose so I
23:23 - definitely haven't played the one from
23:25 - like the early '90s but the Remake from
23:28 - like years ago I haven't played it but
23:30 - I've heard excellent things about it
23:31 - especially the DLC apparently DLC is
23:33 - really good the moon breaker or
23:35 - something like that so yeah that's
23:37 - definitely one of the games that I very
23:38 - much would like to play whenever I have
23:40 - some time just to just to research
23:43 - because yeah that one being a uh systems
23:45 - heavy game it should be quite
23:47 - interesting okay let's take down some
23:50 - more bad
23:51 - guys yeah the one by arinos yeah
23:54 - actually shame yeah that was the studio
23:56 - that just went down so oh man those are
24:00 - sadly
24:01 - sad
24:03 - H uh all
24:05 - right go take them all down don't get
24:09 - any nice oh yeah I can also stun them
24:15 - nice all right good can I try doing a
24:18 - castle
24:19 - Siege so the castle is 32 and then
24:23 - there's a bunch more around all right
24:26 - any big bugs in this game that you know
24:27 - about but haven't fixed no I don't think
24:29 - so I mean normally whenever I publish a
24:32 - game I stick with that game for at least
24:34 - a few months in order to make sure that
24:35 - everything is nice and B free as much as
24:38 - possible so as far as I know there's
24:40 - nothing uh gamebreaking so but yeah
24:44 - right and there's the little hit counter
24:46 - also forgot that I made that one nice
24:49 - and actually made tutorial on that
24:51 - one yeah basically if you get hit there
24:54 - you go now I'm
24:55 - 20 okay I don't want to get hit
24:59 - go three can I get
25:08 - more all right any more enemies okay
25:11 - there's just one over
25:12 - [Music]
25:13 - there
25:16 - o okay all my units go ahead take in and
25:20 - let's see many kitchen cha score serve
25:23 - save my Unity final project oh that's
25:25 - awesome hey uh I mean great job on
25:27 - learning from it it and going through it
25:29 - I mean the only thing I do is really
25:31 - just provide the knowledge it's up to
25:32 - you to actually learn so if you manage
25:34 - to go through your final project that
25:35 - means you actually learned so congrats
25:37 - on that that is really cool can you make
25:41 - all the asses for this game yourself
25:42 - nope for this one I very muchard an
25:44 - artist for pretty much all of the art
25:46 - assets I did draw the tiny little
25:49 - characters so all the Minions I did draw
25:51 - myself but the Hero characters all the
25:53 - environment art all of that I heard an
25:55 - artist this is actually one of the most
25:58 - most expensive games that I've made
25:59 - specifically for that because I hired an
26:01 - artist specifically to make uh pretty
26:03 - much all of the
26:05 - art oh so
26:09 - yeah but yeah I did hire artist which in
26:12 - turn is what helped make the game
26:13 - actually look quite decent which I think
26:16 - that nowadays it still looks quite nice
26:18 - okay go ahead and push it actually don't
26:20 - remember what's up top there I think
26:22 - it's just the like the uh throne
26:25 - room go go go
26:29 - oh yeah there's just the throne room I
26:31 - think on some maps cuz this is also this
26:34 - game also has quite a lot of uh prision
26:37 - generation oh there are more
26:39 - reinforcements coming will they get here
26:40 - in time they do
26:44 - nice okay that's
26:47 - fun see I really like the system cuz
26:49 - basically if I look on the map yeah I
26:51 - can see over there the uh basically the
26:53 - Overworld that one is still is still
26:55 - running even when I'm oh crap even when
26:59 - I'm inside a battle the Overworld is
27:01 - still running so that is why these can
27:03 - do can come with more reinforcements cuz
27:06 - all those characters are still moving
27:07 - around on the overall map okay so let me
27:10 - just take down these
27:12 - guys what is my oh I got hit once woo
27:16 - nice a bunch of gold experience and
27:19 - upgrade points and combo points all
27:22 - right nice that was
27:24 - cool here your game development journey
27:26 - is very inspirational nice been working
27:28 - hard in my own game however I have an
27:30 - issue where I commented on your Members
27:31 - Only video oh okay I won't I haven't I
27:36 - haven't gone through any of the comments
27:37 - today so yeah if you post something in
27:39 - the last 24 hours then I should be able
27:41 - to answer in a in a few hours probably
27:43 - after lunch so so so yeah definitely
27:47 - just a little bit and hopefully I should
27:49 - be able to help with whatever you're
27:51 - trying to
27:54 - do
27:55 - uh reminds me of the battles you can do
27:57 - in Assassin's Creed Odyssey that's
28:00 - actually one of the systems that I also
28:02 - enjoy I don't I don't remember how it
28:04 - was in Odyssey but in in uh in a
28:06 - Brotherhood when you could send out
28:08 - different uh assassins to do all kinds
28:11 - of missions over here on this one you
28:12 - can also hire uh hire allies to hold you
28:16 - and you can then send those allies to go
28:18 - into different places and yeah you can
28:20 - also take care of region so now this
28:22 - region is now ours nice and there are
28:25 - some Knights okay so like I was saying
28:28 - yeah let's go ahead okay so who should
28:31 - we recruit Simon the violent or Lance of
28:34 - fearless so this one has Earth shatter I
28:36 - really like that skill this one has
28:38 - Inspire and
28:39 - mortars that one is a little I really
28:42 - like Earth shatter so I guess let's or
28:44 - can I recruit both or I don't have money
28:47 - oh yeah right I can't
28:49 - afford
28:52 - okay yeah it would be nice but I only
28:55 - got 200 bucks yeah uh thanks so much for
28:58 - the Super Chat okay so yeah so there you
29:01 - go version 1.07 B so like I was saying a
29:03 - while ago usually when I make my games I
29:05 - try to update them constantly as soon as
29:07 - I can oh is that one going to attack
29:09 - that's one uh so yeah basically uh I had
29:13 - at least seven or eight different uh oh
29:17 - yeah I forgot that I could move the
29:19 - camera that's also nice uh
29:25 - right o
29:28 - and yeah the uh little hit counter
29:30 - window over there got 11 hits 24 hits oo
29:35 - nice that is actually something that I
29:37 - did I mean part of the reason why I
29:39 - started this channel was basically uh to
29:41 - share the knowledge that I had gained
29:43 - through making my game so this was the
29:45 - hit
29:46 - counter soas if you want to know how I
29:49 - made the hit counter in that game you
29:51 - can watch the tutoral where it shows
29:52 - exactly that so yeah basically
29:54 - especially in the beginning uh when was
29:56 - this this was in in 5 years ago in May
30:00 - 2019 so yeah back in May 2019 I made
30:03 - this and yeah it is basically showing
30:06 - how to make that little hit counter
30:07 - window just like I have in my game so
30:08 - yeah basically when I when I started
30:11 - this channel now I was looking for
30:12 - tutorials of things to cover that was
30:14 - kind of it I was kind of going through
30:15 - okay what are the things that I built in
30:16 - my own games how can I teach how to make
30:18 - them so yeah that was roughly the thing
30:22 - how many months did it take yep about 13
30:24 - 14 months something like that
30:26 - I uh actually on the did I post on the I
30:30 - don't
30:32 - know I probably post the change log but
30:36 - or actually can
30:38 - I see my
30:45 - little I still have
30:54 - the all right I look in that
30:59 - hero
31:05 - conquest yeah I don't yeah so basally
31:08 - this is the change log for the game yeah
31:09 - but this doesn't doesn't show when
31:11 - I oh yeah right I went through Early
31:14 - Access totally forgot about that yeah
31:15 - this game was in Early Access was
31:17 - actually so the first version was in uh
31:21 - February of
31:24 - 2017 that was the first version lots of
31:27 - updates lots of of upgrades tons of
31:29 - constant updates as I was building the
31:31 - game in Early Access and yeah that it
31:33 - was in version 1.0 when I got the phone
31:36 - release in 2017 so it was in Early
31:38 - Access for about 3 months yeah I guess
31:42 - so that's interesting it's fun to go
31:45 - back and see basically how how did my
31:49 - how did I handle my projects back then
31:50 - so that was actually quite interesting
31:53 - uh
31:55 - okay just
32:03 - there how did you do fun of war in the
32:05 - global map draing on some Mex texture
32:07 - yep exactly uh so basically got a camera
32:09 - up top looking down the characters have
32:11 - an invisible circle around them so as I
32:13 - move the character around you can see
32:15 - that the render texture is being
32:16 - revealed so basically basically the
32:18 - camera on top that is rendering onto a
32:20 - render texture that camera is set up in
32:21 - order to uh not clear on every update so
32:25 - basically that way the uh the uh Circle
32:27 - that is on top of the character here
32:29 - that Circle basically expands the area
32:30 - that I can see because it is not being
32:32 - cleared so it is constantly being an
32:34 - additive thing onto the fog of War
32:36 - texture and yeah that oh yeah and the
32:39 - the little the little things trading
32:42 - back and forth I forgot about that
32:44 - mechanic that was fun nice oh yeah right
32:48 - cuz the villages generate I just bought
32:50 - the game this shall be a fine piece in
32:52 - my large collection nice yeah I hope you
32:54 - enjoy it I mean I think this actually
32:56 - one of my games with the high review
32:58 - score so yeah I'm definitely still very
33:00 - proud of it 88% I'm pretty sure it was
33:02 - above 90 for a long time so yeah this is
33:04 - definitely one of my own favorite games
33:07 - and even right now playing it I'm still
33:09 - enjoying it so that's definitely always
33:11 - a good
33:12 - thing okay so let's try going out ruit
33:16 - Knights nope can't afford just yet okay
33:19 - so those are okay can I try let's go
33:22 - ahead and Ambush the Convoy are you
33:24 - planning on making a sequel if I had
33:26 - infinite time definitely I would love to
33:28 - cuz I really enjoyed making this game
33:29 - and it's actually the only action game
33:31 - that I've made all my other games are
33:32 - more strategy management things and this
33:35 - one was an action game and it was that
33:38 - way very much oh oh crap oh crap and it
33:42 - was that way oh ah cuz I don't have the
33:46 - thing I need the
33:51 - combos combo Fly Away boom nice uh so
33:55 - yeah basically this was my pretty much
33:57 - the only action game that I've made and
33:59 - the reason for that was actually
34:00 - intentional basically after making so
34:02 - many management Tycoon games I wanted to
34:04 - make something that could be played with
34:06 - a controller that was kind of the main
34:08 - idea that was kind of the main goal so
34:10 - that is why I made this one and it was
34:12 - actually a very interesting challenge
34:14 - although at the same time it was also
34:16 - one of my goals was to make since it was
34:18 - playable on a controller the goal was to
34:20 - Port it onto a console and that is one
34:22 - part that I didn't quite do uh so yeah
34:24 - that is some one of the things uh
34:26 - actually for my latest game Dy Guardians
34:28 - that is kind of the goal that I that I
34:30 - want to try to make it playable on a
34:32 - console since that game is also playable
34:35 - with a game pad and I've gone through a
34:37 - little bit of the process for signing up
34:39 - as a uh Xbox developer account but it's
34:42 - a really tricky thing so I haven't made
34:44 - much progress on it but yeah definitely
34:45 - would like to definitely would like to
34:48 - continue working on that at some
34:50 - time yeah oh and I've got some
34:53 - upgrades Dash recharge I like Dash
34:55 - recharge
34:58 - but yeah let's go with a combo to do a
35:01 - bunch more Combos and can I afford any
35:03 - of these nope the cost two so nope can't
35:07 - do
35:09 - it all right oh and there's another okay
35:12 - I only got 23 guys I should probably
35:14 - pick up some
35:16 - more oh let me pick it up uh take some
35:19 - units okay now I got 50 guys okay let's
35:22 - see 50 versus 50 can I defeat this
35:25 - guy okay let's see
35:28 - oh and there are some rein oh oh I just
35:31 - called in some reinforcements totally
35:33 - forgot about that mechanic and nice
35:34 - little intro for the thing this was very
35:36 - much uh inspired by uh uh oh God the uh
35:40 - Battle for Middle Earth game the uh
35:42 - shadow of War Shadow Mordor yeah
35:44 - definitely very much inspired by that I
35:46 - mean the Nemesis ISM was really awesome
35:48 - so this one is not exactly Nemesis but
35:50 - the characters are very unique they have
35:52 - random stats random names random things
35:54 - that was actually quite fun and I don't
35:57 - remember how it is to okay so they show
35:59 - where they are going to attack so he's
36:01 - now going to do an earth
36:05 - shatter oh right so the blue thing is
36:08 - basically their defense area so I got to
36:10 - hit them like that okay nice nice see
36:14 - again as I'm playing the game again many
36:16 - many years later I still enjoying the
36:18 - mechanics that I made back then so that
36:21 - is always a good
36:22 - sign okay take down this guy this
36:25 - guy St him
36:28 - anyone
36:30 - else quickly before he respawns boom
36:34 - nice they got a one combo bar that's
36:38 - cool shadow war was one of the first
36:40 - games I ever played wow nice that's a
36:42 - that's a good start yeah that was
36:45 - definitely really awesome game I played
36:46 - that one non-stop yeah that was really
36:48 - cool shadow of mortar yeah mortar was
36:50 - the first one war was the second one
36:52 - both them were great I really enjoyed
36:54 - both them it's a it's a shame they
36:55 - didn't do more of it recruit a knight
36:58 - okay I think I can afford Knight and
37:00 - there goes the guy with zero enemies and
37:02 - he's going
37:03 - away oh TJ hey how's it going thanks for
37:06 - being here morning Pros to write a
37:08 - patent dyamic system yeah that that's
37:10 - one of those things that is really
37:11 - stupid hey hey Phil you're here as well
37:13 - hey nice uh yeah that is really really
37:16 - quite silly I mean it's such an awesome
37:18 - system that could benefit from so many
37:20 - games but yeah they patented so nobody
37:23 - tried doing anything similar so that is
37:25 - definitely one of those H very annoying
37:27 - things like the entire industry gets all
37:30 - messed up just because one random public
37:33 - sh decided to uh decid to uh patent some
37:37 - kind of thing that was the same thing as
37:38 - when I think it was Sega which for like
37:40 - 20 or 30 years they patented the idea of
37:42 - having mini games and loading screens
37:44 - which that actually only expired like
37:46 - two or three years ago it's kind of
37:47 - crazy how can you patent something that
37:49 - is so so I don't know so normal that so
37:53 - many games have so yeah that is
37:54 - definitely very very
37:56 - strange my brother nice start learning
37:58 - Game Dev with your course a year ago
37:59 - nice and now we are releasing our first
38:01 - game on Steam oh that's awesome that is
38:03 - cool hey congrats on taking a game to
38:05 - release yeah I hope it's a I hope the
38:07 - release goes well so yeah congrats nice
38:11 - all right okay so can I recruit them uh
38:14 - let's go with Simon the violent right
38:16 - cool going to need all the help we can
38:18 - get can tell the Knight which region he
38:20 - should defend or attack open the info
38:23 - window okay and now on to the knights
38:25 - list okay nice so now I can tell him

38:44 - that okay let's see where he's going and
38:46 - he's going up there into that battle and
38:48 - he's fighting and he actually winning
38:51 - along with those okay now he's going
38:53 - there and now I think he's going to lose
38:54 - so let me give some
38:56 - backup okay let's
38:59 - see hey there he is Simon the valent hey
39:02 - nice actually implemented a a uh twitch
39:07 - implementation where basically the names
39:09 - for the things would be names of people
39:10 - actually watching but sadly I didn't do
39:13 - it for uh YouTube uh YouTube live
39:16 - streams I don't think YouTube live
39:17 - streams exist back then in 2017 so yeah
39:20 - basically just say twitch integration so
39:22 - yeah I wish cuz that was actually really
39:23 - fun it was something where basically
39:25 - people watching their name could show up
39:27 - on one of the characters then they could
39:29 - also vote for giving like different
39:31 - bonuses to essentially the streamer that
39:33 - was playing the game so it was actually
39:35 - it was a really fun thing it's really a
39:36 - shame that I made it just for twitch and
39:38 - doesn't work here on YouTube so yeah
39:41 - it's a it's a shame on that okay so
39:43 - let's go and let's attack yeah just go

40:07 - totally forgot that the tower also
40:09 - attacks and basally the hero character
40:11 - cannot destroy cannot damage buildings

40:16 - choice just to make it so that you also
40:18 - have to depend on your oh crap on your
40:21 - little
40:22 - minions oh oh just got to block all of

41:20 - the name of this game this is hyperight
41:21 - so it's one of my games so yeah if you
41:23 - want to pick it up actually it's on sale
41:25 - for another five bucks for just for
41:27 - another 5 hours for just a box if you
41:29 - want then yeah uh and yep uh tick
41:32 - systems are really awesome they
41:34 - basically allow you to
41:36 - do it's a really easy way to get a ton
41:39 - of extra performance by making sure that
41:41 - code that does not have to run on every
41:42 - single update you can run it just
41:44 - whenever just 10 times a second and so
41:46 - on so yeah I'm pretty sure pretty much
41:47 - all of my games I've always used uh uh
41:50 - tick systems because yeah they are
41:52 - really a super easy way to get a ton of
41:54 - extra performance so yeah I definitely
41:56 - encourage you to learn about them nice
41:59 - to see you live I really like your
42:00 - tutorials hey nice yeah I I would like
42:03 - to do some more live streams uh if only
42:06 - I could find a schedule that would work
42:08 - so right now it's still very much uh a
42:11 - bit random in terms of times but yeah
42:13 - every time I do it I enjoy it so I
42:15 - definitely would like to do it a little
42:17 - bit more it's always it's always fun to
42:19 - talk to people in real time as opposed
42:20 - to just the comments so yeah all right
42:24 - let's
42:25 - go why boom nice
42:30 - oh okay take
42:34 - out oh nice
42:37 - Victory course on need me Tower Defense
42:40 - isn't that some muchat this game me a
42:41 - few mechanics like Tower actually the
42:43 - tower visual is literally from this game
42:46 - so yeah what I the Sprites that I used
42:48 - uh in that course indeed a lot of them
42:50 - came from this game but that game is
42:52 - more like a uh tower defense strategy
42:55 - kind of game whereas this is more action
42:57 - so it's a very different gen but
42:59 - actually in terms of the uh the logic
43:01 - for controlling the units basically the
43:03 - logic that is not just controlling the
43:05 - action on the main character yeah for
43:07 - all of those that course does teach
43:08 - quite a quite a few things similar to
43:10 - that so a lot of things related to uh
43:12 - strategy games Tower Defense games RTS
43:15 - games so yeah if you want to learn how
43:16 - to make those kinds of games and yeah uh
43:18 - making though uh picking up that course
43:21 - should hopefully be helpful okay let me
43:23 - pick up some units just because I'm
43:25 - quite a bit did you draw this as
43:28 - yourself or had help with them nope this
43:29 - one was I very much H an artist to do
43:32 - pretty much all the all the Sprites so
43:35 - yeah CU myself I could not really uh
43:37 - draw this so although actually the
43:40 - little minion creatures I did draw those
43:42 - because they are so so tiny and so
43:44 - simplified but yeah all the all the
43:45 - trees the background all the Hero
43:48 - characters uh all of those were made by
43:51 - an actual proper artist this was
43:53 - probably the game that I invested the
43:54 - most in terms of hiring someone to some
43:57 - art uh cuz I've used uh a bunch of
44:01 - Assets in my own games but in terms of
44:02 - hiring an artist in uh Yep this was
44:05 - definitely the main one cuz I really
44:06 - wanted the game to look consistent look
44:08 - nice so yep definitely hard and artist
44:11 - for this one and I think it really
44:13 - helped the game look quite a lot
44:16 - better you have a tutorial on take
44:18 - systems I do actually it's been quite a
44:21 - long time but it's still very much a
44:22 - valid thing on the time TI system yep so
44:26 - this video when was this back in 2018 so
44:29 - yeah a very long time ago when I was
44:30 - basically covering the things that I
44:32 - learned from making my own games that
44:34 - was when I made this so the video is old
44:36 - but this still exactly the exact same
44:38 - system that I use nowadays it's really
44:39 - super simple you basically just have a
44:41 - class that constantly counts up with
44:43 - time do down to time and every x amount
44:45 - of time it just fires a tick and a bunch
44:47 - of other classes can listen to those and
44:49 - so
44:50 - on uh was making night game and a t
44:52 - system seemed like an obvious way to
44:53 - handle the amount of things that
44:54 - generate per second I'm guessing you do
44:56 - this guns although with that one be a
44:58 - bit careful uh it depends on the scale
45:01 - of the idle game that you're making cuz
45:02 - there are a bunch of idol games that
45:03 - generate things like if it's generating
45:07 - 60 times per second basically on every
45:09 - single update then at that point it
45:11 - doesn't make much sense to use uh a tick
45:14 - system because you're going to basically
45:16 - take on every single update so if it is
45:18 - something that doesn't happen as often
45:19 - definitely use a tick system but if it
45:21 - is something that is generating
45:22 - literally on every second cuz basically
45:24 - a lot of those idle games especially
45:26 - when you get into the late game it is
45:27 - constantly generating tons of resources
45:29 - and for those having the overhead of the
45:31 - events that might actually be a negative
45:33 - as opposed to a positive but in most
45:35 - case yeah if it isn't something that
45:37 - that happens every time then definitely
45:38 - use a t system and for that yep
45:40 - definitely use events so just firing off
45:42 - an event on tick something usually I
45:45 - have like on tick that uh happens on
45:48 - every single tick and I think usually I
45:49 - make the ticks like uh2 seconds so
45:52 - there's five takes per second but then I
45:54 - also have other events so I have an
45:55 - event on Take Five and that basically
45:57 - takes that fires off that event on every
45:59 - five tick that I have on take 10 and so
46:01 - on and so I can easily attach logic that
46:04 - runs at different rates and that helps
46:06 - make the game quite a bit more uh quite
46:09 - a bit more efficient so so yeah once
46:11 - again I really love T Systems definitely
46:12 - one of those things that is always
46:15 - really
46:17 - awesome would you ever release a source
46:19 - code to your own game so we have more
46:21 - code to phone games see how it all
46:23 - interacts uh probably not because uh
46:27 - this one still even though I made the
46:30 - game there it still used a bunch of
46:32 - third party tools so basically trying to
46:35 - so like for example on this one back
46:36 - then back when I made this game the uh
46:39 - unities input system did not exist so
46:41 - over here for oh there you go go uh so
46:45 - for handling all the controller Logic
46:46 - for this one I had to use a third party
46:48 - tool so so basically if I were to open
46:52 - source the code I would have to go
46:54 - through all of those I don't know like
46:55 - 30,000 lines of code in order to make
46:57 - sure there's no third party code over
46:58 - there so yeah that would be quite tricky
47:02 - so yeah that is why I don't think
47:04 - so there any estimate when the course
47:06 - will be available I don't know I was
47:09 - researching in in fact I would I still
47:11 - have it open right here so uh I've been
47:13 - researching a ton of stuff trying to get
47:15 - it all working and I've managed to get
47:17 - quite a few things working so I got the
47:19 - selection I can place down buildings I
47:21 - can queue up some units spawning the
47:23 - enemies have some Patrol they walk
47:25 - around they attack each other and so on
47:27 - I've got bullets and all kinds of things
47:29 - uh so yeah I've already made quite a few
47:31 - things but there's still quite a lot uh
47:33 - more to research and the main thing that
47:34 - I was researching is actually the
47:36 - animation and basically making dots
47:38 - animation is actually quite tricky
47:39 - because dots does not have any uh
47:41 - built-in animation thing so I was
47:43 - experimenting with different things and
47:45 - basically this is the option that I'm
47:46 - going to have which is I basically just
47:48 - baked a bunch of meshes and then using
47:50 - dots I'm basically just going to swap
47:51 - out those meshes one for the other and
47:53 - that's how I'm going to end up uh
47:55 - implementing the animation in the course
47:56 - so so yeah that was uh so basally still
47:59 - going through the Prototype the research
48:01 - stage so in terms of time no idea maybe
48:04 - just uh I don't know maybe maybe late
48:08 - next month something like that uh I
48:10 - don't know but it's going to be some
48:12 - quite a bit yeah oh hey Mia hey how's it
48:16 - going nice just woke up yeah really it's
48:19 - a midday 40 here it's always quite
48:21 - interesting how there are so many so
48:23 - many different time zones people from
48:25 - all over the place it's always a a fun
48:27 - thing to
48:28 - see I believe Minecraft also runs
48:30 - heavily on a TI system oh is it oh that
48:32 - is cool yeah I mean the game does have a
48:35 - huge world and especially when I have a
48:37 - built world with tons of tons of things
48:40 - all over the place with tons of redstone
48:42 - then yeah I guess they would need some
48:43 - kind of take system in order to make it
48:44 - quite a bit more
48:48 - efficient buing a game using construct
48:51 - 3 is it easy to transition from
48:53 - construct 3 to Unity really don't know
48:55 - how to code well I I've never used
48:57 - construct so I don't know exactly what
48:59 - is the thing but so do you just use
49:03 - visual things because if you just use
49:04 - visual things Unity also has visual
49:07 - scripting in fact I actually have an
49:09 - entire course so I'm making three
49:11 - separate games using nothing but visual
49:13 - scripting so I'm a I'm a big fan of
49:16 - visual scripting I think it's really
49:17 - awesome as a learning tool because
49:19 - basically by learning visual scripting
49:20 - you're essentially also learning
49:22 - programming because visual scripting is
49:23 - really just logic so if you use that as
49:25 - kind of like a stepping stone you can
49:27 - definitely learn quite a lot in terms of
49:28 - lodging that can be a good way to
49:30 - progress you from not knowing how to
49:32 - code to learning the basics of it so
49:34 - that can definitely help but at the same
49:36 - time you can also just make games
49:38 - entirely with visual scripting there are
49:39 - a bunch of games that work with those so
49:42 - so yeah I don't know the specifics about
49:43 - construct 3 but I would say definitely
49:47 - just just try it just uh open up Unity
49:50 - maybe go through my uh my uh kitchen
49:53 - chaos course which a lot of people have
49:54 - really enjoyed this one so maybe go
49:56 - through that one
49:57 - and try to see if you enjoy it and who
49:59 - knows maybe it's actually pretty easy to
50:01 - upgrade I'm not
50:03 - sure okay let me just let's try to take
50:07 - over a v oh my guy needs help okay let's
50:10 - go and try to give him some backup so
50:13 - he's against Leon the fighter okay let's
50:17 - see okay this game has nice game feel
50:22 - yeah I hope so that was definitely
50:23 - something that I spent quite a lot of
50:25 - time making it satisfying of the uh the
50:28 - combat system the movement The Dashing
50:29 - and so on that was definitely something
50:30 - that I worked very hard on and honestly
50:32 - I really enjoy it just playing it right
50:34 - now uh it's been 70 years pretty much
50:36 - since I last played this game and I am
50:38 - enjoying it so I think that is
50:39 - definitely good news and even the
50:41 - mechanics oh crap oh crap there's way
50:43 - too many
50:45 - guys so yeah I do think the game has a
50:47 - really nice design for all of those
50:51 - dodging them trying to
50:53 - stop boom nice okay there goes the
50:57 - hero let me go
51:00 - here go boom
51:03 - nice now just sto The Archers come
51:07 - here nice oh I got a 54
51:11 - combo oh is there another her oh no it's
51:14 - nice Okay cool so I lost 14 guys
51:19 - and
51:21 - uh really so my Ally only took out one
51:24 - guy well I think he took out the hero so
51:26 - I guess I guess that kind of Mak sense
51:27 - okay let me do some upgrades what can I
51:31 - upgrade oh Army size would be nice
51:36 - but oh this one takes two but yeah I do
51:39 - want more more combos I think that's fun
51:41 - and down
51:43 - here oh the worldwind I really enjoyed
51:45 - making this one yeah this was definitely
51:47 - a fun one oh and the flurry this one is
51:49 - really awesome for attacking the enemies
51:53 - bues Dash bars uh
51:57 - oh let's go with Whirlwind and one of
51:59 - Spike cuz I really enjoy the I really
52:01 - enjoy the
52:02 - spike let me just oh my gu is continuing
52:05 - to attack
52:07 - damn he only has three guys why oh no
52:10 - it's the other one so why is he oh
52:13 - there's another one crew the bond okay
52:15 - let's try to do that very familiar with
52:17 - Thor from Pirate
52:19 - software seeing you two talk The Game
52:22 - Dev having come from very different path
52:24 - I've definitely seen a lot of his uh
52:26 - shorts he's constantly on my shorts feed
52:29 - and yeah it's always it's always really
52:31 - enjoyable to hear what he has to say cuz
52:34 - yeah he definitely did take a very
52:35 - different path a path more of a triple A
52:38 - games with security and so on and yeah
52:41 - oh so yeah I definitely would love to
52:44 - talk to him someday cuz yeah definitely
52:49 - looks oh boy okay there's way too
52:55 - many nice
52:58 - okay down that one
53:03 - [Music]
53:04 - yeah
53:06 - okay use one more niceoo
53:11 - cool uh's
53:17 - that recently started your kitchen chos
53:19 - course nice is there a reason you
53:21 - created the Caps CL by code rather than
53:23 - just attaching it as a component was it
53:25 - because the movement uh BAS the answer
53:26 - is there are many many ways that you can
53:28 - always make uh pretty much any kind of
53:30 - system there are always a million ways
53:32 - to make it so technically yes you can
53:34 - just uh you can use a um a character
53:37 - controller the buwi one or you can do it
53:40 - via VIA just having the coll and listen
53:42 - to collisions or you can do it the way
53:44 - that I did by doing a a ray cast box
53:46 - cast you can do basically all of those
53:48 - are valid options all of those can can
53:50 - achieve the exact result uh so yeah in
53:53 - my case we only just uh personal
53:55 - preference I like doing a rast in order
53:57 - to find where are the things well
53:59 - actually the main thing that I like to
54:00 - use is actually to use physics and move
54:02 - it with physics and that way you don't
54:03 - have to deal with cisions but for that
54:05 - game I want for that uh for that course
54:08 - I want to make then the followup course
54:09 - using multiplayer and multiplayer using
54:11 - physics makes everything quite a bit
54:12 - more tricky so that is why I
54:14 - intentionally went with an option that
54:15 - does not use physics so that is why I
54:18 - that is why I went with that option of
54:19 - just sing the boxcast and so on but yeah
54:21 - pretty much you can do uh always
54:25 - remember there are many many way to
54:26 - solve pretty much any problem is that
54:28 - guy still fighting oh no he's getting
54:30 - more
54:31 - reinforcements okay let's attack that
54:37 - Village is that wind sound effect also
54:39 - used in battle round Tycoon good
54:41 - question maybe it is I don't
54:44 - actually that might actually very well
54:46 - be the case yeah I've reused tons of
54:49 - things in many of my games so anytime
54:50 - that I need sound effect or visuals or
54:53 - so on yeah I definitely I definitely oh
54:56 - that's a nice big map okay team X go
54:59 - there team y go there and yeah it should
55:02 - go through that one uh so yeah basically
55:04 - reusing tons of stuff is always one
55:07 - great way to be a lot more efficient
55:10 - boom give him a nice stun and don't take
55:13 - care of
55:14 - him there's another one up
55:17 - here take him
55:18 - out let me go up here oh there's
55:21 - actually the guy okay let me try soloing
55:23 - The Village Captain okay let actually
55:26 - just take down the minions
55:30 - first boom nice okay okay now let me
55:34 - solo this guy obviously I got to hit him
55:36 - on the other side otherwise oh YX y y
55:43 - nice see I I don't remember how long it
55:46 - took me to come up with the the combat
55:48 - system for the heroes but honestly I
55:49 - really enjoying I think it is still
55:52 - really nice ah crap messed up do I have
55:56 - a healing oh nice okay so my guys are
56:01 - now yeah they should be destroying that
56:03 - one and then come over
56:06 - here
56:08 - right
56:15 - uh would be really cool if you make a
56:17 - tutorial of this game I mean many of the
56:19 - elements over here I've covered in many
56:21 - many places so like the one that I uh
56:25 - talked a while ago the one about the hit
56:27 - counter so the hit counter that I use
56:29 - for the uh every time uh hit something
56:32 - so here I've got a hit counter of three
56:34 - so I've done that one for the character
56:36 - controller in 2D so yeah this one is
56:39 - basically the exact same controller that
56:41 - I'm using over here so yep this one is
56:44 - made using physics just move the
56:45 - character and so on it's actually using
56:47 - the exact same Sprite so you can see
56:49 - those are the same Sprites so so yeah
56:52 - many of the things here and for the
56:54 - animation system uh cuz I was telling
56:56 - you a while ago how the uh not animation
56:59 - mesh the mesh animation system so
57:02 - basically the way that this game is so
57:03 - performant with so many units at oh crap
57:05 - he respawned uh basically the way this
57:07 - is so performant with that many units at
57:09 - once is because of this mesh animation
57:11 - system so so yeah basically many of the
57:13 - systems that I'm using in this game I've
57:15 - covered in various tutorials long time
57:18 - ago can you speak Portugal Portuguese
57:22 - sure yeah so
57:40 - [Music]
57:50 - speak Brazilian uh I don't know what
57:52 - what are the specific Brazilian things I
57:55 - mean Brazilian Portuguese are
57:56 - very similar
57:58 - so so yeah basically by speaking
58:00 - Portuguese if you are Brazilian
58:01 - hopefully you can understand me uh oh
58:04 - crap no ah crap take out this
58:09 - [Music]
58:15 - guy
58:19 - okay
58:22 - nice all right good
58:27 - [Music]
58:28 - are that you're awesome keep up the
58:31 - great work nice thank you uh would you
58:34 - make a tutorial on how to make tutorials
58:36 - in your general process behind the
58:37 - scenes that is an interesting one I have
58:39 - thought about that topic several times
58:42 - before but it's also a very oh yeah
58:44 - they're going to reinforce I forgot
58:45 - about that uh yeah that is an
58:47 - interesting topic but it's one of those
58:49 - it's kind of like optimization which is
58:51 - an interesting topic but it's really
58:52 - tricky to to make a compelling video
58:55 - about it so yeah in terms of the process
58:58 - for how do I make tutorials I'm not sure
59:00 - how how good that video would be in
59:03 - terms of being a compelling thing to
59:05 - watch and to watch and and enjoy and
59:10 - learn something from it cuz yeah it's a
59:11 - very very Niche thing so but yeah it is
59:14 - definitely oh reinforced
59:18 - nice
59:19 - uh so yeah definitely one idea that I've
59:22 - had many many times but yeah if I can
59:25 - fix figure out some way to make it
59:27 - compelling engaging then yeah maybe one
59:30 - day oh Spike boom
59:34 - nice take him out take him out take him
59:37 - out no that
59:39 - guy uh yxy triple leg
59:44 - niceo how old is this game yep 7 years
59:47 - old
59:49 - so say when was this back in yep May of
59:53 - 2017 oh it's actually literally I didn't
59:56 - even notice but yeah I guess it is
59:59 - literally seven years and one day on I
60:01 - didn't even I totally didn't even notice
60:04 - that but yeah apparently came out in 19
60:06 - of May so yeah literally like seven
60:08 - years and one day ago so yeah that was
60:10 - that was
60:14 - fun did you ever get deep into Shader
60:17 - and techart uh not deep I mean I've made
60:21 - basically just the just the basics of it
60:25 - so anytime I need Shader fact I learned
60:26 - how to do it but yeah I don't normally
60:29 - don't normally do shaders for fun I do
60:31 - them to learn something and that's oh
60:34 - yeah right I forgot that I can upgrade
60:37 - totally forgot about the upgrades and
60:38 - why is my guy constantly getting into
60:41 - fights okay let's help
60:51 - him how old have you been when your
60:53 - first TNT project I mean I made
60:56 - my first TNT project one wasn't like in
61:00 - oh that he's firing a warwind uh so I
61:04 - got into unity in
61:06 - 2012 so I guess by then I would have
61:10 - been like
61:13 - 25 I don't know I I can't do math this
61:16 - is way too much
61:17 - pressure
61:19 - uh oh so but yeah it was in
61:24 - 25 uh uh it was in uh
61:27 - 2012 and I'm currently 35 right now so I
61:30 - don't know you do you do the math I
61:32 - don't know I don't know how old that was
61:36 - um does this game use dots nope this was
61:39 - back in 2017 where dots was not a thing
61:42 - so nope does not use oh look at that
61:45 - I've got quite a bit of M quite a bit of
61:47 - gold so let's hire another one lance to
61:49 - Fearless okay and for Lance let me okay
61:53 - so he's defending that one and Lance
61:56 - yeah you start both of you start
61:57 - attacking that one so you go that one
61:59 - you go that one
62:01 - okay all
62:03 - right and for the village yeah let me
62:05 - upgrade oh yeah how much can I upgrade
62:08 - oh level three okay nice that is
62:12 - cool and on this one can I upgrade okay
62:16 - just got 100 bucks and do I got any
62:19 - upgrades
62:22 - uh oh Max friendly nights oh nice
62:26 - the over map speed so many things are oh
62:29 - gold per unit this always something that
62:31 - I I love in pretty much every game
62:32 - basically any kind of upgrade that gives
62:34 - you either more gold or more experience
62:36 - that is always something that I love so
62:37 - definitely going to pick that up and for
62:39 - the
62:41 - upgrades uh B can be fun okay let's try
62:45 - bolt you make the overall maps in this
62:48 - game seems like good video idea for King
62:51 - Town Maps if you're planning an RTS
62:54 - series uh for this one I mean the map is
62:57 - pretty simple it's literally just a huge
62:58 - map and the camera is zoomed out then
63:00 - for the fog of war that one is basically
63:03 - a camera looking down rendering onto
63:04 - texture and then each unit has a circle
63:06 - around it so basically that's how it
63:08 - sees the uh basically that's how the fog
63:10 - of War extends and uh reveals which is
63:14 - actually something that I'm going to
63:14 - cover in the RTS course so that that is
63:17 - one of the things that I still have on
63:18 - my two research phase I'm still not sure
63:20 - cuz there are many many ways that you
63:21 - can do fog of War so that is one of the
63:24 - things that I don't know uh still don't
63:28 - know exactly what method I'm going for
63:29 - but yeah definitely I want to cover that
63:32 - in there let me
63:34 - just attack those
63:37 - guys when do you stop updating a game
63:40 - with content when do you decide that you
63:41 - did enough for it uh I mean that depends
63:45 - on what exactly is your goal like uh is
63:48 - your goal just are you just enjoying
63:51 - making the game or are you doing it for
63:52 - some kind of financial success cuz
63:55 - basically what ever you answer that is
63:56 - going to depend boom nice it's going to
63:59 - depend how much you do so do you want to
64:02 - just do bups I mean I always encourage
64:04 - you to do bug fixes like if the game has
64:07 - some bugs that you can fix definitely go
64:08 - ahead and fix them so don't move on to
64:10 - another game until the game is at least
64:12 - solid but beyond that in terms of adding
64:14 - extra content it depends do you want to
64:16 - continue working on it yes or no and if
64:19 - so then definitely do uh keep adding on
64:22 - to it but yeah cuz like on this game I
64:24 - actually also experiment with making
64:26 - some some DLC for it it was pretty much
64:29 - the only time that I uh tried it out
64:31 - just doing some simple basically extra
64:33 - modes tried out some free DLC and some
64:35 - pay DLC just to see how it would go and
64:37 - it was an interesting thing trying to
64:39 - make that but yeah in terms of
64:42 - conversion didn't really convert too
64:43 - much so it was an interesting experiment
64:45 - but yeah in terms of DLC really need a
64:48 - really massive user base in order to
64:50 - make it worthwhile for the uh DLC but
64:53 - it's a it's an interesting thing again
64:55 - depends if your goal is just to have fun
64:57 - then yeah maybe constantly adding more
64:59 - content that could be quite fun quite
65:03 - interesting
65:06 - uh Val ability creates a large green
65:08 - Cloud area of smoke the area changes
65:10 - shape depending on position deployed
65:12 - could this be done with some kind of
65:13 - mesh generation I haven't played valant
65:16 - so I'm not sure but isn't like the um
65:18 - the uh smoke grenade then smoke
65:22 - grenade Counter Strike too cuz that was
65:25 - an interesting one that was basically uh
65:26 - doing oh yeah I think ice R did a video
65:29 - on that so that was quite interesting um
65:33 - see basically basically how the how the
65:36 - smoke expands so that is basically using
65:38 - voils in order to figure out what is the
65:40 - area that the smoke can expand to so I
65:42 - don't know if valant is similar to that
65:45 - but yeah this actually this one of those
65:47 - systems that I would love to spend some
65:48 - time just research just for fun because
65:51 - yeah do seem quite interesting yeah put
65:53 - out the smoke and it acally grows the
65:56 - voxel and so on yeah definitely I've got
65:58 - tons of ideas that I'd love to do in
66:00 - terms of voxel game development all
66:02 - kinds of systems that you can do with
66:04 - boxel that is actually quite something
66:06 - that I would love to try out okay let me
66:08 - just grab
66:09 - some some extra guys and let me actually
66:12 - upgrade this one hey got another Village
66:15 - oh this guy's attacking a tower by
66:16 - himself okay let's give him some
66:24 - help uh
66:27 - okay so let's go ahead and yeah just
66:29 - both of you go there just straight up
66:32 - and let's see okay they got 65
66:36 - guys oo
66:38 - nice oh it's a tower I to only oh oh
66:42 - yeah that's my that's my guy doing that
66:44 - okay
66:46 - good okay the captain and he's got a
66:48 - deflect and
66:51 - mortars oh crap he hit me
66:58 - okay take him out take him out y y YX
67:02 - oh YX y y nice and all these guys in a
67:06 - row boom nice I still haven't tried the
67:11 - let me do the worm wind so let's ex
67:14 - boom
67:16 - nice oh crap oh crap oh crap don't only
67:19 - forgot how did I die okay I got the
67:22 - second chance nice get out okay I have
67:24 - no idea did I I get oh I think I was
67:27 - getting hit by the Yeah by the tower I
67:29 - totally missed
67:30 - that I'm make sure not to die and just
67:35 - do a little bit of
67:44 - healing okay take more
67:47 - out okay that was
67:49 - tricking a crap another one hit me yeah
67:52 - I forgot that getting hit by by arrows
67:55 - actually
67:56 - causes uh let me
67:59 - try just deflect all the arrows so my
68:02 - guys can finally do it there's the
68:05 - captain
68:09 - out out
68:11 - nice okay there you
68:20 - go game Jam wi I would love to that's
68:24 - definitely one of the things that I've
68:25 - thought about doing many many times
68:27 - before but yeah organization is really
68:30 - tricky so I would love to do to organize
68:32 - a game Cham at some point but
68:36 - yeah got to figure out how can I
68:38 - organize it how can I make it
68:41 - interesting fun and doable so yeah
68:44 - definitely an idea that I've had many
68:46 - many times oh are they attacking
68:51 - my this one
68:53 - fighting a bunch of people fighting here
68:56 - uh see eventually I definitely would
68:57 - like to uh do a game jam oh crap do
69:01 - I this gu qu okay two
69:07 - guys
69:10 - [Music]
69:12 - okay crap a crap cuz there's two of them
69:15 - that's
69:17 - freaky [ __ ] boom okay y y XX oh oh crap
69:22 - another one oh boy oh oh boy do I have
69:27 - to retreat oh crap
69:31 - oh oh am I out of guys where my where's
69:35 - all my guys go go go get
69:38 - out oh
69:41 - no
69:43 - no okay I suffer the defeat okay get
69:46 - away get awayo that was
69:50 - tricking ah just oh crap they're going
69:54 - let me pick up some guys from
69:56 - here that was that was
70:00 - tricky
70:04 - uh you think compete shaders are
70:06 - outdated due to render Pipeline and
70:08 - Shader graph uh not really I mean
70:10 - compete shaders are great whenever you
70:13 - need insane performance they're really
70:14 - tricky to to build but yeah you
70:16 - definitely need uh definitely need
70:19 - insane knowledge to make them but no
70:21 - they don't really uh get replaced by R
70:24 - Pipeline and Sh I mean if you if you
70:25 - want to make something insanely
70:27 - efficient then using computer shaders is
70:29 - definitely the way to go that's actually
70:31 - an an uh a topic that I've wanted to
70:34 - research for a long time CU yeah you can
70:35 - do a lot of really interesting stuff
70:37 - with comput Traders so
70:40 - yeah how do you create the animated
70:42 - people below you mean the uh little
70:44 - overlay I actually do have multiple
70:47 - tutorials on that so if you want go on
70:49 - to that page and at the very bottom you
70:52 - can see so basically this down here the
70:54 - characters this is a transparent UT
70:56 - window so I cover that in this tutorial
70:58 - then the way the characters move about
71:00 - and animate these are mesh B animations
71:01 - and the way that it's interacting with
71:03 - YouTube API is through an HTP request
71:05 - from inside unity and the characters
71:06 - themselves the way they are random is
71:08 - exactly the same way that I did in my
71:09 - game battle round Tycoon for the GU
71:10 - spres so yeah if you want to learn how
71:12 - to do this thing just follow these four
71:14 - tutorials and you'll get
71:18 - there okay let's see if I don't hold
71:21 - this one
71:28 - okay ah crap messed up go this come oh
71:31 - it's not the healing no no oh crap I
71:33 - messed
71:37 - up boom
71:42 - [Music]
71:45 - nice
71:47 - okay oh that I got a combo of 80
71:50 - nice be interesting to see you remake
71:53 - this with what you know now including a
71:54 - nemesis system for captains yeah that
71:56 - would definitely that would definitely
71:58 - be fun I would I would definitely love
72:00 - to I would love to be able to find a
72:02 - time machine in order to in order to be
72:04 - able to pursue all of the various
72:05 - projects that I very much would like to
72:07 - do so yeah remaking this game would
72:10 - definitely be quite fun oh yeah let's do
72:12 - the Inspire they move and attack faster
72:14 - so that is always really good to bed
72:16 - have a great night yeah have a great
72:17 - night thanks for thanks for being here
72:21 - uh is that guy attack oh no he's
72:23 - grabbing units okay that makes sense
72:26 - oh there's a lot of guys here oh okay
72:29 - let's try fighting a bunch of
72:35 - them okay let's see Leon the fighter and
72:38 - he's got hert shatter
72:43 - okay okay
72:48 - stop let me do a ah crap I thought I had
72:51 - enough I don't
72:56 - oh Spike boom
73:05 - nice uh what is it the worm wind boom
73:09 - nice okay take them out take him out
73:12 - take them
73:12 - [Music]
73:16 - out okay just I just stun them all woo
73:20 - nice that was cool
73:26 - can you open this in the editor just to
73:28 - see how things are organized uh I do
73:30 - have the project files but I don't think
73:32 - I have an editor version that can open
73:34 - them so that could be fun trying to uh
73:36 - try opening these own projects in a
73:38 - recent un version see how it works that
73:42 - that could be could be an interesting
73:45 - one so yeah I definitely have to spend
73:47 - some time doing that basically uh
73:49 - converting the the games because yeah I
73:51 - still have all the source files all the
73:53 - things so that could be uh quite
73:55 - interesting okay someone is still
73:57 - fighting here why are you
74:08 - fighting there's a book called the unity
74:10 - Shader Bible yeah I've heard great
74:12 - things about that book I haven't read it
74:14 - myself but yeah from what I from what
74:17 - I've read the feedback seems to be very
74:18 - positive so if you want to uh study on
74:21 - shaders then yeah definitely get the
74:23 - unity Shader bball which
74:25 - seems like a great book to learn from
74:28 - okay oh
74:30 - nice okay let's try attacking another
74:34 - Another Castle
74:36 - actually okay it's kind of I guess it's
74:39 - one thing that I would wish I had made
74:41 - for this game some kind of Zoom because
74:42 - I can't see just how many fights are
74:45 - having here so apparently Leon the
74:48 - fighter he's there crew the ball he's
74:50 - got 40 guys for the patient so who is my
74:54 - other guy attack attacking I don't know
74:56 - okay let's go with the the biggest
74:58 - one and try to see if we can win
75:02 - this okay there screw the bones prepare
75:05 - to die oh get out oh crap
75:12 - yeah okay like that like
75:18 - that nice take him out good
75:23 - [Music]
75:26 - nice okay you take out that guy who
75:31 - W can I get the uh bolt y
75:35 - yxx boom
75:38 - nice woo okay come on pick out this guy
75:42 - nice
75:44 - woo oh I still lost 20 guys that was
75:46 - quite a
75:49 - bit okay so cuz I want to attack the
75:53 - can't I attack the
75:55 - I don't remember if I have to take down
75:57 - all things before the
75:59 - castle guess let's try fitting this one
76:02 - and
76:06 - see mod games what feature do you look
76:08 - at thinking I have no idea how to make
76:10 - that how is a very good question uh I
76:13 - don't actually
76:14 - know I mean there are lot of things in
76:17 - which I have no idea how it's done but I
76:20 - have a rough idea on how they could be
76:22 - done mainly all kinds of things of being
76:24 - like [ __ ] effects and all kinds of
76:25 - things so yeah I'm not a Shader expert
76:28 - so if you ask me to do some kind of
76:30 - weird Shader effects like for example
76:32 - the uh the uh Two Worlds that exist in
76:35 - that level in Titanfall 2 that looks
76:37 - like a really awesome Shader effect
76:38 - really awesome thing so I have a rough
76:40 - idea for how that could be done but
76:42 - doing it specifically not quite but yeah
76:44 - in general any kind of thing that I have
76:47 - no idea how to do that is uh that's an
76:49 - interesting question because for me
76:51 - usually whenever I see some kind of
76:52 - mechanic I know how how I could have
76:55 - done it I don't know exactly how it
76:57 - might have been done but I can always
76:59 - figure out some uh some kind of way for
77:02 - how I could do something like that so so
77:04 - yeah I don't know cuz basically when you
77:07 - have enough programming knowledge
77:09 - everything is really just a combination
77:11 - of different systems
77:13 - so so yeah basically for me whenever I
77:16 - see some kind of game I can always sort
77:17 - of figure out how might this thing be be
77:20 - done
77:21 - so okay I need a lot more guys
77:25 - grab bunch more
77:27 - guys cuz those are constantly
77:30 - reinforcing okay so I got to defeat them
77:32 - very quickly in order to take down that
77:33 - castle okay yes Frederick go
77:37 - ahead oh
77:40 - okay
77:47 - nice
77:49 - [Music]
77:52 - nice okay go
77:55 - come on
77:58 - nice
78:00 - okay all right that was good I don't
78:03 - think I lost many guys K let me uh yxx
78:07 - oh this one is a tricky one YX uh x y y
78:19 - nice you're feeling that knowing how to
78:21 - make stuff ruins the mystery and wonder
78:23 - like learning how magic tricks start
78:25 - honestly no I know a bunch of people do
78:27 - feel that way uh fact I saw a post like
78:31 - just a few weeks ago talking about some
78:33 - I don't know some redit post on some guy
78:35 - who was in extr movies and felt that
78:37 - seeing things behind the scenes kind of
78:39 - ruins the magic of movies but for me
78:41 - I've never really felt that I can I can
78:43 - play a game I can think to myself okay I
78:45 - can I understand how this whole thing
78:47 - works in the background but I can still
78:49 - really enjoy it so yeah that is
78:51 - definitely one of those uh personal
78:53 - things for some people that really
78:54 - bothers them but for me no for me I
78:57 - really I enjoy learning how things are
79:00 - done and I let me take out I think I
79:02 - need to take out the rest before I can
79:04 - go there uh so yeah for me I I can enjoy
79:07 - playing it while also thinking about how
79:09 - it might have been done background so
79:10 - for me basically seeing uh how the
79:13 - sausage is made does not really bother
79:15 - me at all so yeah I guess that's a I
79:17 - guess that's a good thing so it does not
79:19 - does not impact my enjoyment of all
79:22 - kinds of games so yeah a crap crap way
79:25 - too
79:27 - many crap I'm taking so much
79:30 - damage on Boom
79:32 - [Music]
79:34 - nice oh man they're quite a lot of
79:39 - them okay take
79:41 - out
79:45 - nice ooo nice okay
79:48 - good just can I get a little bit of
79:51 - healing nice
80:00 - my favorite TNT devs hey nice hey thanks
80:03 - for being here Jen that's cool Trav or
80:06 - attempt to do VR Dev uh no not exactly
80:09 - I've done some research for it in fact I
80:11 - was actually going to uh make a tutorial
80:14 - on it I was actively doing the research
80:15 - in order to make tutorial but then I I
80:18 - got way too busy cuz unit6 came out so I
80:21 - started doing research on the dot scores
80:23 - so I kind of had to push back that that
80:26 - go with that uh VR tutorial so yeah I
80:29 - haven't done any serious VR work but I
80:32 - definitely would like to uh cuz yeah
80:34 - it's a very interesting area I think
80:36 - it's a great area I think it's something
80:38 - that is uh growth is definitely very
80:41 - slow definitely takes quite a oh I need
80:44 - to upgrade to get more Knights where's
80:46 - my Knights Max friendly Knights okay
80:49 - um so yeah growth in VR has been slow
80:52 - but I do think it's a really awesome
80:54 - area and I do think it is something that
80:55 - will increase over time so oh yeah I
80:59 - told them to come here and attack this
81:00 - one so let me try let's go to this one
81:02 - with 90 okay I think this is going to be
81:04 - tricky so let's see uh so yeah I haven't
81:07 - really spent much time in VR but
81:08 - definitely is something that I would
81:10 - like to experiment because I do enjoy
81:12 - playing VR games whenever I whenever I
81:14 - get to do them so learning how they work
81:18 - would also be very fun okay one goes
81:20 - there one goes there oh yeah I did oh I
81:23 - may the Inspire but I don't start okay
81:25 - let me get some combo
81:28 - bars a
81:30 - [Music]
81:32 - crap ah just one
81:35 - more okay for all of you let me Inspire
81:38 - oh I need two combo bars in our to
81:40 - inspire
81:46 - okay uh-oh another guy joined it's going
81:49 - to be tricky
81:54 - [Music]
81:56 - oh crap I shouldn't have split them
81:59 - up okay you both of you go onto that
82:03 - one because I don't think I got enough
82:05 - guys to be able to okay stop hitting my
82:08 - guys all right me just try to protect
82:12 - them
82:15 - okay he stop stop
82:22 - stop o nice okay one
82:26 - more oh yeah I think I can can I damage
82:30 - no yeah but I think with Earth shatter I
82:32 - can damage
82:40 - buildings on take out that let me do the
82:43 - Inspire so a y y
82:45 - a okay
82:48 - nice they go ahead take out all that
83:01 - Oh
83:02 - [Music]
83:05 - Captain what is he doing oh I think he
83:08 - was doing
83:10 - Inspire boom oh there he goes oh he's
83:14 - got a
83:15 - lightsaber that's
83:17 - nice okay Outpost Captain I don't know
83:20 - what you're doing but
83:24 - oh oh go go go go boom
83:30 - nice okay I've got to take him
83:33 - out
83:35 - oh x x nice okay good good
83:40 - [Music]
83:42 - good oh boy these are way too many guys
83:46 - okay good
83:48 - nice both of you attack
83:52 - there yeah first they have to Le rush or
83:55 - it's Prett Calon for you and don't
83:56 - stress on making a patch of first day uh
83:58 - usually my extreme stress comes on the
84:00 - day before it's like on on dinky Gardens
84:03 - my last game I worked like I don't know
84:06 - I think I worked like 16 hours on
84:08 - literally day before release so yeah for
84:11 - me usually it's really stressful
84:13 - constantly thinking about things but
84:15 - after it's out as long as I did a good
84:17 - job be before it and the game is stable
84:20 - as long as I do that then I can not
84:22 - necessarily relax too much but
84:24 - definitely
84:24 - uh be a bit more calm so yeah for me
84:27 - usually day before really stressful and
84:29 - then the day of release things do calm
84:31 - down a little bit okay go ahead keep
84:35 - defending my
84:37 - guys PR dots how would you approach
84:40 - projectile Trails that's actually a good
84:42 - qu okay a y y a uh projectile Trail is
84:45 - actually a good question that is one
84:46 - thing that I still haven't uh research
84:48 - in my prototype is how do you handle oh
84:51 - crap how do you hand on trail effects oh
84:53 - crap no
84:54 - guy
84:56 - um so yeah cuz I don't think that the
84:59 - trail oh crap another guy oh boy this is
85:01 - going to be tricky uh cuz I don't think
85:04 - that uh the trail render has that
85:07 - support although I haven't tried it so I
85:09 - don't know but yeah I think basically I
85:12 - will have to manually try to build the
85:15 - projectile
85:17 - Trails would you look into build board
85:19 - Sprites as an option yeah probably I
85:21 - mean I think if it doesn't support the
85:23 - trail run by default then then basically
85:24 - you have to create your own trail render
85:26 - so basically you have to create the
85:27 - dynamic mesh and then updating that
85:29 - Dynamic mesh updating the vertices that
85:31 - should be very easy so it's quite
85:33 - annoying to not have a built-in way as
85:36 - far as I know again I haven't tried it
85:38 - but if you do but basically trails are
85:41 - really just meshes and you can very
85:43 - easily create thousands of meshes update
85:45 - vertices on dots so it requires an
85:47 - interesting uh different way of
85:50 - implementing it but hopefully that can
85:52 - definitely quite work
85:54 - asset makers take an idea of Trail R for
85:56 - Dots yeah I guess that would be a good
85:58 - idea cuz I have no idea when uh when oh
86:01 - Trail R Works in dots oh doesn't oh okay
86:04 - so if so then that is awesome so is the
86:07 - issue just in terms of performance oh
86:09 - okay so yeah like I said I haven't yet
86:11 - uh researched that oh crap researched oh
86:15 - no no no no okay let me just let me do
86:18 - some healing so I don't die uh yeah cuz
86:20 - I have
86:22 - no okay that was is way too optimistic
86:26 - trying to take down that castle by
86:28 - myself that was definitely quite
86:31 - tricky okay I need
86:34 - to generate more converts gold into
86:36 - units faster okay so yeah I've got to
86:41 - upgrade this guy can I upgrade this guy
86:44 - oh that one just holds more units uh
86:50 - okay me is really just Dynamic mesh yeah
86:53 - exactly so yeah moving the vertices
86:55 - yourself is annoying but it can be done
86:57 - so yeah so if it is Implement by dots
87:00 - I'm very curious to to try out and see
87:02 - exactly what is the uh limitation for it
87:07 - yeah how do you organize accur packs do
87:10 - you copy the items you need into
87:12 - dedicated folders in your project if so
87:13 - how do you handle updates and
87:14 - dependencies uh for me usually the thing
87:17 - that I do is basically import the entire
87:18 - asset pack onto a separate project then
87:21 - I basically export a Unity package on
87:23 - just on just uh the things that I need
87:25 - and then basally so I made a video on
87:28 - that but I'm trying to remember what was
87:29 - the name
87:32 - uh oh crap what did I call it it was
87:35 - like keep your project there you go keep
87:37 - your project clean with no unused assets
87:39 - so basically that's my process basically
87:41 - import like a giant asset pack onto a
87:43 - separate project that just has the
87:45 - assets then I pick up the one or two
87:46 - prefabs that I want and I export just
87:48 - that onto my thing so yeah in terms of
87:52 - updating yeah that's uh usually I just
87:54 - get normally uh Vision things so I
87:56 - normally don't do too much updating but
87:58 - if I did then yeah I I guess I would do
87:59 - the same thing so basically update it
88:01 - there and then uh copy it back and in
88:05 - terms of organizing I don't know if that
88:07 - was also what you were asking but uh
88:10 - asset
88:12 - store.com uh in terms of organizing
88:14 - Assets in case you buy assets from lots
88:16 - of plac oh yeah by the way this thing is
88:17 - still live like if you not asset s asset
88:21 - inventory if you like me have a bunch of
88:24 - of assets from various humble modles and
88:26 - so on and you want to organize how you
88:28 - keep track of all those assets that you
88:29 - bought from various places then I can
88:31 - high recommend this asset I've picked
88:32 - this one up and it's really awesome you
88:34 - can basically import all the N packages
88:36 - that you bought in in various places
88:38 - like for example the cinti store is
88:40 - currently having a a sale so if you buy
88:43 - things over here then you can import
88:44 - them into the asset inventory and that
88:47 - basically helps you manage all kinds of
88:49 - things and actually C store I think this
88:53 - is the link so in case you want to buy
88:55 - any low poly acids then check out that
88:58 - that link that's my affiliate link so if
89:00 - you pick up anything I get a nice
89:02 - commission and you get some really
89:03 - awesome assets so yeah those are all
89:07 - really nice is there genre you do not
89:10 - enjoy playing uh I would say uh puzzle
89:14 - games that are way too difficult
89:16 - basically I suck at puzzle games so for
89:19 - me if it is something very very
89:20 - difficult very complex then I'm
89:22 - definitely not going to enjoy it so yeah
89:25 - puzzle games I suck at them I'm not good
89:27 - at thinking about it and oh I did not
89:31 - know why did I did I I don't know why
89:34 - the beginning of the game is being so
89:35 - difficult so so yeah puzzle games where
89:36 - I suck the witness I haven't tried it
89:39 - but yeah I assume when I play it it will
89:41 - probably not be a super enjoyable
89:43 - experience although I've also heard that
89:44 - one starts with a very nice smooth uh
89:47 - difficulty curve so yeah it kind of
89:49 - depends on how intense Oh no I got three
89:52 - squads nice it kind of depends on how
89:53 - int in is the difficulty curve cuz like
89:55 - for example portal I really love portal
89:57 - it's one of the best games of all time
89:59 - and technically it's kind of a puzzle
90:00 - game but it's not a very intense puzzle
90:02 - game but all those things that are like
90:05 - there's tons of like uh platformer
90:07 - puzzle games yeah I really do not enjoy
90:09 - those just because I really suck at them
90:11 - it's really difficult so yeah for me
90:14 - usually that's the thing or things like
90:16 - for example visual novels with a ton of
90:18 - reading ton of stuff like I don't
90:20 - enjoy uh doing a ton of L reading in in
90:24 - game so those are roughly the genres
90:27 - that I don't enjoy but at the same time
90:29 - there are so many that I do enjoy so
90:31 - it's not really a problem winess is hard
90:34 - to 100% oh yeah I imagine to get to 100%
90:37 - that would be extremely difficult
90:40 - yeah oh there you go nice they took him
90:42 - out let's see if now I can finally take
90:44 - this guy
90:46 - out
90:52 - crap don't me group them up together and
90:55 - it's the warwind boom
91:00 - nice okay good all of you when you are
91:03 - done go
91:07 - there uh where was
91:10 - I when you finally make your build do un
91:12 - not remove all the
91:13 - unused uh yep it does so what I was
91:16 - saying what I was saying a while ago
91:18 - about importing onto a separate project
91:19 - and then come back that is really just
91:21 - to help you keep yourself organized as
91:23 - you are building game because yeah when
91:24 - you make a build it does not matter if
91:26 - you have gigabytes of Assets in your
91:28 - project they will not be included in the
91:29 - build so it's really just something to
91:31 - organize yourself as you are building
91:33 - the game hey Christian hey thanks so
91:35 - much for the uh super sticker real nice
91:37 - real nice thank you yeah thank you to
91:40 - you all right uh oh crap I'm almost
91:44 - about to
91:45 - [Music]
91:49 - die go go boom nice that was cool
91:55 - okay I need the a little bit of
92:04 - healing
92:07 - okay a crap no no no boom
92:12 - nice oh man this is being really
92:22 - difficult woo
92:27 - [Music]
92:31 - go o wait this was a tricky where oh my
92:36 - guys decided to go to the other side
92:38 - that is why I'm alone
92:42 - here okay oh come on they've got a bunch
92:45 - more my guys are constantly dying no
92:48 - stop defend oh crap no no no get done
92:59 - okay yeah I really need a bigger Army in
93:02 - order to fight these guys a
93:05 - crap no no no no don't hit my
93:10 - guys okay this I don't think this is
93:12 - going to end well
93:14 - [Music]
93:25 - oh yeah I think I really need to no no
93:27 - no
93:31 - no and there's another guy coming in so
93:33 - nope also going to lose this one
93:37 - no oh the game is more difficult than I
93:40 - remember H that's
93:43 - fun by boom nice that was
93:52 - cool boom
93:57 - nice yeah I won't be able to take down
94:00 - this guy so
94:05 - difficult
94:08 - no okay so I think I probably need to uh
94:12 - give more backup to my guys so I so I
94:14 - don't keep uh doing
94:18 - that
94:20 - uh get much thought to games and
94:23 - influences other than video games chess
94:25 - Sudoku board games D andd Etc that is
94:28 - interesting uh I mean everything can be
94:30 - an an inspiration so for me I don't
94:33 - necessarily play many board games so not
94:35 - quite that but anytime I'll watch some
94:36 - kind of interesting movie some kind of
94:39 - interesting uh show I always think about
94:42 - turning some of those elements into
94:44 - gamees so yeah that would be uh yeah in
94:47 - terms of board games not so much but
94:49 - pretty much anything that I do I'm
94:50 - constantly thinking of game ideas game
94:52 - things so yeah definitely inspiration
94:54 - can come from pretty much anywhere so
94:57 - yeah ever make a mod for a game nope not
95:00 - really uh I did make a few things with
95:03 - uh with hammer back in the day I made a
95:05 - few Uh custom Counter Strike Maps but no
95:08 - never made anything too intense so it's
95:11 - uh something it's been three years since
95:14 - I started working on un project before I
95:15 - knew the size grown to 250 gigs wow
95:18 - wondering should I delete the library
95:20 - depends if you are using it or not I
95:22 - mean but yeah that that definitely means
95:24 - you've got a mountain of uh a mountain
95:27 - of assets within that project so are you
95:29 - using all of them I'm guessing probably
95:32 - not but at the same time trying to
95:34 - figure out which ones you're using I
95:36 - think yeah I actually don't know if the
95:39 - the asset that I was showing you a while
95:40 - ago asset inventory if that one does
95:43 - does tell you what assets you're
95:45 - currently using I actually don't know
95:46 - but you can use the uh un build size
95:51 - report I always forget where this one is
95:54 - but Unity has a it's not a build
95:59 - resport basically when you make a build
96:01 - you can look in
96:04 - the is it this no that's the
96:07 - package
96:11 - uh build report I think just build
96:18 - report basically when you make a build
96:21 - you can go onto your editor folder and
96:23 - you can see there's a text found there
96:25 - so showing the logs for the uh for the
96:28 - build and it's going to show all the s
96:30 - that you're using and all thing so I
96:32 - guess yeah build report but but I'm
96:35 - looking for the uh the text file so I
96:38 - don't know but yeah I'm guessing you're
96:40 - not actually using those those 250 gigs
96:43 - so yeah definitely try to do game is
96:45 - addicting oh yeah I'm I'm glad you're
96:47 - enjoying it so it's
96:49 - definitely I'm enjoying playing it again
96:52 - so yeah
96:58 - you make good money from Dev uh yeah I
97:01 - mean it took me a very long time like I
97:03 - started making Flash games in 2008 and
97:05 - took me like four or five years until I
97:08 - got to the point where I was making
97:09 - minimum wage minimum wage here in
97:11 - Portugal so I was making like uh 400
97:13 - bucks a month so yeah definitely took me
97:15 - quite a while but yeah that was since
97:18 - I've been doing this for I mean since
97:20 - 2008 that was what like 17 years
97:24 - I don't know I I can't do math now but
97:26 - yeah it's been a very long time since
97:28 - I've been doing Game Dev so
97:30 - yeah through that time my definitely
97:33 - took me quite a long time to to grow my
97:36 - skills and start earning enough to pay
97:38 - for uh my own living but yeah nowadays
97:41 - thankfully things are going quite
97:44 - well going try Unity 6 with all new
97:46 - features making a video about that I
97:48 - definitely would like to that's one of
97:50 - the things that I oh that's one of the
97:51 - things that I have on my to do list but
97:54 - at the same time right now I'm so busy
97:55 - trying to do research for the dots
97:58 - course so so that's on my queue but not
98:01 - sure if SL when I'll be able to get it
98:03 - but yeah I I very much want to try out a
98:07 - crap no no no no no I very much want to
98:10 - try out the uh new graphics features cuz
98:12 - I haven't used them yet and they look
98:14 - quite interesting so oh no no no no
98:19 - no uh so yeah I very much would like to
98:22 - try that out and see how they work
98:24 - because at least on paper they do seem
98:27 - very
98:32 - useful uh are you planning your next
98:34 - team game uh not yet although I would
98:36 - like to go go back to Total World
98:38 - Liberation uh later on this year yeah
98:41 - thanks so much Christian for the super
98:43 - chat um later this year total World
98:48 - Liberation Liberation there you go so
98:51 - yeah I'm still a huge fan of this idea
98:54 - oh look at that Rel dat yeah I'm not
98:56 - sure it's going to be uh in 24 but yeah
99:00 - I I announced this game like over a year
99:02 - ago but yeah then I had to switch gears
99:05 - I had to switch into something a bit
99:06 - more simple but yeah I I'm still a big
99:09 - fan of the of this game idea the whole
99:11 - thing So the plan is on the later half
99:13 - of this year like I don't oh crap am I
99:16 - dying y from uh on the later half of
99:19 - this year to get back into that game so
99:22 - hopefully uh I won't be able to do that
99:24 - cuz that would be that would be quite
99:28 - fun
99:29 - [Music]
99:33 - um are you doing good from games revenue
99:36 - or more from YouTube I mean for the past
99:38 - oh there you go uh oh I got so many
99:41 - points uh for the past I don't know like
99:44 - three or four years I've been focusing
99:46 - much more on YouTube than than on Game
99:48 - Dev so basically when I started this
99:50 - channel back in 2018 it was uh like 100%
99:54 - my income from from there and 0% from
99:56 - YouTube and over time since I've been
99:58 - focusing more on YouTube it's kind of
100:00 - been flipping around so but nowadays uh
100:02 - my games still sell uh quite a little
100:04 - bit which is actually fun uh so so yeah
100:09 - nowadays definitely uh make more from
100:11 - the YouTube side like uh YouTube
100:14 - affiliate links courses and so on
100:16 - nowadays I make more from that than from
100:18 - my games with my games they still that's
100:20 - the great thing about when you make a
100:21 - game is basically the game stays there
100:23 - for for a oh the passive bonuses nice uh
100:26 - when you make a game basically the game
100:28 - stays there it continues making money
100:30 - for a long time automatically so that's
100:32 - actually one of the one of the fun
100:34 - things oh let me upgrade that's
100:36 - nice uh so yeah okay let me just I've
100:40 - got yeah let me upgrade Spike to the max
100:42 - cuz Ione like Spike it's simple and
100:44 - interesting oh let me also upgrade the
100:47 - hry or the Earth shatter cuz this can
100:50 - actually damage buildings nice that's
100:52 - okay that's exactly what I want
100:54 - nice how show that kind of Clips is it
100:56 - video files are you talking about the
100:58 - upgrade uh yep that is the video
101:02 - player empty video player where you can
101:04 - basically play a video and you can play
101:06 - it anywhere so in this case I'm
101:08 - basically playing the video in some UI
101:10 - component so so I recorded some video of
101:13 - the various upgrades and all and all
101:15 - those things that they do then yeah just
101:17 - have a video player and surrendering the
101:18 - video directly on that thing so that is
101:20 - actually something that is really
101:21 - awesome I really enjoyed uh making that
101:24 - when I made the uh the upgrade system
101:26 - because took me quite a while to get
101:27 - this UI and yeah when I when I figured
101:30 - out that I could use a little video in
101:31 - order to Showcase what the upgrades
101:33 - actually do that definitely helped quite
101:35 - a bit so yeah definitely video player if
101:37 - you don't know about it definitely use
101:38 - it and I'm pretty sure I have a lecture
101:40 - on it in my ultimate unity overview
101:42 - course so if you have this one then go
101:44 - ahead and check out because I'm pretty
101:46 - sure I do have a lecture on
101:48 - the video player don't I pretty sure I
101:51 - do video play yep I do so there you go
101:54 - lecture 16 on the video player super
101:56 - simple to use and super helpful super
102:01 - useful hard is create something
102:04 - multiplayer in dots that's a good
102:05 - question I haven't yet looked into uh
102:08 - net code for game objects I mean they
102:10 - made an entire tool stack specifically
102:11 - for that specifically for making
102:12 - multiplayer with net uh specially for
102:14 - making multiplayer with
102:17 - entities so technically they are working
102:19 - very hard on making a tool for that
102:20 - making the tool nice and usable but I
102:22 - have haven't uh tried it myself so I
102:25 - don't know the specifics I have no idea
102:27 - if it is super easy super hard but
102:29 - hopefully it should actually be uh quite
102:33 - quite usable oh that's a nice map okay
102:36 - let's go all those guys go like
102:38 - that uh I thing after completing your 10
102:42 - hours which course will you recommend me
102:46 - uh if you want to oh let me just
102:49 - pause if you want something on more of
102:52 - the uh more advanced level then I would
102:56 - definitely say check out my turn based
102:57 - strategy course that one is really
102:58 - awesome if you want something more
103:00 - intermediate SL advanc but if you want
103:02 - to stick on the beginner side then I
103:03 - would just recommend you just do a ton
103:05 - of uh small projects so I always
103:07 - recommend build something like Flappy
103:09 - Bird something like Missile Command
103:11 - something like Pac-Man Space Invaders do
103:13 - those super basic games and if you make
103:15 - those you will gain quite a lot of put a
103:17 - lot of knowledge so yeah if you don't
103:19 - have money then definitely go ahead and
103:20 - do that and go ahead and watch my my uh
103:23 - uh C uh free videos if you want
103:26 - something so
103:28 - C so go watch I've got the intermediate
103:30 - and the beginner the complete courses
103:33 - all the video lectures are free over
103:34 - there on YouTube so if you want
103:36 - something definitely go ahead and follow
103:38 - that
103:42 - one okay let me
103:45 - just right oh the village
103:48 - Captain all
103:50 - right take out all of you boom nice and
103:55 - all of you go like that and now I've got

104:31 - button com I haven't played it yet so I
104:33 - don't know but uh I'm pretty sure there
104:36 - are many combo systems so I definitely
104:38 - wouldn't say that but yeah it's
104:40 - something that I really enjoy I
104:42 - definitely enjoy making the combos from
104:44 - here I mean I think my original idea was
104:47 - like from uh fighting games which always
104:49 - have interesting combos so so yeah it's
104:52 - definitely something something oh look
104:53 - that reinforcement uh yeah if you want
104:56 - to make something more interesting
104:57 - definitely make a lot of uh combo
105:01 - systems always take inspiration from
105:03 - pretty much anywhere you can find it
105:06 - okay my X let me just boom
105:09 - [Music]

105:53 - oh what is the 20 Game Challenge is that
105:56 - making 20 games that sounds like a very
105:59 - interesting challenge yeah I mean making
106:02 - 20 games will definitely teach you quite
106:03 - a
106:04 - lot uh cuz yeah basically I'm big
106:08 - believer in experience constantly
106:10 - learning new things so yeah if you make
106:12 - 20 games you will gain a massive amount
106:14 - of experience so
106:16 - definitely that definitely sounds like
106:18 - an interesting challenge okay let's go
106:20 - ahead send them all all of you go up oh

107:46 - boom
107:47 - nice come on take out that guy
107:54 - oh no no no no no no oh
107:57 - crap oh boy that was
108:02 - annoying um playing the game for almost
108:04 - 1 hour is only worth it nice I'm glad
108:07 - that I'm glad you're enjoying the G
108:09 - that's
108:10 - cool
108:17 - uh you ever triy playing lethon company
108:20 - uh no not not really I mean I my playing
108:24 - habits are very random so it's really
108:26 - hard to find something that depends on
108:29 - other people but yeah i' I've seen about
108:31 - the game does look like a very
108:33 - interesting design very very compelling
108:35 - so I mean definitely a lot of people
108:37 - love it so it can definitely work oh you
108:40 - cannot construct over map buildings okay
108:42 - I forgot I forgot about this feature
108:46 - okay oh yeah I can create the trets and
108:49 - the mons again oh
108:51 - nice okay
108:54 - oh yeah to oh crap I probably should not
108:56 - have built a tret
108:58 - there but oh that my guys took over the
109:01 - region well that's nice that's
109:04 - cool okay yeah they took cover but this
109:07 - thing is now going to be attack so let
109:09 - me actually I got to clear up these guys
109:11 - quickly so that they don't take over my
109:15 - castle do you provide mentorship uh not
109:18 - really I'm already insanely busy with so
109:20 - many things I would love to cuz in idea
109:24 - uh in theory it sounds really awesome
109:25 - being able to actually Mentor someone
109:28 - but yeah finding the time for it is
109:30 - quite tricky I'm already super busy with
109:32 - so many things that I want to do so
109:35 - doing something that is one-on-one with
109:36 - a single person it sounds really awesome
109:38 - in theory but yeah finding as with so
109:41 - many things finding time for it is
109:43 - always the tricky part oh nice okay
109:47 - cool there was another one right there
109:53 - okay let's take out this guy so that my
109:54 - Outpost is nice and
109:57 - safe when you play your own games what
109:59 - is something that you know would do
110:01 - better or change in death terms that's a
110:04 - very good question uh I don't know cuz
110:08 - honestly I'm really enjoying playing
110:09 - this game so I don't know I mean I think
110:12 - I would uh I think I would improve like
110:15 - adding a bit more life to the levels
110:17 - like the levels are a bit too empty like
110:20 - it's got some the Sprites are nice but
110:22 - they're a bit too empty I mean there's
110:24 - just some random bushes in the
110:26 - background everything is green
110:28 - everything is super basic so I would
110:29 - definitely add a little bit more variety
110:32 - on there over here on this Victory
110:34 - screen I would probably make it a bit
110:36 - more flashy for all the all the bars
110:38 - increasing so I add a little bit of
110:39 - Polish onto that but yeah I don't know
110:42 - on this game I'm still very happy with
110:44 - how it came out nowadays so yeah I'm not
110:47 - sure I would change too many things on
110:49 - on this one I mean the main thing is
110:51 - nowadays I would probably do it
110:53 - in not necessarily in 3D but do that 2
110:56 - and a2d style so I would make the
110:58 - characters still in 2D but put the
111:00 - Waring 3D add some really nice uh depth
111:04 - field uh Shader effect and I think that
111:06 - would actually make the game look quite
111:08 - a lot better and send out quite a bit so
111:10 - but yeah there's always many things you
111:12 - can improve on pretty much any game you
111:14 - make if you come back to it in the
111:16 - future you can always think of ways that
111:18 - could be done better and hopefully over
111:21 - time you are gaining the skill so your
111:22 - Gam are constantly hopefully improving
111:24 - so
111:26 - yeah um I'm being honest the UI visuals
111:29 - are one of the weakest aspect in your
111:31 - games mostly black boxes yeah I'm
111:33 - definitely not skilled at uh creating UI
111:37 - can I
111:38 - just okay let me give some units just to
111:41 - make sure this one doesn't have uh yeah
111:43 - UI is definitely not my strong point so
111:45 - for me yeah UI is definitely usually
111:47 - very big like over here it's just a nice
111:49 - texture that I I don't know that I
111:50 - picked up from some random asset pack in
111:52 - order to get the in order to get oh crap
111:55 - there are no more units
111:58 - uh just uh oh crap they're attacking
112:01 - that no no no
112:02 - no
112:04 - uh hey you stop attacking that uh so
112:08 - yeah but that also comes with uh my lack
112:12 - of uh knowledge my lack of ability of
112:15 - being able to see what is what looks
112:17 - good what does not look good
112:20 - so so yeah in theory I can I can
112:23 - definitely see that my UI is not as good
112:25 - as many other games but I don't have
112:28 - enough of a critical artist Eye in order
112:30 - to be able to see what I would change
112:32 - about it so yeah that is definitely one
112:34 - of those things where collaborating with
112:36 - an artist can help quite a lot because
112:38 - it's someone else who has a different
112:40 - View and can definitely see things that
112:43 - I can't really see for myself
112:46 - [Music]
112:50 - so okay most
112:53 - woo
112:57 - nice
112:58 - uh I want see M you offering to do
113:01 - translation for Norwegian for free I
113:03 - don't know if you saw the email I sent
113:04 - to you even though it was a long while
113:06 - uh I don't know I maybe I saw it maybe
113:10 - not I don't know it's a I get so many
113:12 - emails I try to go through all of them
113:14 - but yeah there are some that every once
113:16 - in a while I
113:17 - don't uh I read them and then I forget
113:20 - that I read them and then yeah but in
113:24 - terms of
113:25 - localization crap uh in terms of
113:28 - localization I normally try to keep a
113:31 - bunch of languages so that's the thing
113:33 - is that even if someone offers to do it
113:35 - for free having to set up all that can
113:38 - be quite a bit tricky
113:40 - so uh so yeah localization is a bit of a
113:44 - tricky thing okay hey again oh what time
113:47 - is it oh it's almost two oh crap I got
113:50 - to go eat lunch and take my dogs outside
113:53 - okay so just Le bit
113:59 - more
114:00 - [Music]
114:02 - uh at your ultimate M overview nice but
114:06 - it's on me is there a way I can transfer
114:08 - this to your website account uh there's
114:10 - no automatic way but send me an email uh
114:14 - and I will see so yeah
114:17 - definitely uh use the contact form or
114:19 - just email me directly the contact form
114:21 - on my on my website so you can go up
114:23 - here and let me know your email and then
114:26 - I will uh try to see because yeah I'm
114:28 - pretty sure that I can manually do that
114:30 - so
114:32 - yeah
114:35 - uh interestes in data management is the
114:37 - world map scene information always
114:38 - loaded as a Bas scene uh I don't
114:41 - remember the specifics for how I did it
114:43 - but yep it is always running CU if I if
114:46 - I go into a fight and I open up the map
114:49 - there I can see exactly what is going on
114:50 - on the Overworld so there's now that
114:52 - little 20 is coming out is going to
114:54 - reinforce that 42 is coming in so on so
114:57 - basically the entire world is constantly
114:59 - running but honestly I don't remember
115:00 - exactly how I implemented
115:02 - this I don't remember if I did kind of
115:05 - like I did on dink Guardians where I
115:06 - have just basic SE classes I don't know
115:09 - if that's how I implemented but yeah
115:11 - basically the entire world let's go
115:13 - worldwind boom nice uh so yeah I don't
115:17 - remember exactly how I implemented it
115:19 - but yeah I'm guessing all the logic is
115:21 - running all the time in order to be able
115:22 - to have those so
115:28 - yeah um I prefer the plan UI a lot of
115:30 - games now put too much info into UI yeah
115:33 - when it comes to UI design you can
115:34 - definitely go way to overboard and yeah
115:36 - there are some AAA games that have so
115:38 - many awesome animations but it looks
115:41 - really awesome but then it's very not
115:43 - very uh usable so yeah with UI you
115:46 - definitely have to balance that give the
115:48 - player a lot of information but don't
115:50 - overwhelm them with tons of things but
115:51 - also make it look good so yeah that that
115:54 - is that is why UI designer is an actual
115:57 - uh discipline it's an actual thing that
115:59 - people focus on doing just that all the
116:02 - time so
116:08 - yeah currently following your kitchen
116:10 - chaos course plus multiplier nice
116:12 - planing to watch your turnbas readyy
116:13 - course oh that's that's awesome yeah I
116:16 - that's a great learning plan and I hope
116:18 - you're learning quite a lot nice uh let
116:22 - me just crap isn't it
116:26 - triet oh I forgot that I had to manually
116:29 - build it I totally forgot about that
116:31 - okay let me just take out these
116:33 - guys see now talking a while ago about
116:36 - uh the things that I would change well
116:39 - right now playing the game I haven't
116:40 - played this game in like seven years so
116:41 - I don't remember all the mechanics and I
116:43 - totally did not notice how apparently I
116:45 - need to manually build the truchet so
116:47 - that is why that thing was not building
116:49 - I thought it was just time base but nope
116:50 - I have to manually build it
116:53 - so so yeah clearly that means that part
116:56 - is not very well explained because well
116:58 - because I didn't think about it I didn't
116:59 - think that I had to manually build it so
117:02 - I would definitely add some kind of
117:03 - indicator saying you need to build this
117:06 - especially if the player does not build
117:07 - for for some time at a little notice
117:10 - saying you have to interact with it in
117:12 - order to build it okay let me
117:15 - actually Army size yeah I think that
117:17 - would be nice I got two more oh building
117:21 - speed well that would be good
117:23 - oh and the building upgrades nice I
117:25 - forgot about that yeah right cuz I made
117:27 - different
117:29 - uh different units oh SC oh I can't
117:32 - afford that one so just minion
117:39 - upgrades uh let's go with the flurry so
117:42 - I can attack all the
117:45 - knights okay let me go into that one and
117:48 - just give away all these and
117:50 - hopefully okay that guy now that guy is
117:52 - chasing me okay fine let's
117:55 - fight okay I got to go in like 5 or 10
117:58 - minutes so I'm already way too late and
118:00 - I haven't had lunch yet it's already 2
118:05 - [Music]
118:09 - p.m. no no no nice go go go boom nice
118:18 - [Music]
118:25 - okay nice that was
118:34 - fast thing are you from Portugal so do
118:36 - you love Christian Ronald I'm actually
118:39 - not that much into football but sure
118:43 - he's one of the most uh successful
118:46 - football players in the world so yeah I
118:47 - guess a lot of people like him but yeah
118:49 - I'm not much into football so don't only
118:52 - have a a specific opinion on him
118:59 - yeah been helpful for Designing UI
119:01 - making mockups and they'll be
119:02 - Illustrated before important them in
119:04 - yeah definitely doing some prototype of
119:06 - the UI before you actually spend the
119:08 - time to build it that can definitely
119:10 - save you quite a lot of time so that is
119:11 - definitely a worthwhile
119:15 - thing right in the middle and warwind
119:18 - boom nice
119:20 - [Music]
119:26 - boom
119:27 - [Music]
119:34 - nice
119:38 - niceoo I only got seven guys left
119:44 - well
119:47 - [Music]
119:50 - boom when Rel the the advanced section
119:52 - of the C course I'm not sure I'm trying
119:54 - to right now split my time between doing
119:58 - research for the upcoming dots course
119:59 - and working on the advanced section for
120:01 - the cop course so I'm kind of jumping
120:03 - back and forth between those two so I
120:06 - don't know but I definitely plan to have
120:08 - uh another
120:09 - update I don't I was going to say by the
120:11 - end of this month but it's already like
120:13 - the 20th so I'm not sure but yeah
120:15 - definitely basally for the next update I
120:17 - want to cover specifically uh
120:19 - multi-threading in C which is a very
120:22 - tough topic so yeah that one is
120:24 - definitely going to take quite a while
120:25 - to do a bunch of research on
120:29 - uh so yeah I don't know on exact
120:32 - timeline but I definitely very much uh
120:35 - want to get to it where are these guys
120:37 - constantly ah he destroyed my my
120:40 - cier okay let me destroy this guy
120:47 - then uh where was
120:50 - I did you make the Sprites for the rock
120:53 - trees building yourself nope I hired an
120:54 - artist to do all this so basically this
120:58 - uh oh yeah now I've got four teams
121:00 - that's nice uh basically I hired an
121:04 - artist for this game for doing oh can I
121:06 - no I can't uh hir an artist so all these
121:10 - uh Sprites for the for the the
121:13 - background the trees the main character
121:15 - I did do the ones for the minion
121:17 - characters so the tiny characters those
121:18 - are really uh super simple so I did
121:20 - those myself okay let me just do an
121:22 - inspire a y y a boom
121:26 - nice uh so yeah I did do those but for
121:30 - the for the tent I could not draw a tent
121:32 - like this for the little uh uh fire pit
121:35 - sort of thing for all the characters all
121:37 - the weapons all the ammo and so on for
121:40 - all these character sprites yep these
121:42 - were all contracted an artist to work on
121:45 - and and I'm very happy with the result
121:47 - yeah I think visually this game is one
121:50 - of the best games that I've made so I'm
121:53 - definitely quite happy with that okay
121:54 - put all in there and let's
121:58 - see can I promote my YouTube here uh
122:01 - nope cuz YouTube automatically deletes
122:03 - links so I would say don't try that
122:05 - because YouTube might might do something
122:08 - to your account YouTube really does not
122:10 - like links in the
122:12 - comments oh boy this is starting to

124:15 - lot all right so yeah it's already to
124:17 - yeah I really gotta go I gotta say I
124:19 - really enjoyed playing this game so
124:22 - yeah this was definitely definitely fun
124:24 - make sure to save I mean it Autos saves
124:26 - but still yeah that was definitely quite
124:28 - fun could your grid system be used for
124:30 - procedural 3D match generation yep
124:32 - definitely I mean uh you can use it my
124:35 - mouse
124:37 - uh yeah you can definitely use it to do
124:39 - some like uh wave function collapse this
124:43 - is one way of doing procedural
124:45 - generation and this one is specifically
124:47 - based on having grids and position grids
124:49 - with different positions and then you
124:51 - randomize all kinds of things so you
124:52 - could definitely use this with with a
124:54 - grid system and for making it 3D yeah
124:56 - you can definitely have multiple grids
124:58 - stacked on top of one another and you
125:00 - could do all kinds of things so yeah I'm
125:03 - a huge fan of grd systems they are very
125:05 - capable very uh possible to do all kinds
125:08 - of things so yeah okay okay so yeah I
125:11 - really got to go cuz it's already 2 p.m.
125:13 - so anyways if any of you want to play

125:42 - game design aspects like how do you
125:43 - create systems and balance them the
125:45 - answer is tons of iteration so I

125:52 - you should pin a comment oh that's a
125:53 - good idea I actually totally forgot that

126:09 - things so yeah okay so yeah I really got
126:12 - to go so I hope you all enjoy this uh
