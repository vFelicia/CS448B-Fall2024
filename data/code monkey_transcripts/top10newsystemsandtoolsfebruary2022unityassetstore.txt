00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - the assessor is full of awesome tools
00:04 - and asks to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - february 202. this one is a list of paid
00:12 - systems and tools in the last video i
00:14 - already covered all the best three new
00:15 - assets so go watch that if you haven't
00:17 - seen it in the next video i'll be
00:19 - covering the top passes and effects let
00:21 - me know which one of these you're most
00:22 - interested in and i might do a detailed
00:23 - review on it as always there's links to
00:25 - the ask in the description and as a
00:26 - bonus you can use the coupon code
00:28 - monkey10 to get 10 off your order also
00:30 - one quick note here usually in these
00:32 - videos i hide the prices for the assets
00:35 - i do that for two reasons one it's
00:37 - because the price is local so what i see
00:39 - on my screen over here in portugal is
00:41 - different to what someone in the us or
00:43 - in india would see and secondly because
00:45 - assets go on and off sale so sometimes
00:47 - when i record these videos the assets
00:49 - are still having their launch discount
00:51 - which will likely be over by the time
00:52 - the video is published so for those two
00:54 - reasons i tend to hide the price to
00:56 - avoid showing you any incorrect
00:57 - information
00:58 - so pretty much if you like the asset you
01:00 - just click on the link to check the
01:01 - price in your own country at that exact
01:03 - time but i have gotten several comments
01:06 - that seem to think there's some
01:07 - nefarious reason for why i do that i
01:09 - don't even really know what possible
01:11 - evil reason i could have for hiding the
01:12 - prices but regardless of my intent some
01:15 - people think it's shady so i guess if i
01:17 - have to choose between people seeing
01:18 - prices that are somewhat incorrect or
01:20 - having people assume that i'm doing
01:22 - something with evil intent i guess i'll
01:24 - go with the first option so all of that
01:25 - to say that i will no longer hide them
01:27 - so be aware that the prices and
01:29 - discounts that you see in the video are
01:30 - not necessarily what you will see when
01:32 - you click on the asset link
01:34 - alright so starting off with an
01:35 - interesting tool for iterating upon your
01:37 - animations it makes playing with ik
01:40 - super simple just move some sliders and
01:42 - easily move arms and legs or anything
01:45 - now this is not a tool for making
01:46 - animations from scratch instead it's for
01:49 - starting from something and making some
01:50 - changes to get the exact animation you
01:52 - want so for example you take a walking
01:54 - animation to create a walking tightrope
01:56 - animation or maybe an idle animation and
01:59 - you make it idle but carrying a box it's
02:01 - a really nice tool for your animation
02:02 - toolbox then here's one that is
02:04 - extremely important called feedback pro
02:07 - getting feedback from your players is
02:09 - essential to making a great game usually
02:11 - people handle that by asking the players
02:13 - to send an email but no one really does
02:14 - that so this one is a super useful
02:17 - window that you can place directly in
02:18 - your game and then it just sends all the
02:21 - data to wherever you want you can easily
02:23 - include a screenshot and system info
02:25 - along with any other game that you need
02:27 - it's all very well documented and you
02:29 - can export that data to anywhere you
02:31 - want something like discord slack or
02:33 - just json if you want to have some great
02:35 - looking ui shadows look at this one the
02:37 - built-in ui shando is nice but it's very
02:40 - simple it's a solid shadow just rendered
02:42 - on all four sides this one is much much
02:44 - softer works on all shapes and sizes and
02:47 - you can also change the color to make it
02:49 - look like a glow instead of a shadow
02:51 - then over here is an interesting one
02:53 - it's all about hiding data directly
02:55 - inside an image i believe this is called
02:57 - steganography it's a fun concept and
02:59 - this asset makes it easy to use
03:02 - this can be especially great for modding
03:04 - so you can encode the mod data directly
03:06 - inside the mod screenshot
03:08 - and then you can easily share that image
03:10 - so that anyone can load that mod also
03:12 - the ui for some reason reminds me of old
03:14 - school theme so that's fun next up if
03:16 - you want to place down some buildings
03:18 - kind of like playing the sims check out
03:19 - this one you can place down walls floors
03:22 - doors windows and more you can swap out
03:24 - the marginal parts with your own custom
03:26 - ones
03:27 - also the developer says this is pretty
03:28 - much in early access the basics are
03:30 - there but it will keep getting updates
03:32 - over time then if you want a complete
03:34 - game template here is a colony simulator
03:36 - it's packed with tons of features it's
03:38 - got building crafting resource gathering
03:41 - there's equipment and weapons there's
03:43 - objectives tectories factories and tons
03:45 - more so if you want to make a quick
03:47 - prototype then this can be quite useful
03:49 - or maybe you have a 2d game and you want
03:51 - to have some destruction then here is
03:53 - sprite breaker a while ago i covered
03:55 - rayfire which is an excellent
03:57 - destruction tool this is kind of like
03:59 - that but for 2d
04:00 - break any sprite you want into as many
04:02 - pieces as you want you can slice them
04:04 - automatically or manually define the
04:06 - slices and it automatically applies
04:08 - physics to all the parts so everything
04:10 - falls apart then if you want to make
04:11 - some procedural buildings look at this
04:13 - one you can create any shape apply
04:16 - whatever modifiers you want to get the
04:17 - windows doors and lights so you can make
04:20 - some modern skyscrapers or some really
04:22 - fancy buildings by just using the
04:24 - included demo assets you could already
04:25 - create a very massive very convincing
04:27 - city up next here's a simple one for
04:30 - analyzing the size of your project
04:32 - you can easily find which files are
04:34 - taking the most space so you can either
04:35 - remove them or compress them it's one of
04:38 - those that does just one thing and does
04:39 - very well and for another complete game
04:41 - template here is an rpg editor this one
04:44 - is version three it's been development
04:46 - and getting constant updates ever since
04:48 - 2010 so it's really solid and packed
04:50 - with tons of features experience
04:52 - turn-based battles or real-time combat
04:55 - it's got all of these systems you expect
04:57 - class factions loot research and more
04:59 - features extensive documentation and
05:01 - some tutorials to easily get started
05:03 - alright so those are my top 10 new tools
05:05 - and systems on the unt assessor for
