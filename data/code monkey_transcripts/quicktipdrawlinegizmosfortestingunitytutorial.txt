00:02 - hi there this is a quick tip for how to
00:04 - draw debug lines so as you build in your
00:07 - game you won't likely use debug log
00:09 - quite a lot it's very useful to show a
00:10 - message of something that's happening
00:12 - however in some cases it might be more
00:14 - useful to visually see something in the
00:16 - game instead of just looking at the
00:17 - console so for that you can use debug
00:19 - dot
00:20 - draw a line this lets you draw a line
00:21 - between two points so for example so for
00:26 - example this won't draw on line from 0 0
00:28 - to 30 50 painted in white and it won't
00:31 - be visible for a hundred seconds now
00:34 - first of all when you run the code you
00:35 - can see that nothing is actually visible
00:37 - that is because in order to see debug
00:39 - lines you need to go up here and enable
00:41 - gizmos and just like that there's our
00:43 - line it's going from zero zero to fifty
00:45 - fifty and don't vanish after a hundred
00:47 - seconds and yep the line is now gone
00:50 - okay great in here if you don't set any
00:52 - duration it will only be visible for one
00:55 - frame so that is very useful when using
00:57 - on an update so let's make a pearloid
01:00 - update so without any duration it will
01:06 - only be visible for one frame but since
01:08 - it's an update the next frame it won't
01:09 - draw again and so on and so on
01:10 - so with this we should be able to see a
01:13 - line being drawn from zero towards the
01:15 - mouse position and being visible every
01:18 - frame so let's see and yep there's the
01:20 - line as you can see it is constantly
01:22 - pointing towards the mouse one situation
01:24 - where this is very useful is for example
01:25 - to debug pathfinding
01:37 - so for example let's say you have a pet
01:40 - filing system which returns an array of
01:41 - vector threes containing the path that
01:43 - your unit won't follow and then second
01:46 - through the home path drawing lines so
01:47 - you can visually see where your unit
01:49 - Moore phone so for example just like
01:51 - that you would be able to see which path
01:53 - your unit would phone
01:54 - another great uses if you have some sort
01:57 - of quadrant system and you can use
01:58 - essentially draw four lines to be able
02:00 - to draw a square so just like that we
02:25 - have a simple function doing a drop
02:27 - wasn't it simply draws all four sides of
02:29 - a square and we run it on update and
02:31 - just like that we have a nice visual
02:34 - representation of a grid in our map and
02:36 - again we can just disable gizmos and
02:38 - everything looks perform and that's it
02:40 - hope you found this tip useful alright
02:42 - see you next time
