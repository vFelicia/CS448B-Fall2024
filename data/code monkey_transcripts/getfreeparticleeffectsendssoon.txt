00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and right now you can get three awesome
00:04 - particle facts completely for free and
00:06 - on top of that there's many other
00:07 - particle effects and other assets you
00:08 - can get for 50 off so for the free ones
00:11 - you've got the realistic particle
00:13 - effects it's got lots of interesting
00:15 - visuals a bunch of fire water all of
00:17 - them with a nice realistic scale
00:19 - then for something a bit more cartoony
00:21 - you've got the action rpg effects it's
00:24 - got lots of portals chess auras and so
00:26 - on and finally the aoe magic spells pack
00:29 - like name implies it's got lots of aoe
00:31 - spells so this one is perfect for any
00:33 - sort of fantasy game you can get these
00:35 - three commonly for free by using the
00:37 - coupon product on party all you need to
00:39 - do is just add them to your cart then
00:41 - during checkout apply the coupon in
00:43 - total will be zero this one is a pretty
00:45 - quick deal it ends already this weekend
00:47 - so definitely get it right away you can
00:49 - keep these assets forever personally i
00:51 - didn't have any of these three myself so
00:52 - i picked them up right away so go ahead
00:54 - and get them now but keep watching this
00:56 - video i'm going to show you how to
00:57 - upgrade some of these to urp okay so
01:00 - here i've imported them into my project
01:02 - i'm using unity twin 20.3 lts and the
01:05 - universal render pipeline now starting
01:07 - off with the action rpg effects pack as
01:09 - usual this pack starts off working with
01:11 - the built-in router pipeline by default
01:13 - but inside if you expand the folders you
01:15 - see an upgrades folder and inside you've
01:17 - got an unity package so just
01:19 - double-click and import this and it will
01:20 - be working in urp which is what i'm
01:22 - using here then you can just load up the
01:24 - demo scenes they've got tons of them so
01:26 - just load up demo one and as soon as you
01:28 - hit play you can already see a bunch of
01:29 - them working so here's a real nice chest
01:32 - a really nice move a bunch of auras
01:34 - bunch of icons a bunch of things all of
01:36 - them look really nice then down here you
01:38 - also got a bunch of buttons for swapping
01:40 - between each scene
01:41 - now this works by loading a scene so if
01:43 - you click on them you might see this
01:45 - error if so just go up here into file
01:47 - build settings and then just select all
01:50 - of your scenes
01:51 - and just click and drag them onto the
01:52 - build list so just for that you hit on
01:54 - play and now you can easily click on
01:56 - these buttons and load every single
01:58 - scene individual so with this you can
02:00 - see tons of stuff over here some really
02:02 - nice portals
02:03 - then you've got some really nice god
02:05 - rays a bunch of smoke and things there's
02:07 - a nice explosion then a bunch more
02:10 - things all of them looking quite
02:11 - mystical so perfect for any rpg
02:13 - then you've got some fire as well some
02:15 - rain a bunch more effects applied to a
02:17 - bunch of orbs as you can see tons of
02:18 - color variations then tons of circles
02:21 - lots of colors
02:22 - and a bunch more fires looking really
02:24 - nice a bunch of icons nice and shiny
02:26 - even some effects applied to some
02:28 - liquids
02:29 - and a bunch more nice explosions nice
02:31 - gathering power and so on so this one is
02:33 - really nice i'm a big fan of this type
02:35 - of style
02:36 - then the next pack is the aoe magic
02:38 - spells pack
02:40 - now for this one if you're using urp
02:42 - there's actually a text file so open up
02:44 - the demo folder and inside you see agrp
02:47 - and urp so it's a nice text file and
02:49 - over there you see a link where you can
02:51 - get the upgrade asset it's this one so
02:53 - just go ahead edit your assets and open
02:55 - it up in unity then you get this render
02:57 - pipeline support and all of these assets
02:59 - and just go ahead and unpack the one for
03:01 - the version you're using so over here
03:02 - i'm using unity 2020 and then once you
03:05 - unpack that just go up here into tools
03:07 - and open up the rp changer for the
03:09 - studio assets and just go ahead and
03:11 - click on the universal rp with that done
03:13 - you can now simply unload up the demo
03:15 - scene and now everything should look
03:16 - correct so you should be able to see all
03:18 - the effects but there's still one thing
03:20 - missing some post-processing now this
03:22 - one does include a post-processing
03:23 - profile but it's for the older
03:25 - post-processing v2 which is meant to be
03:27 - used with the built-in render pipeline
03:29 - if you're using urp then it's using a
03:30 - different system so for that you just
03:32 - create an object and you add the volume
03:34 - component then you create the new post
03:36 - crossing profile and then you can just
03:38 - copy the effects from the included post
03:40 - crossing profile so just add a bunch of
03:41 - bloom color grading and so on so it's
03:43 - what i have here so i added a bit of
03:44 - volume a bit of color adjustment some
03:46 - contrast saturation and so on
03:48 - and with that yep all of these gorgeous
03:50 - effects are now fully working in urp and
03:53 - some of them also have sound which make
03:55 - them pre-complete so they look really
03:57 - nice and they sound really good as well
03:59 - all of them got multiple color
04:00 - variations so you can easily change it
04:02 - so instead of a nice blue there you go
04:04 - nice green making it maybe a nice red
04:06 - there you go so all these are very
04:07 - adaptable and you've got all kinds of
04:09 - things so a bunch of things falling from
04:11 - the sky a bunch of really nice some
04:13 - explosions some more meteors falling
04:16 - a bunch of things falling from the sky
04:18 - a really nice particle explosion and so
04:21 - on all right so as you can see all of
04:23 - them look pretty nice so it's a great
04:24 - powder compact and finally for the
04:27 - realistic effects pack now this one has
04:29 - some gorgeous looking effects lots of
04:31 - them with some distortion which makes
04:32 - them look pretty great however one big
04:35 - downside is that these are made using
04:37 - the built-in runner pipeline and since
04:39 - most of these are custom shaders custom
04:41 - made shaders they don't automatically
04:42 - convert into urp so sadly that means
04:45 - that if you're making a game using urp
04:47 - then you can't easily use these ones now
04:49 - if you're a shader programmer yourself
04:51 - you might be able to convert the shaders
04:52 - directly all the files are included here
04:55 - so you can manually go and try to
04:56 - convert them
04:58 - now for me i'm not a shader program
04:59 - myself so i'm not sure just how
05:01 - difficult that is or maybe you can just
05:03 - open them in a project using the
05:05 - built-in writer pipeline which is what
05:06 - i'm using here
05:07 - and then simply have another project
05:09 - with urp and try and look at visually
05:11 - and convert them
05:12 - basically the only thing that does not
05:13 - work between the render pipelines is
05:15 - just a renderer so just the specific
05:17 - shaders that they're using so this
05:18 - specific shader does not automatically
05:20 - convert to urp but the particle system
05:22 - itself does work all the textures and so
05:24 - on all of those work so you really just
05:26 - need to convert the actual shader itself
05:28 - so anyways if you can convert it
05:30 - yourself or if you're making a game
05:31 - using the built-in runner pipeline then
05:33 - the effects themselves are pretty great
05:35 - this distortion effect especially looks
05:37 - really nice so you can see you've got
05:38 - all kinds of things a bunch of things
05:40 - coming out of the character then for
05:42 - this one a really nice healing effect
05:43 - and over here really nice laser then a
05:46 - character running and dropping some fire
05:48 - as he runs some more lasers a really
05:50 - nice explosion a really nice jet pack so
05:52 - as you can see tons of really nice
05:54 - really awesome so the ones on this pack
05:56 - look really nice just keep in mind that
05:58 - limitation all right so those are the
06:00 - three packs that you can get but then
06:01 - the sale also has tons more of them on
06:04 - sale of them at 50 off

06:10 - whatever you're looking for now most of
06:12 - them are particle effects but there's
