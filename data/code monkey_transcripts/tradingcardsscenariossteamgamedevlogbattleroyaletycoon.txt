00:00 - in this video I'm going to go over the
00:02 - progress on my Steam game along with an
00:03 - overview of how each ailment works
00:05 - trading cards scenarios performance
00:07 - improvements and more by the way next
00:10 - month there's going to be unite
00:11 - Copenhagen which is a unity conference
00:12 - with lots of interesting talks about all
00:15 - kinds of unity features as well as
00:16 - looking into what's coming in the future
00:17 - I've been invited by unity to attend and
00:20 - if you're planning on going you can use
00:21 - this coupon code to get 20% off the
00:23 - ticket price all right
00:25 - what
00:28 - [Music]
00:33 - so a lot of great progress these past
00:36 - few weeks the game is really coming
00:37 - along nicely there's still a lot to be
00:39 - done but I've gotten to the point where
00:41 - sometimes I go in for a quick test and
00:43 - end up playing for 20 minutes so that's
00:44 - usually a good sign all the various
00:47 - systems are starting to come together
00:48 - into a cohesive experience with nice
00:50 - progress if you want you can pick up the
00:53 - game right now on early access or just
00:55 - add it to your wish list and you'll be
00:56 - notified for the phone release on
00:58 - September 2nd and if you do get the game
01:00 - please make sure to write a review since
01:02 - those Humpty game get more visibility as
01:03 - well as providing valve on feedback all
01:06 - right then let's all get some elements
01:07 - I've been working on here's the first of
01:10 - these team features and one of the most
01:12 - important ones the trading cards trading
01:14 - cards are always stressful for me to
01:16 - make since I'm not an artist but I think
01:18 - I managed to make some great ones the
01:20 - cards are based on each of the game
01:21 - modes in the game and I think them look
01:23 - quite nice so there are six trading
01:25 - cards to collect with the usual five
01:26 - badges post-oil 10 emoticons and three
01:29 - profound backgrounds that's the first of
01:31 - the same features done now next week I
01:33 - still have to work on adding
01:34 - achievements cloud workshop and others
01:36 - so a lot of work is not to be done in
01:39 - terms of progress on the game itself I
01:41 - finally managed to get almost everything
01:43 - set up for multiple different scenarios
01:45 - each of them has a slightly different
01:47 - visual and build area along with
01:49 - different guest preferences research and
01:51 - so on the scenarios are how the game
01:53 - handles progression so on the first
01:55 - scenario the player won't go through the
01:57 - tutorial and deal with some very simple
01:59 - guests essentially they will enjoy
02:00 - pretty much every building then on the
02:03 - next scenario the guests become more
02:04 - picky about exactly what they like so
02:06 - what specific arena type with a specific
02:09 - layout size and so on so there are a lot
02:11 - of elements that make each scenario
02:13 - unique with increasing difficulty also
02:15 - one new addition is the visual expansion
02:18 - of the build area now until right now
02:20 - the map never changed so originally it
02:22 - was tough to actually see where you
02:24 - could build but right now the visuals on
02:26 - the outside perfectly matched the valid
02:28 - building area so here I can easily see
02:32 - how far I can build and then I can do
02:34 - some research research the expanding
02:37 - build area and when I do there you go it
02:39 - expanded and here on the second scenario
02:42 - it expands
02:43 - what time so now there it is the visual
02:45 - matches the actual built area
02:47 - now I spend the end and II visual
02:49 - expands and I spend the third time and
02:51 - the vision will expend some more it's
02:53 - now it's very easy to see where I can
02:55 - build how the scenarios are completed is
02:57 - through the objectives so over here the
03:00 - scenario objectives now each scenario
03:02 - has a set of objectives like you must
03:04 - reach a certain park rating or have a
03:06 - certain amount of guests in the park and
03:08 - so on when the player completes all the
03:10 - objectives then he can move on to the
03:11 - next scenario so it's at a nice goal
03:14 - that differs per each different scenario
03:16 - now one of the things that I still want
03:18 - to implement is some sort of degree of
03:20 - completion so if you complete the basic
03:22 - objectives you can move to the next
03:24 - scenario if you want or you can also
03:26 - stick around in the same scenario
03:27 - continue playing your current game and
03:29 - try to achieve bonus objectives that
03:31 - would give the player more flexibility
03:33 - for how they want to fight one very
03:35 - important change I've made in the last
03:37 - update was modifying the amount of time
03:39 - to be longer so here the clock goes up
03:41 - much slower even on super fast speed the
03:44 - reason for this decision was due to how
03:46 - so many of the sets from the game are
03:48 - sorted in terms of month so for example
03:51 - here on the overlays for the revenue it
03:53 - shows the total and then for each
03:55 - particular month the more complex
03:58 - buildings actually take quite a while to
03:59 - complete the entire behavior so in here
04:02 - it takes quite a while for them to all
04:03 - set up on the ESCO in all they fight and
04:06 - so on so previously they were going just
04:08 - once per month the result of that is
04:11 - that the per month data was very
04:12 - inconsistent so the longer month allows
04:15 - for each monthly value to be more smooth
04:17 - which helps understand if things are
04:19 - going well or badly now if you're
04:21 - interested in how the code works here it
04:23 - is here is the clock class as you can
04:27 - see it's pretty simple it is based on
04:29 - the time.take system in order to keep
04:31 - track of time I've covered this system
04:33 - in another video so check that out how
04:34 - it works and how it can be useful so the
04:37 - time.take system won't take on every
04:39 - time tick and here I just have a bunch
04:41 - of functions to convert a specific time
04:43 - tick into various days months and years
04:46 - so in here in order to make the month
04:48 - longer only did was modify this concept
04:51 - so it used to be a thousand takes per
04:53 - month and now it
04:54 - 1,700 takes per month so that's all I
04:56 - need to change in order to make each
04:58 - month longer and then the static event
05:00 - works the same as always so everything
05:02 - else works falsi related to the new
05:05 - month is the new month stats window so
05:08 - let's wait for the amount to complete
05:09 - and after October is done and here we go
05:13 - and yep there it is our new nice month
05:16 - stats window so this shows some basic
05:19 - stats related to the previous month so
05:20 - you can easily see the changes to see if
05:22 - you're doing better or worse so here for
05:25 - example 16% improvement on the revenue
05:27 - 11% down on the guests entertained and
05:30 - won increased on the park rating it also
05:32 - shows the most positive and most
05:34 - negative thought so you can easily
05:36 - identify what your guests are
05:38 - complaining about so you can fix and
05:39 - improve and over here the assistant tip
05:42 - which is something that I really want to
05:43 - add in Tekken games one of the game
05:46 - design problems is that it's always
05:47 - difficult to teach the player absolutely
05:49 - everything since there are so many
05:51 - systems at work in order for the
05:53 - tutorial to be short and brief I have to
05:55 - focus on only teaching the absolute
05:56 - essentials so this nice little tip every
05:59 - month really helps the player to give
06:00 - more tips on how to improve and explain
06:02 - how each system works there is also a
06:05 - new guests window it shows a bunch of
06:08 - stats for guests like how many are in
06:10 - the park how many I visited total the
06:12 - average happiness and so on so that's
06:14 - nice but more importantly is here on the
06:16 - right these are the guest preferences
06:18 - for the guests on this particular
06:19 - scenario so every guest that gets spawn
06:22 - has these particular preferences so for
06:24 - example there won't be no guest spawned
06:26 - where their favorite building is eat
06:27 - don't show them so using this
06:29 - information you can decide how best to
06:31 - build your Park so in this case make an
06:34 - arena of any type other than team
06:36 - deathmatch and make sure that it's a
06:37 - size small now the guests still go to
06:40 - all arenas and buildings but they
06:42 - prioritize the ones that best match up
06:43 - with their preferences and if all the
06:45 - preferences match they love the arena
06:47 - and are willing to pay more
06:48 - another new window is over here the new
06:51 - research window this one is much better
06:53 - much more clear compared to the old
06:55 - version so the buttons are bigger the
06:58 - icon
06:59 - are more easily seen and you can easily
07:01 - see which ones have already been
07:03 - unlocking which ones need to be unlocked
07:05 - the tooltips also help clarify the
07:08 - reason why for example all this research
07:10 - is locked which is not available in this
07:12 - scenario so this one is already locked
07:14 - this one can be a lot and these are not
07:16 - available so you can see that the
07:18 - research progression is tied to the
07:20 - scenario progression now down here you
07:22 - can see the new addition the advertising
07:24 - system I'm still working on it
07:26 - but the goal is to provide a use for the
07:27 - laboratory when all the research of a
07:29 - particular scenario has been done so
07:31 - after you research all of the available
07:33 - research you can get your work is busy
07:35 - doing advertising the result is an
07:38 - increase in the number of guests
07:39 - obviously each of them becomes more
07:41 - expensive and it has a higher effect
07:43 - here is the advertising class as you can
07:46 - see the various types Flyers newspaper
07:48 - and TV the cost for each of them how
07:51 - many workers are needed in order to
07:53 - start doing that advertising it's for
07:55 - example in order to do adverts on TV you
07:57 - need to have six workers working on the
07:59 - in laboratory and over here is the guest
08:02 - bonus per each type the guest bonus is
08:05 - used over here on the guest spawn or
08:07 - class as you can see each scenario has a
08:10 - maximum guest spawn amount and how many
08:12 - guests are spawned is dependent on the
08:14 - park rating multiplied by that maximum
08:16 - so over here on level one if you have a
08:19 - park with a hundred rating then you
08:22 - won't have 300 guests going into your
08:24 - park on a level three 100 rating won't
08:26 - equal five on a guest so that's the base
08:29 - for the maximum guest spot amount and
08:31 - then you add the advertising guest bonus
08:33 - which again also multiplied by the park
08:35 - grade so here on the es bonus you can
08:38 - see the TV has a bonus of 200 so in
08:42 - theory if you were on level three with a
08:44 - perfect park rating and TV advertising
08:46 - working you would get five hundred plus
08:48 - 200 so seven hundred maximum guests on
08:50 - your part so this is a great new feature
08:52 - new tool to keep things engaging in the
08:55 - awake game now once again I have
08:57 - improved ground performance so
08:59 - previously the game would hang whenever
09:01 - you place the ground so as I place here
09:03 - the game with essentially hanging for
09:05 - 500 milliseconds and right now as you
09:07 - can see there's pretty much no hang
09:08 - whatsoever because the
09:10 - thing is being done in just 20
09:11 - milliseconds so that's a massive
09:13 - improvement the way I achieve this
09:15 - performance boost was due to how the
09:17 - ground tiles are displayed over here in
09:19 - the editor you can see that the gram
09:21 - tile is a dynamic mesh filled up with
09:24 - dozens of quads so with the wireframe
09:28 - enabled you can see each of them is a
09:29 - different quad so previously the issue
09:32 - with the system was I was adding each
09:34 - one to the mesh and updating it one by
09:36 - one so essentially it would add this
09:38 - quad update mesh at this one update at
09:40 - this one update and so on and so on now
09:42 - as you might know it's very slow to
09:44 - actually update the mash and send the
09:45 - data to the GPU so what I did is first
09:48 - just work with simple arrays and fill
09:50 - them up with the necessary data so over
09:52 - here on the upgrade ground visuals
09:54 - function I first set up my mesh race so
09:57 - the vertices U visa and triangles then I
10:00 - cycle through all the ground objects and
10:02 - here previously I was adding it to the
10:05 - mesh for every single one whereas right
10:07 - now I'm simply adding it to the mesh
10:09 - erect so on this cycle goes through
10:12 - every single ground mesh and fills out
10:13 - these arrays and then at the end when
10:16 - all of them have been filled up with the
10:18 - correct data I finally update the mesh
10:20 - on the GB so the end result is a pre
10:23 - massive performance improvement and the
10:25 - game should no longer hang when adding
10:27 - more ground towns as you can see
10:29 - everything is smooth and works great one
10:31 - small thing I've added is that the
10:33 - arena's now support all sizes so
10:35 - previously my idea was to limit the
10:37 - sizes so for example a duel arena could
10:40 - not be large and a pattern where all
10:42 - arena could not be small this was an
10:44 - interesting idea but just end up with
10:46 - adding unnecessary confusion so with the
10:48 - addition of the yes preferences it was
10:50 - better just let all arenas have all
10:52 - sizes so this is another example of
10:55 - those tiny game design problems that can
10:57 - only be solved through iteration in the
10:59 - previous video I covered how I made the
11:01 - transporters carrying multiple weapons
11:03 - which really helps keep the game going
11:04 - and reduces overall weight time now
11:07 - another great improvement I've added was
11:09 - merging of various arena states so
11:11 - previously the arena's would wait to
11:13 - fully complete each state so the guests
11:15 - would go in they start fighting they
11:17 - finish the battle then they would go to
11:19 - leave when some of them left they
11:21 - the workers would finally go in and
11:23 - start doing the cleanup and once the
11:24 - cleanup was done then they would the set
11:26 - up and everything starts over now the
11:28 - change is that all of those three tasks
11:30 - now happened at the same time so as soon
11:33 - as the arena is done so there it is the
11:36 - bump is going to be the fuse and as you
11:38 - can see now they won't all start to
11:40 - leave at the same time as they are
11:41 - leaving the workers are cleaning up the
11:43 - arena and at the same time as they are
11:45 - cleaning up they are also setting up
11:46 - grabbing the new items and placing them
11:48 - on the same position so all of those
11:51 - tasks are now happening at once which
11:53 - makes everything go much smoother with
11:55 - much less waiting time so that coupled
11:58 - with the longer month really helps to
12:00 - keep all of the stats more smooth over
12:02 - time so that's what I've been working on
12:04 - lightly some of these features are
12:06 - already live on the current version and
12:08 - others I'm so working on oh no I'm quite
12:10 - pleased with how the game is turning out
12:12 - it's looking quite nice and everything
12:14 - works great so I'm really looking
12:15 - forward to having the final release if
12:17 - you want you can pick up the game right
12:19 - now on early access or just add it to
12:21 - your wish list and you'll be notified
12:22 - for the full release on September 2nd
12:24 - and if you do get the game please make
12:27 - sure you write a review since those help
12:28 - the game get more visibility as well as
12:30 - providing some valuable feedback if you
12:33 - like the video subscribe to the channel
12:34 - for more tutorials and dev ones post any
12:37 - questions you have in the comments and
12:38 - I'll do my best answer them
12:39 - alright see you next time
