01:24 - for exactly that just with this you can
01:26 - build an infinite amount of unique
01:27 - characters they also have some packs in
01:30 - a different style their simple series
01:32 - it's the sound that they started out
01:33 - with it's much more low poly more cube
01:35 - shapes
01:36 - so it's a pretty nice style and they're
01:38 - all also discount if you're making a
01:40 - racing game you have the street racer
01:42 - pack racing isn't the genre that i have

01:47 - want to build something features tons of
01:49 - cars tracks lots of pieces and props
01:51 - it's really nice
01:52 - for something more standard you have the
01:54 - military pack so this would be perfect
01:56 - if you're making a game inspired by call
01:58 - of duty or battlefield
01:59 - for something smaller you have the
02:01 - battleground pack which i've also used
02:03 - many times before it's what i use in my
02:05 - third person shooter video so this one
02:07 - is another great pack and it's also
02:09 - pretty cheap if you're making some kind
