00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made with unity for january 2021
00:06 - my goal with these videos is to
00:08 - highlight what can be done with the
00:09 - engine so you know that the only limit
00:11 - is really just your own imagination
00:13 - all of these games are uniquely
00:14 - impressive and showcase the power of the
00:15 - engine in tons of different scenarios so
00:17 - the list is in no particular order
00:19 - except for the number one game that is
00:20 - my personal pick of the month
00:22 - so let's go starting off at number 10.
00:24 - over here we have cobra kai the karate
00:27 - kid saga continues
00:28 - it's a fighting game with lots of
00:30 - abilities move sets and unique
00:31 - characters
00:32 - naturally it's based on the karate kid
00:34 - movies as well as the show so it's bound
00:36 - to be full of references
00:37 - teaches aside and play as one of eight
00:39 - unique characters fight your way through
00:41 - an epic beat em up adventure inspired by
00:43 - the show it's got lots of interesting
00:45 - unique skills
00:46 - they really took the concept of the
00:47 - movies and turned it into an epic
00:49 - brawler
00:50 - features a unique storyline for each
00:51 - sign so you fight as danielle from the
00:53 - miyagi school or as johnny from the

01:01 - the show like ralph macchio william

01:08 - in the genre
01:10 - kind then here we have a rare in the
01:12 - sequel mad games tycoon 2.
01:14 - this is a sequel to the first game that
01:16 - came out all the way back in 2016.
01:19 - that game was extremely successful and
01:20 - this one is already off to an excellent
01:22 - start
01:23 - as the name implies you run a game
01:25 - development company and play through the
01:27 - various
01:27 - eras start all the way back in 1976

01:41 - bring it to market the game is in phone
01:43 - 3d and looks pretty great
01:44 - the scale is also big you don't just
01:46 - manage a single building but rather

06:40 - [Music]
06:42 - next up for an interesting dungeon
06:44 - puzzle game here is one named
06:45 - exactly dungeon and puzzles you have a
06:48 - limited number of moves and abilities
06:49 - that you must use to destroy your
06:50 - enemies and leave the dungeon

07:05 - the optimal solution for all of them and
07:07 - clear the dungeon
07:10 - and finally here at number one is my
07:12 - personal pick for this month
07:14 - it is an awesome sci-fi simulation
07:16 - automation management game named dyson
07:18 - sphere program
07:19 - the dyson sphere is one of the coolest
07:21 - sci-fi concepts that i've heard of so
07:22 - i'm honestly surprised as to why this is
07:24 - the very first game that i've seen
07:25 - attack on that concept
07:26 - you control a main character a nice
07:28 - giant mech and start by directly
07:30 - gathering resources from your very first
07:32 - planet
07:33 - soon enough you stop doing manual labor
07:35 - and begin making some machines to do the
07:36 - work for you
07:37 - and then some conveyor belts to move the
07:39 - resource around
07:40 - you keep building and growing harvesting
07:42 - more and more energy and resources until
07:44 - you have enough to upgrade your mecha to
07:46 - interplanet travel
07:47 - colonize multiple planets and establish
07:49 - straight routes between them
07:50 - then continue growing upgrading to
07:52 - interstellar travel and create a dyson
07:54 - sphere to harvest the sun
07:56 - the universe is procedurally generated
07:57 - so every player has a totally unique
07:59 - experience
08:00 - it has all kinds of celestion bodies
08:02 - like neutron stars red giants white
08:04 - dwarfs and it even has some mysterious
08:06 - black holes so who knows what they do
08:09 - start smalling build the giant universe
08:10 - empire bit by bit
08:12 - the scale of the game is very impressive
08:14 - it makes me wonder if you're using dots
08:16 - or the job system anywhere in this game
08:18 - it really does have a massive very
08:20 - impressive scale with thousands of
08:21 - objects moving around
08:22 - and despite that this is being made by a
08:24 - small team of just five people so very
08:26 - very impressive
08:28 - they had a successful kickstarter that
08:29 - raised ten thousand dollars and is
08:31 - currently out in early access
08:33 - it's already got over five thousand
08:35 - overwhelmingly positive reviews so this
08:37 - is already a huge hit
08:39 - this is exactly my kind of game and i
08:40 - already picked it up for myself a while
08:42 - ago so look forward to a game dev review
08:44 - in the near future
08:48 - alright so there you have it 10 awesome
08:50 - new games made with unity

09:00 - i'm planning to do these videos about
09:02 - once a month so i can keep up to date
09:04 - with what's coming out
09:05 - if you want to be a successful indie
09:07 - game developer you definitely need to
09:08 - keep an eye on the current state of your
09:10 - competition
09:11 - and as i said another goal with this
09:12 - series is to highlight what can be done
09:14 - with the engine so you know that the
09:15 - only
09:16 - limit is really just your own
09:17 - imagination many of these games look
