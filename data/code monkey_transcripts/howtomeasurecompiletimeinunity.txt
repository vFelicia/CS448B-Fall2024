00:02 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:05 - and this is a quick tip for measuring
00:06 - compound time in the editor this can be
00:09 - useful if you're trying to organize your
00:10 - code into different assemblies and
00:12 - seeing if you're improving the compound
00:14 - time so let's start and create a new C
00:19 - sharp script and name it editor compile
00:22 - time okay so in here we're going to be
00:26 - using unity editor and we're going to
00:31 - apply the attribute execute in edit mode
00:35 - so that this class executes whilst we're
00:39 - in edit mode now on our private void
00:42 - update we're going to use editor
00:46 - application dot is compiling to measure
00:49 - our compile time north to do that we
00:52 - need some variables to store the current
00:54 - time so let's add a private double
00:57 - called compile start time and we also
01:01 - need to test if we are already compiling
01:03 - so a private ball is compiling and let's
01:07 - default that to false okay so on update
01:11 - we're going to test if is compile if we
01:16 - are already compiling we are going to
01:18 - test if the editor is no longer
01:21 - confounded and we're going to trigger a
01:23 - function called compile finish now if we
01:28 - are not compiling and all of a sudden
01:30 - editor application shows that we are
01:33 - compiling we have starts of a bomb start
01:37 - and modify our boolean so is compiling
01:41 - here suddenly became false and here it
01:44 - became true so let's make our functions
01:48 - a private boy compile started and the
01:53 - private boy compile pinch
01:58 - so on compulsory let's do a debug log
02:02 - and say compiled and started and we're
02:07 - going to store the compile starts time
02:10 - based on the editor application dot time
02:15 - since start up and then our compiled
02:19 - finished we are simply going to come in
02:22 - late the time that has passed since
02:23 - compiled start time so double compiled
02:27 - time equals editor application not time
02:31 - since startup - our compiled start time
02:34 - so this one returned the number of
02:36 - seconds that we have taken to compile so
02:40 - let's put a debug log and call it
02:43 - compile finish and this way compile time
02:48 - and we're going to do that to string f2
02:52 - so that we display two values so I don't
02:55 - say like 9.50 two and one second since
02:59 - this is measured in seconds okay so in
03:03 - here let's create an empty game object
03:05 - call it editor compile timer so that we
03:09 - can apply our script into it now our
03:11 - script is going to trigger on the update
03:13 - which won't be called when we modify
03:15 - something so let's modify the code of
03:17 - course compile there you go compile
03:19 - starting it's compiling compound
03:21 - finished so this is a very small project
03:24 - 2.29 seconds and as you can see anytime
03:27 - you make some changes you can test and
03:31 - see the resulting time okay so you can
03:34 - see how this would help you if you were
03:36 - going to go into create and create a
03:38 - bunch of assembly definitions this way
03:40 - you can easily measure if what you're
03:43 - doing is having a positive effect or not
03:47 - if you have any questions post them in
03:49 - the comments and I'll do my best to
03:50 - answer them alright
03:52 - see you next time
04:04 - you
