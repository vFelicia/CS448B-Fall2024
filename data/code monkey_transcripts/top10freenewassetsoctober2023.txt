00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - the asset swore is full of awesome tools
00:03 - and assets to help you make your own
00:04 - games there's more and more awesome
00:06 - stuff coming out every month so in this
00:07 - video let's check out some highlights
00:08 - for October 23 in this first video I'll
00:10 - be covering a list of free assets and
00:12 - next ones I'll be covering PID ass and
00:13 - tools let me know in the comments if you
00:15 - pick up any of these and what you intend
00:16 - to do with them and by the way my own
00:18 - game has just come out this month it's a
00:20 - fun game with some automation Colony
00:22 - building and defense mechanics where you
00:24 - build a colony automate it and keep the
00:25 - tiny defenseless dinky safe from harm
00:28 - you then colonize other planets ga
00:30 - Resources with the ultimate goal of
00:31 - colonizing every planet and automating
00:33 - everything so your dinkies can finally
00:35 - relax it is out now on seam I hope you
00:37 - like it and please make sure to write a
00:38 - review with your thoughts all right so
00:40 - on to the top 10 list starting off with
00:41 - a really nice looking tool for making 2D
00:44 - soft bodies this can be some slightly
00:46 - stretchy objects or it can be some
00:47 - fluids and it seems it's able to do it
00:49 - in a very performant manner with lots of
00:51 - particles interacting I covered how to
00:53 - do some basic fluid simulation in a
00:55 - tutorial quite a long time ago the issue
00:57 - with that method was only performance
00:59 - I'm surprised that at how good this one
01:00 - seems to be especially considering how
01:02 - it's free I tried looking to see if it
01:04 - was just a free trial version but nope
01:06 - it seems to be entirely free so if you
01:07 - have an idea for a game that is based on
01:09 - fluids or sof body physics then this
01:11 - would be a great starting point it also
01:13 - has all the code available on GitHub so
01:15 - that also makes this an excellent
01:16 - research project next for some visual
01:19 - assets here is a free military pack it
01:21 - features a bunch of parts for making a
01:23 - military base so you've got some tin
01:25 - some sandbags a tower a bunch of crates
01:28 - targets and even a tank so this would be
01:30 - a great staring pack and if you like
01:32 - this style then this tab has tons more
01:34 - then if you need a tun Shader here's a
01:36 - really nice free one it's made by cro
01:38 - who used to work at unity and was
01:40 - involved in that really nice Unity open
01:42 - project game with that really nice
01:43 - looking pick character that game was
01:45 - using a tune Shader so I wonder if this
01:47 - is him taking that and making it a fully
01:49 - complete nice free accet the video shows
01:51 - the Shader being applied to jemo which
01:53 - is the fun official character from the
01:55 - excellent Channel mixing Jam adding a
01:56 - custom Shader like this one is a great
01:58 - way to improve how your game looks
01:59 - personally I always love tun shaders
02:02 - next here is an interesting complex tool
02:03 - called super Behavior this one is
02:06 - basically a class that replaces the
02:07 - standard mono Behavior it automatically
02:10 - caches the transforms it adds inspector
02:12 - property support and already has some
02:13 - pre-written patterns like Singletons you
02:16 - can easily Define icons for your custom
02:17 - scripts then those icons show up in the
02:19 - inspector and in the project files it
02:21 - even has some interesting vs code
02:23 - extension with some nice time-saving
02:25 - Snippets then if you need some status
02:27 - icons here's a bunch of fantasy ones
02:29 - it's a a super simple pack with some
02:31 - eight nice unique icons you could easily
02:33 - animate them to get quite a bit of
02:35 - variation you could make them shake or
02:36 - change the alpha so this would fit
02:38 - perfectly in any cartoony game like for
02:40 - example I could even use some of these
02:41 - in my own game dinky Gard next if you're
02:44 - working on a game where you need some
02:45 - regular humans check out this pack it
02:47 - features eight characters all of them
02:49 - fully rigged it's a really nice low poly
02:51 - flat shaded style the textures are
02:53 - interchangeable and since they are all
02:55 - flat shaded you could also easily
02:57 - recolor them so with just this one pack
02:59 - you could definitely get tons of
03:00 - variation I can see this one being great
03:02 - for making a game kind of like inspired
03:04 - by The Sims and if you like this free
03:05 - asset you can get the full pack with
03:07 - tons more characters next for a simple
03:09 - visual tool here we have some hierarchy
03:11 - icons this is pretty simple it does
03:13 - exactly what you expect it can be quite
03:16 - useful if you have tons of systems in
03:17 - your hierarchy and you want to very
03:19 - quickly find a medic lens it use the
03:21 - default Unity icon so you don't even
03:23 - need to draw anything although I also
03:25 - assume you could modify to support any
03:26 - icon Sprite to make all of your scripts
03:28 - look nice and unique then if you're
03:30 - working on a casual game here's a nice
03:32 - and simple UI pack you've got pretty
03:34 - much all of the basic elements that you
03:35 - could possibly need to make a casual
03:37 - game you've got some frames some
03:39 - backgrounds various generic buttons and
03:41 - bars so if you like me have no art
03:43 - skills then a super basic pack like this
03:45 - one will greatly help your game look
03:46 - much better even during just e prototype
03:48 - stage next if you need some cute
03:50 - characters check out this one it's a
03:52 - pretty nice skeleton in a cute style
03:54 - it's very round it's got a very big head
03:57 - it also has a humanoid rig and also even
03:59 - a BL shape on the face to go from Angry
04:01 - to sad if you like this style then this
04:03 - tab has tons more then for another
04:05 - really interesting tool here is the
04:06 - debug inspector this one is a nice and
04:09 - simple tool for locating all of your
04:10 - debug logs in all of your files this can
04:13 - definitely be quite useful when you have
04:15 - quite a large project with logs all over
04:17 - the place this makes it super easy to
04:19 - find them even if they are commented out
04:20 - you can then either modify them or
04:22 - remove them directly from the window or
04:24 - simply open up the script it's quite an
04:26 - interesting very unique tool all right
04:28 - so those are my top 10 free new assets
04:30 - on the UN assur for October 23 there's
04:32 - links to all in the description also
