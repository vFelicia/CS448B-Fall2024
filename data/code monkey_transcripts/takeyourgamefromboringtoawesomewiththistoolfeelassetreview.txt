00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's check out one asset that
00:04 - will greatly increase your odds of
00:05 - success now you're probably already
00:07 - aware of the term game feel or game
00:09 - juice or just nice feedback meaning add
00:12 - tons of screen shake lots of flashy
00:13 - things punchy sound effects and much
00:15 - more there's a bunch of really awesome
00:17 - talks on youtube about this topic i've
00:19 - linked them in the description
00:20 - definitely watch those if you don't know
00:22 - about how to make your game feel awesome
00:24 - so what this s does is exactly that it's
00:26 - a collection of tools and effects to
00:28 - take your game from boring to awesome
00:30 - just by looking at some simple examples
00:32 - you can see the huge difference it makes
00:33 - between the basic boring game and the
00:35 - one with awesome feedback adding a bunch
00:37 - of excellent game feel into your game
00:39 - will massively increase your chance of
00:41 - success and this asset helps you do that
00:43 - so this video is pointed in two parts
00:45 - first let's look at some of the demos to
00:47 - see what the asset can do and how they
00:48 - work then after that i'll do a
00:50 - step-by-step guide on how to start using
00:52 - it and add it to your own games there's
00:54 - timestamps in the video if you want to
00:55 - look ahead check out the entire asset
00:57 - review playlist where i highlight great
00:58 - assets to help you make your games
01:00 - awesome also this video is sponsored by
01:02 - unity which is currently running the new
01:04 - year sale on the unity as a store this
01:06 - sale has tons of assets that have never
01:08 - been discounted previously so if there's
01:09 - something that came out recently then
01:11 - chances are it's discounted for the very
01:13 - first time on this sale there's over 8
01:15 - 000 assets heavily discounted everything
01:17 - from tools to models animations and tons
01:20 - of effects most of the assets i've
01:21 - covered in my asset review series are
01:23 - discounted i also made a video and a
01:25 - list covering some of the best
01:26 - highlights and on top of that this cell
01:29 - also has a special coupon if the total
01:31 - is above 150
01:32 - however i haven't even bought a coupon

01:56 - feel this asset really helps you in
01:59 - making your games feel awesome it is
02:01 - very well built everything is very easy
02:03 - to use you have tons of graphs to
02:05 - visually play with tons of options for
02:07 - how to interpolate your values lots of
02:09 - timing options and it's super simple to
02:11 - trigger the effects also i should
02:13 - mention that the effects part is really
02:14 - just one part of this asset this is
02:16 - actually three assets in one so you have
02:19 - the mm feedbacks which is the system to
02:21 - handle all of those effects then you
02:23 - also have nice vibrations this one is a
02:25 - tool for helping you add haptic feedback
02:28 - to your mobile games and finally mm
02:30 - tools this one is a collection of
02:32 - various helpful tools there's one to
02:34 - manage sound create sequences of actions
02:36 - make a simple state machine debug menu
02:39 - visually plot your tweens and more so
02:41 - this asset really is those three in one
02:43 - so here i've got my project and i import
02:45 - the asset now in terms of documentation
02:47 - the asset is great you can see there's a
02:49 - huge amount of separate demos all of
02:51 - them covering all kinds of use cases and
02:53 - the documentation on the website is also
02:55 - excellent the website is very clean with
02:58 - a nice summary of each demo and exactly
03:00 - what they showcase so for example here's
03:01 - a quick video tutorial on how to install
03:03 - a field either in video or a text
03:05 - tutorial
03:06 - then here's the demo page which
03:07 - showcases all of the various demos
03:09 - including the asset so this website
03:11 - really is really awesome another thing
03:13 - is over here you've got a page for
03:15 - recipes so these are some super quick
03:17 - tutorials that teach you how to
03:18 - implement some specific scenario for
03:20 - example how to set up a syn machine
03:22 - camera shake and there you go you've got
03:24 - some very simple instructions so just
03:26 - import feel important machine add the
03:28 - impulse listener extension create a mm
03:30 - feedback object assign a syn machine
03:32 - impulse feedback and so on so lots of
03:35 - mini tutorials on how to do all kinds of
03:37 - things then you've got a getting started
03:39 - a bunch of concepts a list of all the
03:41 - effects and so on so the website is
03:43 - really awesome and some excellent
03:44 - documentation so back in unity let's
03:46 - check out some of the demos also one
03:48 - important thing on the render pipelines
03:51 - now the asset works on all the render
03:52 - pipelines for most of it it really
03:54 - doesn't matter for example making the
03:56 - screen shake that's not really related
03:58 - to any render pipeline so the only time
04:00 - when it matters is when animating the
04:02 - post-processing effects each render
04:04 - pipeline has its own post-processing
04:06 - stacks so they require different
04:07 - components but in terms of usability
04:09 - it's really all the same as working with
04:11 - any other property so speaking of that
04:13 - let's start with the urp demo it's a
04:15 - really nice bowling demo so the ball is
04:18 - constantly looking left and right and as
04:19 - soon as i hit space
04:21 - yep there it goes the balls thrown
04:22 - forward hits the pins with all kinds of
04:24 - really nice effects and then a really
04:26 - nice reset there's also some really nice
04:28 - sound effects so as soon as i press
04:31 - and if there you go looks really nice
04:33 - really satisfying
04:36 - however if i pause the game and i'll
04:38 - look into the various feedback
04:40 - components so i go here and i'm just
04:42 - going to disable all these effects so i
04:45 - disable them all and now if we test and
04:47 - if there you go it looks much more
04:49 - boring and the reset also instant so all
04:52 - of it looking much more boring so
04:54 - compare that with the version with all
04:56 - of the effects added and yep look that
04:58 - really awesome so just with this you can
05:00 - see the huge difference that adding all
05:02 - these effects makes without them it
05:04 - really looks like an amateur game
05:05 - there's nothing flashy no hit feedback
05:08 - no sounds the ui is boring and reset
05:10 - happens instantly but with all the
05:12 - effects it looks like a proper polished
05:14 - professional game then here on the left
05:16 - side there's also a menu where you can
05:17 - click to see each effect in action now
05:20 - this one is the urp demo so this one
05:22 - shows specifically the things that are
05:23 - exclusive to urp which are really just
05:25 - the volume post pressing effects so for
05:27 - example you click on it and you see how
05:29 - it increases and decreases bloom so
05:30 - really nice then the channel mixer of it
05:33 - changing
05:34 - really nice and smooth so all of it
05:36 - interpolated instead of being massively
05:38 - insanely
05:39 - and of course you can also inspect how
05:41 - all this is working so on this demo you
05:43 - can go inside the canvas go inside the
05:46 - scroll rect and over here you've got all
05:48 - the various ones so for example on bloom
05:50 - you can see inside there's a mm
05:51 - feedbacks object
05:53 - and then here you can see it has the mm
05:55 - feedbacks component and it's got a bloom
05:57 - urp and then down here you see the curve
05:59 - how it starts from zero increases and
06:01 - decreases so you see how easy it works
06:03 - but we'll see the getting started guide
06:05 - in a bit now this is just one of the
06:07 - demos so let's see some other ones for
06:09 - example here is a very basic snake demo
06:12 - so it's really just a snake game just
06:14 - rotating around trying to grab all these
06:15 - balls all these food
06:17 - so it's really very simple it's really
06:19 - just a bunch of squares a bunch of
06:20 - spheres but with all these effects you
06:22 - can see how it looks really really nice
06:24 - and awesome look at that then over here
06:26 - the bounce demo now this one has a scene
06:28 - without feedbacks so i press on space
06:31 - and there you go the character jumps up
06:32 - and down really very boring
06:34 - and now enable all the effects and now
06:36 - with the jump look at that really
06:37 - awesome much more impactful then here is
06:40 - the card zy demo features lots of
06:42 - satisfying movements some bounces some
06:44 - post-processing visual effects all of
06:46 - them looking really nice really
06:47 - satisfying this one shows a progress bar
06:50 - so how you can make even just a basic ui
06:52 - make it much more polished much more
06:54 - impactful and this one the mm feedbacks
06:57 - demo this one shows tons of individual
06:59 - effects so as you can see this as it can
07:01 - modify pretty much everything so you can
07:03 - do some animations you can do some
07:06 - destruction enable or disable some
07:08 - behavior
07:09 - instantiate a bunch of objects change
07:11 - the camera feel of the view do a bunch
07:12 - of camera shake then again play around
07:14 - all the post pressing
07:16 - you can use it to animate textures in
07:18 - texture scale you can freeze frame do a
07:20 - time modifier so enable some slow motion
07:23 - move rotate a transform and so on so on
07:26 - there's even tons of them for floating
07:28 - ui text as well as a bunch with text
07:30 - mesh pro there's also some audio as well
07:32 - as even a really nice debug log so
07:35 - here's the console looking really nice
07:37 - and all this everything that you see
07:38 - here everything you can modify you can
07:40 - do it with all kinds of triggers and all
07:42 - kinds of curves to get it triggered
07:44 - exactly as you want it and behave
07:45 - exactly as you intend okay so now that
07:48 - we've seen the official documentation
07:49 - and demos let's go to the second part of
07:51 - this video and learn how to apply it to
07:53 - our game so here is my demo i've got my
07:56 - character and a zombie target so let's
07:58 - pretend this game is sort of like an
08:00 - xcom game so a turn-based tactical game
08:03 - so i'm controlling this character and on
08:04 - my next turn i decide to take the action
08:06 - of shooting the assembly so i do the
08:08 - action and there you go shoot the zombie
08:10 - and the zombie flies so it's a pretty
08:12 - simple demo so i just take my action and
08:15 - i shoot and there you go it falls out so
08:17 - right now it feels very boring so let's
08:19 - use this asset to spice things up
08:21 - essentially i prepared some things like
08:23 - some cameras and some particles and
08:24 - we're going to use feel to trigger all
08:26 - the actions and play around the values
08:28 - here is the script that i'm using on
08:29 - this demo
08:30 - so it's very simple really just on
08:32 - update checking for the spacebar input
08:34 - and if so then we spawn a bullet so
08:36 - we're only just instantiating the prefab
08:38 - and then for the zombie hit we're only
08:39 - just disabling the animator so the
08:41 - ragdoll falls down and adding some
08:43 - explosion solve it pretty simple and
08:46 - like this the demo is pretty boring you
08:47 - really just press a button and the
08:49 - zombies shot instantly so one of the
08:51 - first effects that i want to add is this
08:53 - particle system
08:54 - essentially i want to add some
08:55 - anticipation for this action so i want
08:57 - these particles to build up before the
08:59 - weapon actually fires so let's do that
09:02 - let's begin by making an empty game
09:03 - object let's name it just mm feedbacks
09:07 - and then here first of all reset
09:08 - transform and let's add a component then
09:11 - you can either search or go up here into
09:13 - more mountains then go into feedbacks
09:15 - and let's add the mmf feedbacks okay so
09:18 - now we've got a really nice button here
09:19 - to add any kind of feedback now the
09:21 - first one we want is to have the
09:23 - particles start playing so let's add a
09:25 - feedback let's go down here into
09:27 - particles and let's enable of type
09:29 - particles play just like it says on this
09:31 - note we'll simply play the specified
09:33 - particle system then here we've got the
09:35 - label so we can change the text that
09:36 - appears in there so we can make this a
09:38 - bit more specific so let's say shoot
09:40 - particles play then down here for the
09:42 - mode we want to set the particles to
09:43 - start playing when it reaches this
09:45 - feedback
09:46 - and then just assign the particle system
09:47 - so just drag the reference okay so
09:49 - that's it just like this it's already
09:51 - enough to trigger the particles so we
09:53 - can test this the game is currently
09:55 - playing and now for testing the
09:56 - component has some super useful testing
09:58 - buttons so these buttons down here apply
10:00 - to all feedback so they run through the
10:02 - entire feedback list or each individual
10:04 - feedback also has a player stop button
10:06 - so for example it sets out just as shoot
10:08 - particles hit on play and if there you
10:10 - go the particle system does indeed start
10:11 - playing okay great
10:13 - now this demo i also set up two virtual
10:16 - action cameras
10:17 - so one of them is right behind the
10:19 - player and then there's another one
10:20 - right in front of the zombie
10:22 - so let's say we want to use these along
10:24 - with our actions now there are two ways
10:26 - we can do that we can go into our mm
10:28 - feedbacks going to add a feedback and
10:30 - then here under a camera we can add a
10:32 - send machine transition so we could use
10:34 - this effect this one requires a bit of
10:36 - setup or we can just take the simpler
10:39 - approach and really just enable or
10:40 - disable these game objects so the action
10:42 - camera always has a higher priority so
10:44 - as soon as i enable it's going to switch
10:46 - this one disable and go back into normal
10:48 - okay so here let's add new feedback
10:50 - let's go into our game object and we're
10:53 - going to make it of type set active then
10:55 - let's drag this reference so the action
10:57 - camera one
10:58 - so activate action camera one
11:02 - and now these are the sets and on play
11:04 - is when we actually reach this feedback
11:07 - effect so when we play when we reach
11:09 - this one we want to enable down
11:11 - so let's go straight on play we're going
11:13 - to set it to active okay so let's test
11:15 - and see if this activates the second
11:16 - camera so the game is currently playing
11:18 - and press on this button and there you
11:20 - go it does activate that camera okay
11:22 - great now for the next effect let's add
11:25 - a growing screen shake while the player
11:26 - is charging up the shop so for screen
11:29 - shape let's add a new feedback and this
11:31 - time we're going to go into camera and
11:33 - we're going to add it of types in
11:34 - machine impulse and just like it says
11:36 - here on the note this lets you trigger a
11:39 - syn machine impulse event which also
11:41 - means you need a syn machine impulse
11:42 - listener on the camera so let's go into
11:45 - the virtual camera and down here there's
11:46 - a button to add an extension so here
11:49 - let's add a send machine impulse
11:50 - listener then for the setup we can leave
11:52 - it all in defaults just make sure to
11:53 - attach it to all the cameras that you're
11:55 - using so for me i'm going to add it to
11:56 - these two now back on the feedback let's
11:59 - set this up so for the impulse channel
12:00 - yeah we'll left everything on default
12:02 - okay that's good for the raw signal we
12:04 - can use one of the presets so let's use
12:06 - the 6d shake then you can play around
12:08 - the amplitude and frequency but the most
12:10 - important one is over here playing
12:11 - around with the attack
12:13 - so this is the start portion of the
12:14 - shake and we want to increase in
12:16 - intensity so this area right here this
12:18 - one is an animation curve so if you
12:20 - click on it yep it shows you a really
12:22 - nice animation curve so we want to
12:24 - slowly increase intensity so we can go
12:26 - either with the flat or maybe this one
12:28 - and for the time let's say we want to
12:30 - increase it over three seconds and
12:31 - that's all we need so let's put the
12:33 - sustain and decay both on zero
12:35 - and the last thing that we need is down
12:37 - here on the velocity
12:38 - so this is the intensity so essentially
12:40 - the strength of the screen shake let's
12:42 - not put it by too much so maybe just 0.5
12:44 - on all of them okay so let's set this
12:46 - feedback so the game is playing and as i
12:48 - hit on play and yep there you go there's
12:51 - a slight shake and slowly increasing so
12:53 - maybe we can increase the intensity by a
12:55 - little bit
12:57 - and yep it does start to shake a bit
12:58 - better okay great
13:00 - so far we have some particles then we
13:02 - activate the action camera then we start
13:03 - shaking now for the next one let's
13:06 - trigger an event to fire the actual
13:08 - bullet but we want to do that after the
13:10 - charge up is completed so for that let's
13:12 - add new feedback and for this one we're
13:13 - going to go into events
13:15 - and then over here you see a bunch of
13:17 - standard yint events so these are
13:19 - triggered at various stages so a play
13:21 - then that's when the feedback reaches
13:23 - this event there's a stop event in case
13:25 - you stop this one the initialization
13:27 - which happens in the beginning so there
13:28 - you go over here you've got the settings
13:30 - and then the reset when the whole thing
13:31 - resets so in this case we want to
13:33 - trigger something when we get to this
13:34 - particular feedback so let's do it on
13:36 - playing and really this one is a normal
13:38 - unit event so just click on pause then
13:40 - we drag the script so let's drag that
13:42 - one then go into the asset review field
13:44 - this is the script that i'm using
13:46 - in this case i want to call the spawnbot
13:48 - function okay so that's pretty much it
13:50 - but we don't want this event to be
13:52 - triggered right on start so on timing we
13:55 - have this nice section here there are
13:57 - tons of options and most important one
13:58 - is over here the initial delay in this
14:00 - case we want to shoot the bullet after
14:02 - three seconds so let's just put a three
14:04 - right here also note how here on the
14:06 - feedback list on the right side you can
14:08 - see how long until these events are
14:09 - activated that's in machine impulse is
14:12 - activated on zero less for three seconds
14:14 - so that's why it goes there
14:15 - and events that one has only three
14:16 - seconds and then it's instant
14:18 - okay so let's just like this okay the
14:20 - game is playing so let's test
14:22 - but let's test all the feedbacks instead
14:24 - of just one by one so over here i've got
14:27 - a second inspector open and i'm going to
14:29 - trigger the play button
14:30 - so let's just move it to the side press
14:32 - the button and there you go the camera
14:34 - goes in the particles start flying and
14:36 - after three seconds yep we've got the
14:37 - bullet all right great so you saw how
14:40 - the camera zoomed in it started shaking
14:42 - the particles start playing then it
14:44 - shakes some more when their weapon is
14:46 - charged and the shot is fired so with
14:48 - what we have here you can already see
14:50 - just how easy it is to set up all these
14:52 - actions and all this timing now let's
14:54 - make some more
14:55 - let's add a more intense shake when we
14:57 - shoot
14:58 - so let's do the same thing we did
14:59 - previously so also another scene machine
15:01 - impulse so let's add another one total
15:03 - difference is this one no attack time
15:05 - let's keep some sustain and then decay
15:07 - and for decay let's do
15:09 - kind of reverse of this curve so it
15:11 - starts off high and goes down slow then
15:13 - also on the velocity we want this one to
15:15 - be quite a bit more intense
15:17 - then we also want to trigger the zombie
15:19 - getting shot so that's another event so
15:21 - let's add a new event
15:23 - and up here on the play events let's
15:25 - drag the script and call the function
15:28 - okay just zombie hit also don't forget
15:30 - the timing
15:31 - so for the scene machine impulse the
15:33 - really nice shake let's put it after
15:35 - three seconds so as soon as the bullet
15:36 - fires it fires that one then for the
15:38 - zombie getting hit let's put a bit more
15:40 - so maybe 3.05 and before that let's also
15:43 - activate the second camera so just do
15:46 - the exact same thing go into game object
15:48 - set active let's drag the action camera
15:50 - to
15:51 - and we're going to set it to active okay
15:53 - so that's a bunch more effects now it
15:55 - would also be really cool to have a slow
15:57 - motion effect so let's do that let's add
15:59 - new feedback let's go down here into
16:01 - time and let's set a time scale modifier
16:04 - and this one just like it says on the
16:05 - note here this one triggers a timescale
16:07 - event but we need an object with a time
16:09 - manager so let's do that just create a
16:11 - new empty game object
16:14 - and then we add a component once again
16:16 - go into more mountains and let's add a
16:19 - time manager another nice effect would
16:21 - be to add some chromatic aberration so
16:23 - let's add new feedback and that one is a
16:25 - post-processing effect so let's go into
16:27 - this one and now here i'm working in urp
16:29 - so that's what we're going to use let's
16:30 - add a chromatic aberration urp and again
16:33 - make sure to read the note so as you can
16:34 - see the volume component needs to also
16:36 - have this component
16:38 - so on the object where you have the
16:39 - volume component just go ahead and
16:41 - attach this component as well then here
16:43 - in the settings you've got the intensity
16:44 - so once again this is an animation curve
16:46 - so you can play around the shape with
16:47 - the intensity and so on okay so i just
16:49 - added some more effects a bloom one
16:51 - distortion and so on
16:53 - so now i'd like to test all of them at
16:54 - once but so far we've been testing them
16:56 - by clicking on the editor button that's
16:58 - obviously not ideal so now it's time to
17:00 - trigger all this through code which is
17:02 - really easy over here is my script with
17:04 - my very simple logic all we really need
17:06 - is first the using statement so using
17:10 - this one is inside more mountains than
17:12 - inside feedbacks
17:14 - and then let's add a serialized field
17:17 - for the type is of type mm feedbacks
17:19 - there's an s
17:21 - so there are two classes make sure you
17:23 - put the one on the s
17:26 - and just mm feedbacks
17:29 - then down here instead of calling these
17:31 - functions manually these are going to be
17:32 - called by the mm feedbacks so we just go
17:35 - here and we call play feedbacks
17:37 - and that's it very simple so here in the
17:39 - editor we really just need to assign
17:41 - that reference and we can test okay so
17:44 - here i am and now instead of using the
17:45 - debug button i'm going to press on space
17:47 - to take my action so i take my action
17:50 - and there you go the camera changes
17:52 - zooms in starts playing starts shaking
17:54 - and shoots a zombie everything nice slow
17:56 - motion nice lens distortion of that
17:58 - looking really awesome so here it is
18:00 - again with the camera the zoom the shake
18:02 - the particles then the bullet is fired
18:04 - then the zombie the slow motion and all
18:06 - of those really nice effects so compare
18:09 - this one with the version without any of
18:11 - these effects and you can see a huge
18:12 - difference in just a few minutes we
18:14 - turned a boring demo into something
18:16 - pretty awesome also one quick note here
18:18 - in this demo i built all the logic of
18:20 - these effects in a single mm feedbacks
18:22 - component so this is one approach
18:25 - but like you saw in the official demos a
18:26 - possibly better approaches to actually
18:28 - separate them so if this was a real game
18:30 - i would now refactor this logic just to
18:32 - separate the shot feedbacks from the
18:34 - zombie dead feedbacks to do that really
18:36 - you just make another object with the
18:37 - effects for the second part then on the
18:39 - first one you would add an event trigger
18:41 - the second one and so on basically the
18:43 - more separate you keep on logic the
18:44 - easier it is to understand how it all
18:46 - works and you end up with fewer timing
18:48 - dependencies alright so that's feel it's
18:50 - a great asset to very easily add tons of
18:52 - polish to your game polish is really
18:55 - what separates good games from great
18:56 - games so definitely spend some time
18:58 - polishing all of your actions and with
19:00 - this asset it really makes that process
19:02 - very simple you can see how quickly i
19:04 - turned the demo scene going from boring
19:06 - to awesome and like i said this asset is
19:09 - actually three in one i just covered the
19:11 - mm feedbacks part but if you're working
19:13 - on mobile this one also includes the
19:15 - nice vibrations haptics package and it
19:17 - also has tons of useful tools so all
19:19 - that is included in this one asset so
19:21 - based on how much polish effects and
19:23 - level of success that you can find with
19:25 - your games i can highly recommend this
19:27 - asset and don't forget to check out
