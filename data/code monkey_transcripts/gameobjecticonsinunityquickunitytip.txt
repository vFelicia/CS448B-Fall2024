00:01 - hi there this is a quick tip for how to
00:04 - assign icons to a game object so over
00:07 - here is my scene window and if I select
00:09 - the game object and here is the
00:11 - inspector with the selected game object
00:13 - here it has a name and here it says the
00:15 - game object is enabled then here on the
00:18 - web side we have a very nice icon now
00:21 - here in the scene view since this game
00:23 - object doesn't have any visual component
00:25 - you can't actually see anything so if
00:28 - it's not selected then I have no idea
00:30 - where it actually is there's one there
00:31 - and one in there so one thing we can do
00:34 - is go over here into this button and we
00:36 - can select an icon and if you select one
00:39 - of these you can click on it and there
00:41 - you go you can now see the name of the
00:43 - game object with a colored background
00:45 - this way you can visually see where the
00:48 - game object is and if you go into the
00:50 - game window you can also click in here
00:52 - in order to enable gizmos and you can
00:53 - see it in the game window as well so for
00:56 - example something that I always find
00:57 - very useful in my games is to always
00:59 - have a game object named pointer and I
01:02 - simply drag a background and so I can
01:06 - easily drag this object visually in my
01:08 - scene and then I can look in here to see
01:10 - this position is on 4240 so some
01:14 - lighting that shows you the background
01:15 - and you can change the various colors
01:17 - however you can also select an icon you
01:21 - can choose one of these preset icons so
01:23 - for example like that this one and for
01:25 - this player game object and let's add
01:27 - this icon so there is those are now
01:30 - visible and if you have a specific icon
01:33 - text you don't like in here in my
01:35 - project files I have two nice textures
01:37 - and I can replace them by click on other
01:39 - and select that texture so there you go
01:41 - there's one and on the my game object
01:44 - what's also at the other texture and
01:45 - just like that
01:47 - all these objects are now visible in the
01:49 - scene so I can easily locate them and if
01:51 - I go into game scene and they won't get
01:53 - moves I can also see them one more thing
01:56 - is here on the scene window if you're
01:58 - working in 2d you need to come into the
02:00 - gizmos and disable 3d icons if you don't
02:04 - then the 3d icons won't be dependent on
02:07 - the size of your
02:09 - zooom so always is a from them when
02:11 - working in 2d so if you build your game
02:14 - using game objects to the level design
02:16 - then using iPhones can make the process
02:18 - much much easier and that's it hope you
02:21 - found this tip useful alright see you
02:23 - next time
