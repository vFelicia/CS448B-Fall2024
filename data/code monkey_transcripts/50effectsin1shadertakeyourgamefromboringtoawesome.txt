00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:01 - and here let's check out a really
00:03 - awesome asset the all-in-one sprite
00:05 - shader this is a very easy way to add
00:07 - tons of polish into your game to make it
00:09 - just that extra bit awesome this video
00:11 - is split in two parts first let's look
00:13 - at the official demos and see what the
00:15 - essence can do and how they work and
00:16 - then after that i won't do a
00:18 - step-by-step guide on how to start using
00:19 - it and actually add it to your games
00:21 - check out the entire asset review
00:23 - playlist where i highlight great assets
00:24 - to help you make your games awesome this
00:26 - video is sponsored by unity which is
00:28 - currently running the massive black
00:29 - friday sale on the unity assessor
00:31 - there's over 500 assets all heavily
00:33 - discounted everything from tools to
00:35 - models animations and tons of effects on
00:37 - top of that this sale also has lightning
00:39 - deals which start at 90 off and slowly
00:42 - go down in discount as more and more
00:43 - people buy the asset so that means that
00:45 - if you get it quickly you can get a
00:46 - massive discount i also made a video and
00:48 - a list covering some of the best
00:50 - highlights the sale is on until the 4th
00:52 - of december so check it out with a link
00:54 - in the description and this asset the
00:56 - all-in-one sprite shader is also
00:57 - discounted as part of the sale so if you
00:59 - like what you see in this video go ahead
01:01 - and pick it up before the discount ends
01:03 - and if you're watching this after the
01:04 - sale is over then you can instead use
01:06 - the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off
01:08 - your order so the all-in-one sprite
01:10 - shader like the name implies this one is
01:12 - a combination of tons of sprite shader
01:14 - effects all in a single shader so you
01:16 - can very easily add them to any sprite
01:18 - to give it that extra bit of polish or
01:20 - you can also combine them to make some
01:22 - truly unique effects then of course you
01:24 - can animate all the properties and
01:25 - enable or disable the infects in runtime
01:27 - all these effects work on sprites and
01:29 - also on really any renderer so you can
01:31 - use it with particles use it with the
01:33 - tile map the sprite shade or for example
01:35 - in the ui so you can pause your ui with
01:38 - tons of these effects make it flash jump
01:40 - around add some gradients some glow and
01:42 - so on the acid has 150 reviews with a 5
01:45 - star rating so if your game is in 2d
01:47 - then this asset is a no-brainer so here
01:49 - i've got my project and i imported the
01:51 - package now the main thing that you see
01:53 - is over here there's a file with the
01:54 - documentation it's a really detailed pdf
01:57 - file lots of instructions and details
01:59 - all very in-depth and when you install
02:01 - the package the demo scenes work
02:03 - regardless of your render pipeline the
02:05 - shader is made to work with any pipeline
02:06 - so it automatically identifies which one
02:08 - you're using and everything works
02:10 - flawlessly so if you're using the
02:12 - built-in urp or agrp then it works
02:14 - instantly now urp does have a 2d
02:16 - specific renderer which uses 2d lights
02:18 - so there's also over here a package this
02:21 - one includes a second demo scene made
02:23 - with those urp lights so just double
02:25 - click on it and import the whole thing
02:28 - then of course make sure you're using
02:29 - urp so go into edit project settings and
02:32 - over here in graphics there's an
02:33 - included urp asset so make sure you use
02:36 - that one and then the folder go inside
02:38 - urp and then open up the demo original
02:40 - urp now one thing according to the
02:43 - documentation the settings on this demo
02:45 - are supposedly meant to work with the
02:46 - gamma color space this is meant to be
02:48 - mobile friendly so i assume that's why
02:50 - if you don't know how to set the color
02:52 - space you go into edit then down into
02:54 - project settings then over here go into
02:56 - the player go down into the other
02:58 - settings and over here you've got the
02:59 - color space so if you're working on
03:00 - mobile usually you'd use gamma because
03:02 - it's more performant but on desktop
03:04 - usually you'd go with linear since it
03:05 - tends to look a bit better either way
03:07 - this asset works with both you just need
03:09 - different settings with regards to the
03:10 - light intensity
03:11 - so for example over here i'm using
03:13 - linear and the glow effect isn't really
03:15 - glowing
03:16 - so by default if you expand the camera
03:18 - inside you've got the urp volume so here
03:20 - it's got the post crossing so it's got
03:21 - bloom
03:22 - and here the threshold is set really
03:24 - high in the intensity real low but if
03:26 - you set both of these to one then you
03:28 - have now it closed properly so keep in
03:29 - mind you can use any color space just
03:31 - make sure you set your values
03:32 - accordingly okay so this asset actually
03:34 - comes with two great demos let's first
03:37 - see this one this one is perfect for
03:38 - seeing all the various effects that you
03:40 - can use so this one is the base normal
03:42 - sprite and in this demo just use the
03:44 - controls to see all the various things
03:45 - so you've got a glow a fade an outline
03:48 - textured outline some more you've got an
03:50 - inner outline this one looks great some
03:52 - gradient a radial gradient for some
03:54 - reason this one isn't working with the
03:55 - demo but the effect does work then some
03:57 - color swap also really interesting hue
03:59 - shift changes one color color ramp and
04:01 - so on a nice hit effect a nice negative
04:05 - you can pixelate making grayscale and so
04:07 - on so as you can see tons and tons of
04:09 - bass effects so these are the various
04:11 - color effects and then if you use the
04:14 - keys to go down over here you see a
04:16 - bunch of uv effects so these modify
04:18 - quite a lot of things about the sprites
04:19 - for example this hand drawn effect looks
04:21 - really nice a nice little wind some wave
04:24 - round wave some offset
04:28 - over here really nice zoom some really
04:30 - cool distortion twisting and so on so
04:33 - you can see tons and tons of things that
04:35 - you can apply and the point is that you
04:37 - can combine both them so you can combine
04:38 - the color effects up here with uv
04:40 - effects on here so if you go down here
04:42 - you can see the effect combinations and
04:43 - you can see all of them so here's a
04:45 - really nice burn so you got an outline
04:47 - as well some fade you got a hologram
04:50 - you got a really interesting one an evil
04:52 - marine and so on so as you can see tons
04:54 - and tons of things you can mix and match
04:56 - all these effects and get pretty much
04:58 - anything you can imagine
05:09 - all right so this is the first demo as
05:11 - you can see tons and tons of possible
05:12 - use cases all of them are using the
05:14 - exact same shader and all these effects
05:15 - are usable with any sprite or even any
05:17 - ui element then here is the second demo
05:20 - this one is a really nice scene looks
05:22 - pretty natural like it's part of a real
05:23 - game
05:24 - and also this demo is meant to
05:25 - demonstrate how the effects work with td
05:27 - and lights so that one back there is
05:29 - being illuminated normal lights as i
05:31 - pass in the light with the camera as you
05:32 - can see everything looks great and it
05:34 - all works pretty perfectly alright so
05:36 - now that we've seen what the effect can
05:38 - do let's see how you can use it in your
05:39 - own game by the way if you find the
05:41 - video helpful please hit the like button
05:43 - it's a tiny thing but it really does
05:44 - help thanks like i said the asset comes
05:46 - with a great documentation so definitely
05:48 - check that out and there's also some
05:50 - super quick video tutorials it's really
05:53 - easy to set it up so let's see how to do
05:55 - it so over here i've got my game using
05:57 - my own custom sprites so i can move my
05:59 - camera i can shoot some bullets and i
06:01 - can hit those targets
06:02 - so this demo scene here is pretty much
06:05 - the same one that i used in the shoot
06:06 - projectiles video where i covered
06:07 - multiple methods of handling projectiles
06:10 - so just a really nice base scene and
06:12 - over here i've got a really nice star
06:14 - this one is meant to be a power up so as
06:16 - i go i approach and i touch and i pick
06:18 - it up
06:19 - now just like this this power up
06:20 - definitely doesn't look too special so
06:22 - let's use this really nice asset to add
06:24 - some effects so over here in my scene
06:26 - i've got my star and inside the sprite
06:28 - okay that's it just a spread render
06:30 - nothing else now the first thing you
06:31 - need is to add a component and add the
06:33 - all-in-one shader component and when you
06:35 - do it automatically modifies the sprite
06:37 - material to use the shader so it adds a
06:39 - component and if you expand upon this
06:41 - material yup now you see all the various
06:43 - effects that you can add so for example
06:45 - maybe let's make the sprite glow a
06:47 - little bit
06:48 - then maybe also add an outline
06:53 - you can make the outline use some
06:54 - distortion
06:55 - there you go really nice and maybe a
06:57 - nice hand-drawn effect this one looks
06:59 - really nice alright so there it is now
07:01 - it looks much more special and you can
07:03 - see just how easy it was at all these
07:05 - effects to make this power up feel
07:07 - completely different much more powerful
07:09 - now one quick note here if you have
07:10 - issues with some of these effects then
07:12 - it's likely because the sprite is too
07:13 - tight if you go up here and change from
07:15 - shaded into wireframe you can see the
07:17 - actual mesh shape
07:19 - now some of these effects like this
07:20 - outline they need a little bit extra
07:22 - space to render
07:23 - so if the mesh is way too tight then
07:25 - they might not look correct
07:27 - so for that just make sure you select
07:28 - your sprite and over here on the mesh
07:30 - type you can change from tight which
07:32 - will make it have this shape it tries to
07:34 - cut off all the alpha as much as
07:35 - possible but you can set it to phone
07:38 - rect so now the mesh is a quad which
07:40 - means it has a lot more space for
07:41 - distortion or outlines or any other
07:43 - effects same thing if you're working
07:45 - with a sprite atlas just make sure
07:46 - there's enough space for every effect
07:49 - now the way that this asset saves all of
07:50 - the effects data is in an interesting
07:52 - way when you add this script it
07:54 - automatically assigns a material that is
07:56 - dynamically generated so this way you
07:58 - don't need any extra assets on your
07:59 - project folder the data is instead saved
08:02 - along with the scene file so that's
08:04 - great no more files no more clutter but
08:06 - that also means that if the object isn't
08:07 - in a scene then this method does not
08:09 - work
08:10 - for example if i take off the star and i
08:12 - make it into a prefab and i open the
08:14 - prefab and nope there's no effects so
08:16 - all the effects are now gone so all that
08:18 - that is completely lost so for anything
08:20 - that exists outside of a scene like a
08:23 - prefab you need to make a proper
08:24 - material for it now thankfully there's
08:26 - an easy way to do just that it's over
08:28 - here on the all in one shader component
08:30 - you've got this button save material to
08:32 - folder
08:33 - now if you want to know what folder this
08:35 - is going to save to you can go up here
08:37 - into window and then the all in shader
08:39 - window and over here you see all the
08:40 - defaults and various other things so for
08:42 - example the material save path is over
08:44 - here on the materials folder and if you
08:45 - click on it you see it's inside all in
08:46 - one and you've got the materials so if
08:48 - you take on this and you just click on
08:50 - that and there you go it creates this
08:51 - one let's just rename this to the star
08:53 - so now this one is using that material
08:56 - and now i can safely turn this into a
08:57 - prefab
08:58 - and if i go inside the prefab yep it
09:00 - does work also one quick note here it's
09:02 - not glowing that's simply because in the
09:04 - prefab scene over here we don't have any
09:06 - post pressing but if we are over here in
09:08 - our scene and we just paste it there you
09:10 - go everything works perfectly so now i
09:11 - can spawn as many power-ups as i want
09:13 - and they all have the same material with
09:14 - the same effects now as i mentioned a
09:16 - while ago you can easily animate all of
09:18 - these effects so all these properties
09:20 - are emittable so let's see how to do
09:22 - that
09:22 - over here on the target i already have a
09:25 - nice animation for when the target is
09:26 - damaged so as i am and i shoot it you
09:29 - can see that nice little animation so
09:31 - let's add some more effects and animate
09:32 - it so once again we add the component
09:34 - first of all then down here and let's
09:36 - use a bunch of things one of the effects
09:38 - is a hit effect so this one is perfect
09:40 - for hitting and then slowly bringing it
09:42 - down
09:43 - so just open up the animation window and
09:45 - over here this one already has this
09:47 - animation so it just moves the sprite to
09:48 - the side and over here just need to hit
09:50 - on record and first of all when it hits
09:52 - let's put this one on one then go back
09:54 - there and bring it back down to zero and
09:56 - yep now if we play yup now we do see the
09:58 - effect
09:59 - all right so here i am as i shoot it yep
10:01 - there you go now i've got some real nice
10:02 - effects and all of them nicely animated
10:05 - alright awesome so that's one way to
10:07 - modify the effects through an animation
10:10 - another way is directly through code
10:12 - another quick note over here is my
10:14 - player character and i'm not actually
10:15 - using the sprite renderer my character
10:17 - uses a custom animation system which is
10:19 - a mesh render so if i just add the
10:21 - script as usual so i add the all in one
10:23 - script if i do that doesn't actually
10:25 - change the material so this one as you
10:26 - can see it's still using the spritelet
10:28 - default but in order to change it first
10:30 - over here on shader variant change it to
10:31 - default and when you do it automatically
10:34 - modifies the shader so now my material
10:36 - still exists in my project files and now
10:37 - it's using that shader and i can apply
10:39 - all the effects that i want so over here
10:41 - on this material i added just the glow
10:43 - effect now this is meant to be the
10:44 - special shader material so as the player
10:46 - picks up the power up it should enable
10:48 - these effects and when the power up
10:50 - expires they should get disabled so
10:51 - that's the goal let's see how we can
10:53 - modify these through code it's actually
10:55 - quite simple it's the same way as any
10:57 - other shader property so here is my
10:59 - player script just got some basic
11:01 - power-up logic so just a timer counts
11:02 - down then you got the power-up stopped
11:04 - and listens to a trigger enter when it
11:05 - hits with a star then we've got the
11:07 - player picked up star so it starts the
11:09 - power-up and then stops
11:10 - so over here let's modify those effects
11:12 - first thing we need is the actual
11:14 - material reference
11:18 - so i'm adding here as a serialized field
11:20 - and now in the editor just drag the
11:21 - reference okay and now here i just want
11:23 - to go into the material and i want to
11:24 - modify the glow
11:26 - so like i said as with any other shader
11:28 - you call material.setfloat
11:30 - if you're modifying a float
11:32 - then this one takes a name for the
11:34 - actual material property
11:35 - so for all of the property names there
11:37 - it's written directly in the shader so
11:39 - if you select the shading over here
11:40 - click on edit it opens up the actual
11:42 - shader file and over here you can see
11:44 - all the properties so for example for
11:46 - the glow you've got the underscore glow
11:48 - or alternatively they're also over here
11:50 - on documentation if you scroll all the
11:51 - way down
11:52 - yep here you've got all the properties
11:54 - so for example for glow you've got the
11:56 - underscore glow so this is the one that
11:58 - i want to modify
11:59 - so modify the underscore glow and when
12:01 - the power up starts let's put it maybe
12:03 - on 30
12:04 - and when the power up ends let's put it
12:06 - back to zero okay so let's see
12:09 - so here i am my player does not have any
12:11 - glow and as soon as i go in yep there
12:12 - you go i get a glow and after three
12:14 - seconds if there you go no more glow all
12:17 - right awesome and of course you can
12:19 - apply some simple smoothing in order to
12:20 - make it less instant so right now it
12:22 - instantly goes and instantly goes away
12:24 - let's apply some smoothing so for that
12:26 - instead of setting it just once
12:28 - let's do up here on our update
12:41 - all right so just the same thing just
12:42 - using meth.lyric in order to smoothly
12:44 - interpolate it
12:46 - all right so here and as i pick it up
12:48 - there you go now it's nice and smooth
12:50 - and for going away yep nice and smooth
12:52 - so you see how by combining those with a
12:54 - proper tweening library you can see how
12:56 - easy it is to control
12:58 - so here i applied a whole bunch more
13:00 - effects and if i pick it up yep there
13:02 - you go nice and smooth look down looking
13:04 - really nice and yep then it goes away as
13:06 - you can see tons of effects really nice
13:08 - really nicely smooth
13:10 - all right awesome and like i mentioned
13:12 - this works on any renderer so here the
13:14 - bonelet has a trail renderer and it's
13:16 - using a material and i'm using this and
13:18 - apply a bunch of effects and yep there's
13:20 - the bonelet with a really nice glow so i
13:22 - can pick it up go into my super
13:25 - and then the super ends and then i pick
13:26 - it up again and everything looks really
13:28 - nicely awesome so nicely animated and
13:30 - then yep really good
13:32 - so if you compare the before and after
13:34 - you can see quite a drastic change and
13:35 - all it took was just a few minutes to
13:37 - set it up so you can see how by
13:39 - combining all these individual effects
13:40 - by animating them either through
13:42 - animations or through code by doing all
13:44 - of that you can really make an infinite
13:46 - amount of variation alright so that's
13:47 - the all-in-one sprite shader if you've
13:49 - got a 2d game then i would highly
13:51 - recommend you look into this asset
13:53 - adding all kinds of effects to your game
13:54 - will give it that extra bit of polish to
13:56 - make it truly stand out it is super easy
13:58 - to use and all of the effects work great
14:00 - so the fact that it has 150 five star
14:03 - reviews definitely checks out and don't
