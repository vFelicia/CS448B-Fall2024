00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're going to make a
00:03 - character portrait that will display a
00:05 - view of our character in a small window
00:07 - in our UI let's get started
00:12 - so here's my scene and I have a
00:14 - character in here moving between
00:16 - waypoints we want to create a UI window
00:19 - that won't display a view of this
00:20 - character as it's moving around so much
00:23 - sir off by creating the UI window let's
00:25 - go into the canvas and create an empty
00:27 - game object and name it window character
00:31 - portrait let's make another game object
00:33 - inside call it background then let's
00:40 - resize the character window let's give
00:43 - the background image okay here's my
00:47 - window with a background now let's make
00:49 - another game object and this let's name
00:53 - it raw image because inside we're going
00:56 - to add a component raw image the
00:59 - difference between a raw image and the
01:00 - normal image component is that the wrong
01:02 - image supports displaying a texture 2d
01:05 - instead of just a sprite
01:06 - this is what we're going to use to
01:08 - display our camera texture so let's put
01:10 - it about that and like that all right
01:13 - now let's create our camera this is the
01:16 - camera that won't follow the character
01:17 - making you empty game object give it a
01:20 - camera component make it a 2d camera so
01:24 - orthographic give it a 10 for the size
01:28 - and let's name it camera okay so instead
01:32 - of drawing this camera to the screen
01:34 - we're going to draw it into a texture
01:36 - nor do that let's go into our project
01:38 - bounce and create a new rendered texture
01:41 - named it character portrait render
01:45 - texture okay make it 512 by 512
01:48 - now this size off is only going to
01:50 - depend on how big you expect define on
01:52 - window to be and let's apply this render
01:56 - texture to our camera so the view of
01:58 - this camera won't be rendered into this
01:59 - rendered texture and we're going to
02:02 - display this rendered texture in our
02:03 - image so as you can see right now it
02:05 - shows black but if we move our camera
02:09 - like that we can now see in the camera
02:11 - preview and in our raw image where we
02:14 - see the camera view okay great in-game
02:16 - you can view the camera in here and the
02:19 - cameras position in here and there you
02:21 - go the
02:21 - removes and you see it correctly okay so
02:23 - now that our window is set up let's
02:25 - write the code make a new script c-sharp
02:28 - script and name its window character
02:31 - portrait now inside on our private voice
02:35 - awake let's grab a reference to our
02:38 - camera transform so make a private
02:41 - transform camera transform and we're
02:44 - going to grab that in here can we
02:46 - transform Nichols transform dot find the
02:49 - camera we're going to have a public void
02:52 - show this is the function that will be
02:54 - called to show our window inside let's
02:57 - receive a transform for our follow
02:59 - transform and we're going to store it as
03:02 - a member variable so and let's set this
03:08 - game object that's set active to true so
03:11 - that it's visible and on our public void
03:15 - behind we're going to do the opposite so
03:18 - we're going to set the active to false
03:19 - and on awake let's hi so this window
03:24 - starts off hidden okay so now let's make
03:27 - the update make a private void update
03:30 - and inside we're going to place our
03:32 - camera on top of the font transform so
03:35 - we're going to take our camera transform
03:38 - dot position and we're going to place it
03:41 - on a new vector3 of the follow transform
03:44 - position X so our transform position
03:48 - down why the Zed is going to depend on
03:50 - how you set up your main camera so in
03:52 - this case I'm just going to put it on
03:54 - the camera dot main transform position
03:57 - dot Z so it's at exactly the same height
04:00 - as my main camera okay so this should
04:02 - correctly be placing the camera on top
04:05 - of the follow transform so now on our
04:08 - game Hamelin I have my camera follow
04:10 - script in here it is simply moving the
04:12 - camera with the wsad keys let's make
04:16 - another serialized feel but for our
04:20 - window character portraits window
04:22 - character portrait and let's make a
04:27 - transform for our character transform
04:31 - okay so now on our private voice starts
04:35 - let's go into the window character
04:37 - portrait and show and give the key
04:40 - character transform so first the
04:42 - character portrait sets up on the things
04:44 - on awake and then game hemler start
04:46 - execute and it's going to show the
04:48 - character portrait using the character
04:50 - transform all right let's see if the
04:53 - window shows let's add our references
04:58 - all right there you as you can see how
05:01 - uiwindow is in here and it is displaying
05:04 - a view of the camera and the camera is
05:06 - being placed on top of the character
05:08 - which is moving around so now let's set
05:11 - the ability to show and hide our window
05:13 - on the editor let's add a button to
05:15 - close our window I'm going to add the
05:26 - button UI component which is part of the
05:28 - code monkey utilities which is always
05:30 - you can wear app for free from unity
05:31 - code monkey comm this is just a simple
05:34 - script that allows me to easily set up
05:35 - UI clicks so in our code on the window
05:39 - for the character portrait let's set up
05:41 - the click so going to transform find my
05:45 - clothes button get the components of
05:48 - type button UI which is part of the
05:51 - using code monkey dot utils and on the
05:55 - button UI I have a click phone which is
05:58 - an action that is triggered when the
06:00 - player clicks on the button so this
06:04 - action will do essentially just the hide
06:07 - function so when I click the close
06:08 - button it's going to execute the hide
06:10 - function which is going to hide our
06:11 - window okay there's my window there's my
06:14 - close button when I click the window
06:15 - hides great now let's have a button to
06:18 - click on our character and show the
06:20 - window so here's my character game
06:22 - object I'm going to add a box Collider
06:25 - 2d and size it to just about occupy the
06:29 - size of the character so just like that
06:31 - and I'm going to add a button sprite
06:34 - which is also part of the code monkey
06:36 - utilities and then the game hammer using
06:38 - the character transform I'm
06:40 - to go into the character transfer get
06:42 - the component of type 'button sprites
06:44 - and I'm going to set the click func
06:47 - to trigger this action and inside I'm
06:51 - going to trigger the show function
06:54 - alright let's see if I can click on the
06:56 - character to show and then click the
06:57 - close button to hide the window ok the
07:00 - window is not visible
07:01 - there's my character and if I click on
07:03 - it and there you go the window shows up
07:05 - and it has a close button I can close it
07:07 - again alright there you go I can open
07:09 - and close and looks great awesome
07:11 - so there you have it we have created a
07:14 - UI window that you can use to show a
07:15 - view of a character or building in your
07:18 - game in the next video we're going to
07:20 - add support for multiple windows as
07:22 - always you can download the project
07:24 - files in utilities from Unity code
07:25 - monkey comm if you have any questions
07:27 - post them in the comments and I'll do my
07:29 - best to answer them subscribe for more
07:31 - videos and I'll see you next time
