00:35 - some great game design tips using these
00:37 - games as examples
00:38 - and also to highlight excellent games
00:40 - made with unity so you know the only
00:42 - limits to building the game of your
00:43 - dreams is really just your own skills
00:45 - check on the reviews in the same curator
00:47 - or the playlist oh and by the way the
00:49 - latest unity mega bundle ends in a few
00:50 - days
00:51 - so if you want eight hundred dollars
00:53 - worth of awesome assets at 96
00:55 - off then check the link in the
00:56 - description before it ends so valheim is
00:59 - a viking inspired open world game
01:00 - focused on free exploration and emergent
01:03 - gameplay
01:03 - it features survival crafting mechanics
01:05 - set in a unique procedurally generated
01:07 - world
01:08 - fight through this world alone or play
01:10 - with up to 10 friends and conquer
01:11 - valhalla together
01:13 - you are dropped off on this brand new
01:14 - world and begin harvesting simple
01:16 - resources and fighting small enemies
01:18 - then you craft some better tools
01:19 - continue gathering more resources and
01:21 - exploring the world until you find the
01:23 - perfect spot for your very first base
01:25 - the game features a robust building
01:27 - system adaptable to any terrain you can
01:29 - build anywhere
01:30 - place down some walls put up a ceiling
01:31 - and make a nice fire and sleep through
01:33 - the night
01:34 - then wake up continue gathering more
01:35 - items exploring this brand new world and
01:37 - finding more foes to fight
01:39 - it's an rpg where you level up your
01:41 - stats as you do your actions
01:42 - the world is split into several biomes
01:44 - with increasingly higher difficulty and
01:46 - new enemies
01:47 - it features lots of survival mechanics
01:49 - if you're not well dressed you're going
01:50 - to be cold
01:51 - if you're wet it's going to punish your
01:53 - stamina if you're hungry you won't be as
01:55 - strong
01:56 - all of those mechanics really make you
01:57 - feel like you're part of this world
01:58 - without ever being annoying
02:00 - visually the game has a very unique look
02:02 - it blends modern techniques with some
02:04 - low resolution textures
02:05 - the lighting effects make it look
02:07 - gorgeous and combined with the pixelated
02:09 - textures it really gives it a unique
02:11 - look
02:11 - you can definitely spend a ton of time
02:13 - just enjoying the sights either from a
02:14 - mountain or relaxing sailing in the sea
02:17 - all of this and yet the game has only
02:19 - just launched in early access
02:20 - i'm definitely looking forward to seeing
02:22 - how this improves over time what they
02:23 - have here is already a very complete
02:25 - game
02:26 - this is a great example of a massive
02:28 - open world game with a giant
02:29 - procedurally generated world and it's
02:31 - all made with unity
02:32 - and they've already found massive
02:34 - success with over 2 million copies sold
02:36 - in under 2 weeks
02:37 - it's always inspiring to see indie
02:38 - developers finding such massive success
02:41 - if you're into survival and crafting
02:42 - open world exploration games then this
02:44 - is an excellent new entry in the genre
02:46 - now here's my thoughts from my point of
02:48 - view as a game developer as well as some
02:50 - takeaways for how you can improve your
02:52 - own games
02:52 - i will go through each point
02:54 - highlighting what i think the game does
02:55 - well and what lessons you can learn from
02:57 - it
02:57 - and for the very first lesson i'm just
02:59 - going to briefly mention it since i
03:01 - already covered it in detail in the
03:02 - previous game dev review and i don't
03:04 - want to repeat myself too much
03:06 - as i said the game is out in early
03:07 - access the last video was reviewing
03:09 - dyson sphere program which is another
03:11 - game that was also massively successful
03:13 - and also came out in early access
03:15 - that game just like this one is
03:17 - extremely well polished so what i
03:19 - mentioned in that video that i'll
03:20 - briefly mention here
03:21 - is how if you're working on an early
03:23 - access game then this is your
03:24 - competition
03:25 - this is the level of quality that you
03:26 - need to hit nowadays players who buy
03:29 - games even in early access already
03:31 - expect a high level of polish and a
03:32 - complete experience
03:34 - now part of the reason why the game is
03:36 - so good is because the combat and basic
03:38 - action just feels so awesome
03:39 - everything is super punchy even just a
03:42 - basic unarmed punch feels like it has a
03:44 - bunch of power
03:45 - same thing for basic gathering just
03:46 - punching a tree branch it is also
03:48 - incredibly satisfying it's all about the
03:50 - animation timing combined with just the
03:52 - right amount of screen shake along with
03:54 - some really punchy sound effects
03:56 - adds some awesome particle effects when
03:57 - you take down an enemy and it all feels
03:59 - really excellent
04:00 - this is without a doubt one of the main
04:02 - reasons why this game is doing so well
04:04 - the very first actions you take in the
04:05 - game are extremely satisfying which
04:07 - gives you a dopamine hit right away
04:09 - so the lesson for you is make your basic
04:11 - star actions as satisfying as you
04:13 - possibly can
04:14 - remember the very first minutes are
04:16 - extremely important you need to hook the
04:17 - player right away
04:19 - this game is undoubtedly a master class
04:21 - in game feel
04:22 - and this next one builds upon the
04:24 - previous one but it's so good that i
04:26 - really just had to mention it
04:27 - now i have to say that usually i'm not
04:29 - someone who values sound design too much
04:31 - for me as long as there are sound
04:32 - effects in music i don't usually notice
04:35 - if they're good or not
04:36 - however in this game i would say the
04:37 - sound design is definitely excellent
04:42 - every punch feels extremely powerful
04:44 - swinging the pickaxe feels like wielding
04:46 - a shotgun
04:48 - sound design is undoubtedly one of the
04:49 - reasons why this game has found massive
04:51 - success
04:52 - if you replace these sound effects with
04:53 - something weak the game would certainly
04:55 - feel about 90
04:56 - less satisfying by the way if you find
04:58 - the video helpful please hit the like
05:00 - button it's a tiny thing but it really
05:01 - does help
05:02 - thanks and for the next lesson i'm sorry
05:05 - for saying the words satisfying so much
05:07 - but i really do believe that this is the
05:08 - main reason why the game has found so
05:10 - much success
05:11 - the effects for leveling up a skill are
05:13 - also very satisfying
05:15 - again great sound design with some
05:16 - awesome particle effects and it happens
05:18 - instantly on your very first jump
05:20 - so as soon as you enter into the game
05:22 - within the first 30 seconds just by
05:23 - randomly pressing buttons you'll
05:25 - certainly get it
05:26 - so once again another example of just
05:28 - how much they polish the very first five
05:30 - minutes of playtime which is undoubtedly
05:31 - one of the main reasons why this game is
05:33 - so successful
05:35 - then in terms of gathering sadly the
05:37 - game takes the approach that i'm not a
05:39 - fan of
05:39 - it force you to click every time you
05:41 - want to swing now this makes perfect
05:43 - sense with regards to combat you want to
05:44 - keep the player engaged and keep them
05:46 - actively swinging
05:48 - however when it comes to gathering you
05:49 - really should make it easier for the
05:51 - player
05:51 - so one simple tip is don't give your
05:53 - players carpal tunnel
05:54 - and this is something that the game does
05:56 - have in another area in order to grab
05:58 - items from the floor you'll look at it
05:59 - and press e
06:00 - however if you hold down e and move the
06:02 - mouse it does grab whatever you're
06:03 - looking at
06:04 - so chopping some wood and gathering some
06:06 - resources should work very much in the
06:08 - same way
06:09 - related to that it should be clear when
06:10 - you're making progress while gathering
06:12 - resources
06:13 - in the beginning when you're starting
06:14 - out you're unarmed the only way to
06:16 - gather resources by punching a tree
06:18 - you need to punch a tree about 10 times
06:19 - to actually take it down and there's no
06:21 - indication of progress
06:22 - that might confuse some players into
06:24 - think that they're not doing it right
06:26 - maybe it could have a slight progress
06:28 - bar or a health bar on trees and bushes
06:30 - or if that's to immersion breaking then
06:32 - simply changing the visuals slightly
06:33 - just anything at all to show the player
06:35 - that they're doing the correct action
06:37 - you should always give the player
06:38 - feedback the player should never be
06:40 - questioning if the game received a
06:41 - certain input it should always be very
06:43 - clear
06:44 - when you try to pick up an item it says
06:46 - in the corner how many you picked up
06:48 - recently however it does not say the
06:49 - total
06:50 - since a player is likely gathering items
06:52 - to reach a certain total to craft
06:54 - something then it would be very useful
06:55 - to also say the current total
06:57 - always try to think from the point of
06:58 - view of the player try to guess what the
07:00 - player would be thinking while playing
07:01 - your game
07:02 - in this case it would be as simple as
07:04 - adding a total in parentheses
07:06 - easy to add and just one more tiny
07:08 - improvement the building system is a bit
07:10 - fiddly
07:11 - it's freeform instead of a grid system
07:13 - which means it's adaptable to any kind
07:15 - of terrain
07:16 - that's an excellent system for a game
07:18 - with procedurally generated terrain
07:20 - however the snapping is definitely quite
07:21 - fiddly there's a tiny handful of pixels
07:24 - that you need to select to enable
07:25 - proper snapping you should always make
07:27 - it as easy as possible for the player to
07:29 - interact with your
07:30 - systems building is the center point of
07:32 - this game so it should really be as
07:33 - polished and as satisfying as the combat
07:35 - is
07:36 - then the rules for building a house are
07:38 - also not entirely clear
07:40 - the game has a proper shelter mechanic
07:42 - you get some buffs if you're under what
07:44 - the game identifies as a shelter
07:46 - however the floor boards don't seem to
07:48 - count as a roof at least not by
07:50 - themselves
07:50 - i first assumed that i could make a roof
07:52 - out of 4 boards since they are flat
07:53 - pieces whereas all roof pieces are at an
07:56 - angle
07:56 - so due to that i was having some issues
07:58 - making my first shelter i couldn't use
07:59 - the workbench no matter what until i
08:01 - realized that it needed a specific roof
08:03 - tile
08:04 - later on i found some abandoned
08:05 - buildings that do count as a shelter
08:07 - with some
08:08 - floorboards but some of them don't so
08:09 - i'm still not clear on those rules
08:11 - so as a whole i'm a big fan of the
08:13 - shelter mechanic but it does need a bit
08:14 - more explaining on the actual rules
08:17 - the game has something which i
08:18 - definitely love which is when you swing
08:20 - the axe in order to gather some wood it
08:22 - doesn't lock into one specific tree or
08:24 - bush
08:24 - instead it hits whatever objects are
08:26 - within the swing area
08:28 - personally i find this system much
08:30 - better than the method that so many
08:31 - games we use which is to do a raycast
08:33 - and identify the single object together
08:35 - from
08:36 - with this system it adds an element of
08:37 - player skill to the simple action of
08:39 - gathering resources which keeps the
08:40 - player more engaged even when doing
08:42 - basic actions
08:44 - here's one simple tip whenever possible
08:46 - add physics into your world
08:47 - one of the reasons why the simple action
08:49 - of gathering wood feels so good
08:51 - is because the tree doesn't just
08:52 - disappear and give you wood instead
08:54 - big trees get chopped into logs and then
08:56 - those logs fall down with accurate
08:58 - physics
08:59 - the falling law can then fall on top of
09:01 - smaller bushes and turn them into wood
09:03 - or it can fall on top of an enemy or
09:05 - even yourself and deal some damage
09:07 - adding physics is a simple thing but it
09:08 - makes the world feel much more grounded
09:11 - one excellent mechanic is how you can
09:13 - tag any position on the map
09:14 - give it an icon and some text this is
09:17 - especially excellent in this game
09:19 - because the world is procedurally
09:20 - generated
09:21 - every game sees a completely different
09:22 - world so it's up to you to make sense of
09:24 - this completely undiscovered world
09:26 - there are random abandoned buildings
09:28 - scattered throughout the maps some
09:30 - abandoned huts some castles some altars
09:32 - with runes
09:33 - so you can for example tag them to
09:34 - occupy them make your new base or just
09:36 - tag any interesting things you find
09:38 - it's a simple mechanic to add and it
09:40 - perfectly matches with the random
09:41 - generation of the world
09:43 - so for you if you have a procedural
09:44 - world consider adding this mechanic
09:47 - another interesting mechanic is how when
09:49 - you die you drop all items on death
09:51 - this is always a simple way to add some
09:53 - stakes into your game
09:54 - but then it's up to you to decide how
09:56 - intense you want it to be
09:57 - in this case the items stay where you
09:59 - left them so if you pick them up you
10:01 - don't permanently
10:02 - lose items and also the game gives you a
10:04 - nice temporary buff after you die
10:06 - your stamina usage goes down and you
10:08 - take less damage from physical attacks
10:10 - however when you die you also do lose
10:12 - some skill points
10:14 - but again you get another buff when you
10:16 - respawn and that says that if you die
10:17 - you won't lose any more skill points
10:20 - so it really is up to you the designer
10:22 - of your game to define just how high
10:24 - stakes and how punishing you want game
10:25 - that to be
10:26 - in this case the designers weren't going
10:28 - for a super heartless nail and punishing
10:30 - system so they combine the death penalty
10:32 - with some bonuses to let you get back on
10:34 - normal
10:35 - the game is an rpg which features areas
10:37 - of different levels which is always
10:39 - interesting
10:40 - but there are no visible numbers so if
10:42 - you stumble upon a high level area then
10:44 - you might not even be aware of it
10:46 - for this game hiding numbers is a good
10:47 - thing it keeps the world more immersive
10:49 - however in my case as soon as i went
10:51 - accidentally into a high level area i
10:53 - had a wolf chasing me and i could not
10:55 - escape and end up dying
10:57 - again goes back to how punishing you
10:58 - want your game to be based on how they
11:00 - designed that it seems their goal wasn't
11:02 - to make an intensely difficult game
11:04 - so in keeping with that design i think
11:06 - there should be some sort of system to
11:08 - keep the player from dying accidentally
11:09 - by going into a high level area
11:11 - something as simple as having the enemy
11:13 - miss their hits or simply hit the player
11:15 - but leave them at win hp and then pull
11:17 - back at least on the very first
11:19 - encounter
11:20 - remember that the player experience is
11:21 - all that matters making the player feel
11:23 - like they just barely escape death is
11:25 - much more satisfying than instantly
11:27 - losing to a super high level enemy
11:30 - another interesting mechanic is the
11:31 - wrist mechanic whenever you're in a
11:33 - shelter under your roof
11:35 - if you stay there for a while you get a
11:36 - nice restaurant buff
11:38 - it gives you extra stamina and health
11:39 - regen it's a very large bonus so you're
11:41 - definitely encouraged to have the buff
11:43 - active at all times
11:44 - but the buff also has a time limit so
11:47 - what this essentially does is it forces
11:48 - you to return to base or find a shelter
11:50 - every once in a while
11:51 - if you want to encourage the player to
11:53 - feel a connection to their home base
11:54 - then this is a simple and effective way
11:56 - to do it
11:57 - and as always remember that bonuses feel
11:58 - better than punishments
12:00 - note how here they give you a positive
12:02 - buff while you're rested
12:03 - as opposed to a negative buff while
12:05 - unrested always try to present your
12:07 - mechanics in a positive way
12:09 - alright so those are my thoughts on
12:11 - valheim a game made with yinty
12:12 - i very much enjoyed playing this one i
12:14 - hadn't played a survival crafting game
12:16 - in quite a while so this came out at
12:18 - just the right time for me
12:19 - if you want to learn how to make your
12:20 - games as satisfying as possible then i
12:22 - highly recommend you pick this one up
12:24 - and study what makes it so satisfying
12:26 - hooking the player as quickly as
12:28 - possible is an absolute must and i think
12:30 - this game is definitely a master class
