00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code Mohan in
00:02 - this video we're going to figure out how
00:03 - to set the transform pivot to a game
00:05 - object let's begin
00:09 - so here we are in an empty scene now if
00:12 - you're new to unity when the first
00:14 - things you'll need to learn is how to
00:16 - make a health bar so if you want to make
00:18 - it in the world rather than in the UI
00:19 - you won't learn the way to this place
00:21 - right which is first you create an empty
00:23 - game object and then you add these
00:25 - fright renderer component just like that
00:28 - drag the bar sprite and just like that
00:31 - you have something that looks like a
00:32 - health bar however now if you try to
00:35 - scale it you will notice that it scales
00:37 - from the middle so in here you would go
00:38 - into the scale and modify the X and yep
00:41 - there you go it is scaling from the
00:42 - middle so by trying to make it smaller
00:45 - it won't actually scale on both ends now
00:47 - a health bar is usually supposed to
00:49 - scale from right and left so this will
00:52 - not work for what we want to do and I
00:54 - mean here before we go further I should
00:56 - point out that if you're using sprites
00:58 - you can simply go into the health bar
01:00 - import settings and here you can set the
01:03 - sprite pivot so you could set it instead
01:05 - of being in the center set it on the
01:07 - left side click apply and as you can see
01:10 - now the origin of the game object which
01:12 - is right in there is on the left just
01:15 - like we said on the texture and we can
01:17 - now scan on lists normally so we can now
01:18 - move the X and works just like that
01:20 - however for now let's ignore this
01:22 - ability for the purposes of
01:23 - understanding how Unity deals with
01:25 - transforms between parents and children
01:27 - and the difference between local space
01:29 - and world space if you understand how
01:31 - transformers work you will be more
01:33 - capable of creating anything you want
01:35 - for example if you're using the white
01:37 - pixel trick that I normally use you
01:39 - can't modify the texture pivot without a
01:41 - lot of hassle so it pays to know how
01:43 - transformations work so let's reset this
01:46 - back to center and keep looking at how
01:48 - transforms work so essentially a game
01:51 - object will always be transformed from
01:53 - its center it doesn't matter what sprite
01:55 - it has or what box Collider is attached
01:57 - to it the transformations are always
02:00 - done from the origin of that game object
02:02 - so in order to essentially change the
02:04 - pivot you need to be tricky with how you
02:07 - position your child game objects so here
02:09 - in the hump bar example we want to go
02:12 - from right to left as it shrinks now in
02:15 - order to do that we can make this game
02:17 - object a child of another game object so
02:19 - let's set the scale back to 1 now let's
02:21 - create another empty game
02:23 - object let's place it on zero zero
02:26 - same thing for this one let's call this
02:30 - our health bar and let's call this our
02:32 - health bar sprite and then we make this
02:35 - one a child of our container game object
02:38 - right here the values that you see are
02:40 - the unlocking values so if I put the
02:42 - parent and let's say on 10 0 and we
02:45 - check out the inspector for the child it
02:47 - does say zero zero again this is the
02:49 - unload composition for this game object
02:51 - same thing with the scale and all the
02:53 - other so if I scale by to check out that
02:55 - one and it still says just one so let's
02:59 - reset this back to zero back to 1 and
03:01 - now if we modify the scale of the parent
03:03 - we still have exactly the same thing
03:05 - happening however by moving the child we
03:08 - can essentially change the pivot of the
03:09 - transformations when we transform the
03:11 - parent so in order to achieve our
03:13 - desired effect of scaling from right and
03:15 - left let's shift the inner bar sprite to
03:18 - the right now in here how much you shift
03:21 - won't depend on the scale in this case
03:23 - let's see the texture the texture is 512
03:26 - of width and we're using 512 less pixels
03:29 - per unit so that means the actual size
03:31 - on our game engine is one unit so if the
03:34 - sprite is 1 unit and we shifted by 0.5
03:37 - you can see that he pivot on the parent
03:39 - is exactly on the inlet side and now if
03:41 - we transform the parent let's go in here
03:43 - and modify this key under X and you can
03:45 - see that it does indeed scale from right
03:47 - to left so we positioned our inner
03:50 - sprite in such a way that we modified
03:52 - the transform pivot when we modify our
03:54 - parent now in order to make a completed
03:57 - healthbar let's add a background sprite
03:59 - behind it now we don't want the
04:02 - background to be scaled so let's
04:04 - duplicate the sprite however let's make
04:06 - it not a child of that game object
04:17 - so here we have the background using the
04:20 - same texture but tinted in dark we have
04:23 - set the sorting order for this one to be
04:25 - in zero and the sprite to be in ten so
04:27 - the sprite shows up on top and now we
04:29 - can put all of these elements inside a
04:31 - main container for the health bar and
04:38 - just like that we have all the elements
04:40 - that make up a helper now if we want to
04:44 - modify the size of the bar we can simply
04:46 - go into this bar game object and modify
04:49 - the scale and it does scale from right
04:50 - and left the background always keeps the
04:52 - same scale and the sprite get scaled
04:54 - accordingly so that's how you change a
04:57 - pivot in a transform
04:58 - it's all about being tricky with how you
05:01 - place your children compared to your
05:03 - parents now this works for scaling as
05:05 - you saw but it also works for every
05:06 - other transformation so for example
05:09 - let's say I wanted to make a clock so
05:11 - let's create a new sprite and here I'm
05:14 - going to use the white pixel
05:23 - so here is an image with a white pixel
05:26 - and I want to use this one as my clock
05:28 - hand so let's make it rectangular and
05:31 - now in here I want to rotate it so I'm
05:34 - going to move the rotation that said and
05:36 - I want to shift it like that and as you
05:38 - can see right now we have the exact same
05:41 - problem as previously we are rotating
05:43 - from the very center so let's solve this
05:45 - problem the same way we did with our
05:46 - health bar so here we have our comic and
05:52 - container inside we have the object that
05:54 - actually contains the sprite and only
05:56 - shift this object so that the pivot is
05:58 - on the left side so this one has a scale
06:01 - of 4 so we shifted by 2 and again just
06:04 - like with a health bar we now have our
06:06 - clock hand container and we can rotate
06:08 - it on these head and does indeed act
06:10 - like a clock hand so you can see how by
06:13 - modifying the pivot you can create
06:15 - anything you want now let's also look at
06:17 - a scenario where you want to stretch it
06:19 - texture to a certain distance so I want
06:22 - to show this texture going from zero
06:24 - zero all the way over to ten ten now one
06:28 - way we can do it is calculate the
06:29 - midpoint which in this case would be at
06:31 - five five and we rotate the texture to
06:34 - point it or again we can be tricky with
06:37 - how we calculate our pivots and put this
06:39 - just like the one before the container
06:42 - doesn't contain anything and we put it
06:45 - on zero zero and again we shift the bar
06:47 - sprite on the right so just like that so
06:51 - again we have the pivot on the left side
06:53 - and now if you want to hit 1010 we can
06:56 - simply rotate it down the Zed starting
06:58 - from that pivot and then we calculate
07:01 - this game needed and just like that
07:03 - instead of having to come late a mid
07:05 - point you just put it on the origin
07:06 - point it towards the target and scale it
07:08 - accordingly so again if you're working
07:10 - in 2d you can just change the pivot
07:13 - directly here on the texture import
07:15 - settings however in cases where you
07:17 - can't change the pivot or are the only
07:19 - with 3d objects it pays to know how the
07:21 - various positions phases work always
07:23 - remember that the inspector showcases
07:25 - the unlocking transforms and not equal
07:27 - ones so the inner one still says it's on
07:29 - five zero zero and on the parent it says
07:32 - that it's in there so if I shift the bar
07:34 - to the on the X I increase it you can
07:36 - see that
07:37 - phones that way so there you have it
07:39 - will learn how to modify the transform
07:41 - pivot of an object so we can scale and
07:43 - rotate objects just like we wanted as
07:46 - always you can download the project
07:47 - files any Tony's from in Tacoma key calm
07:49 - if you have any questions post them in
07:51 - the comments and I'll do my best to
07:52 - answer them so swear from your videos
07:53 - and I'll see you next time
