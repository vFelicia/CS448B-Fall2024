00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - now if you've been following me for a
00:03 - while you might have noticed that i
00:05 - don't usually participate in game jams
00:07 - every year there's tons and tons of game
00:09 - jams there's at least two modem diaries
00:11 - per year there's the brackets game jam
00:13 - and the gmtk game jam along with
00:15 - countless others
00:16 - there's a lot of them and a lot of
00:17 - people participate and enjoy them and
00:19 - for me i have done a few but only very
00:21 - rarely
00:22 - quite a while ago i did participate in
00:24 - the easy allies game jam just because it
00:27 - was a very interesting set of rules
00:28 - which let me make a very unique rpg and
00:31 - then i also participated in the mixing
00:33 - game jam where i also made an
00:35 - interesting game mixing racing and rts
00:38 - but beyond that i haven't really done
00:39 - any other so here let me tell you why
00:41 - personally for me game gems don't make
00:43 - too much sense now just to be clear this
00:46 - video is not against game jams at all
00:48 - they all have their pros and cons i
00:50 - think they serve a very useful purpose
00:52 - but at the same time i personally have 5
00:54 - reasons on why they no longer make sense
00:56 - to me and maybe they might not make
00:57 - sense to you too and in the end i will
01:00 - also mention some reasons on why you
01:01 - should do game jams okay so game jams a
01:04 - lot of people love them some people are
01:06 - addicted to them and some people get
01:08 - massively stressed out because of them
01:10 - so as to what i think is the main
01:12 - purpose of a game jam i believe it is in
01:14 - gaming the ability to be able to finish
01:16 - games
01:17 - learning how to actually finish a game
01:19 - is definitely a skill and one that as a
01:21 - beginner it is pretty tough to get a lot
01:23 - of people who start making games never
01:25 - actually finish a game
01:26 - so pretty much everyone who starts game
01:28 - development has folders with dozens or
01:30 - even hundreds of unfinished projects
01:32 - that might even have some interesting
01:34 - ideas but were never finished either
01:36 - it's because the developer was
01:38 - interested in the idea or they simply
01:40 - jump to another idea as soon as the less
01:42 - fun parts of game development start
01:43 - coming up so for me i see that as the
01:45 - main purpose of a game jam it's to help
01:47 - you improve your skill of actually
01:49 - finishing games learning how to manage
01:50 - the scope and create a complete
01:52 - experience from start to finish on a
01:54 - fixed schedule
01:55 - and also being able to push through the
01:57 - unless fun parts of game development
01:59 - learning how to do all of that is
02:00 - massively important and if you want to
02:02 - become a game developer you absolutely
02:05 - must learn that skill
02:06 - now as for me if you've been following
02:08 - the channel for a while and you know
02:09 - about my game dev journey then you can
02:11 - probably already see how this benefit of
02:13 - game jams doesn't really apply to me
02:15 - anymore i made a really nice video quite
02:17 - a while ago where i covered my entire
02:19 - game dev journey it's a really nice
02:20 - video so go watch it if you haven't seen
02:22 - it in there i talk about my entire
02:24 - journey which includes making over 40
02:26 - games in over 10 years
02:28 - i started out in flash where each game
02:30 - was kind of like a mini game jam each
02:32 - game was very small and quickly made
02:34 - from start to finish most of those flash
02:36 - games took less than one month to make
02:38 - so the goal was constant learning during
02:41 - those five years that i was working on
02:42 - flash i made a total of about 35
02:44 - complete games and i had maybe 20 more
02:47 - unfinished games going through that
02:48 - process making all of those games did
02:50 - give me pretty much the skill that you
02:51 - get from game gems i learned how to
02:53 - manage scope and actually finish games
02:56 - then when i felt i had at skill that's
02:58 - when i finally transitioned into unity
02:59 - and started making steam games and
03:01 - because of acquiring that skill i never
03:03 - really had issues with finishing my
03:04 - steam games
03:06 - of course some of them did take longer
03:07 - than expected but in the end i always
03:09 - managed to reach the final goal
03:11 - so that's pretty much my number one
03:13 - reason why i don't do game jams it's
03:15 - because the main benefit that they
03:16 - provide which is learning the skill of
03:18 - finishing games that one is really a
03:20 - skill that i'm already pretty good at
03:23 - my next big reason has to do with one of
03:25 - the main limitations that almost every
03:27 - game jam has which is you cannot reuse
03:29 - code you can usually reuse some art
03:32 - audio assets that you have but usually
03:34 - code must be written internally during
03:36 - the game jam on the one hand i can
03:38 - understand why that rule exists it's
03:40 - essentially to stop people from grabbing
03:41 - something they did a long time ago and
03:43 - just repurpose it for a new game jam but
03:46 - on the other hand again if you've been
03:48 - watching this channel for a while you've
03:49 - certainly heard me repeatedly mention
03:51 - the importance of writing good clean
03:53 - reusable code i'm always encouraging you
03:55 - to be as efficient as possible and reuse
03:57 - as much code and previous systems you
03:59 - have as possible
04:01 - for example i have my super useful grid
04:03 - system which i have been building in
04:05 - tons of videos on this channel let's say
04:07 - that i want to make a city builder game
04:08 - for a game jam
04:10 - does it make any sense to discard all of
04:12 - that and remake it from scratch
04:14 - personally i don't think so
04:15 - but again if you are a beginner then
04:17 - rewriting code is actually a great way
04:19 - to improve your skills as a programmer
04:21 - however for me writing yet another
04:23 - health system from scratch for the 50th
04:25 - time really won't improve my skills at
04:27 - all it's really just a waste of time
04:29 - now one good thing is that not all game
04:31 - jams have this restoration for example
04:33 - the breakfast game jam which is one of
04:35 - the most popular ones does not mention
04:37 - code at all
04:38 - and on the gmtk game jam in 2020 the
04:41 - rule was that the vast majority of code
04:43 - must be written during the game jam
04:45 - whereas in the 2021 version it now says
04:47 - that you may reuse some pre-existing
04:49 - code
04:50 - so maybe that means that more and more
04:52 - people are finding the benefits of
04:53 - writing clean reasonable code and the
04:55 - rules are changing to reflect that
04:57 - then for my third reason it is simply
04:59 - stress
05:00 - now i know there are lots of game jam
05:02 - formats but the majority of them do seem
05:04 - to follow the 48 hour rule
05:07 - again this is great especially for
05:08 - beginners for forcing you to make
05:10 - something complete from start to finish
05:12 - in a very tight schedule
05:14 - but on the other hand it also encourages
05:16 - people to do things like skip sleep and
05:18 - work 14 or 16 hour days which is
05:21 - definitely not healthy you might have
05:23 - heard about the term crunch and how it's
05:24 - one of the big problems in the industry
05:26 - game jams pretty much encourage crunch
05:28 - which can definitely create some bad
05:30 - habits and if overdone it can cause some
05:32 - serious physical or mental issues now
05:35 - for me personally i already have quite a
05:37 - lot of difficulty at achieving a nice
05:39 - work-life balance i definitely already
05:41 - work way too much too many hours and too
05:43 - many days so adding a super stressful
05:45 - weekend on top of that isn't really
05:47 - something that i want to do
05:48 - so if you are still a beginner and you
05:51 - are still on the stage where you won't
05:52 - benefit a ton from all the skills you
05:54 - gain in those quick 48 hours
05:56 - then for you all of that added stress
05:58 - might be worth it
06:00 - but if you already have quite a lot of
06:02 - those skills then all you're doing is
06:04 - really just adding a ton more stress
06:05 - onto yourself for little to no benefit
06:08 - so as always consider the pros and cons
06:10 - what you gain and what it costs
06:12 - my fourth reason is kind of what makes a
06:14 - game jam a game gem which is in order to
06:17 - participate you need to start at a
06:19 - specific time and follow a specific
06:20 - theme
06:21 - again this can be a useful limitation
06:23 - for forcing you to come up with a game
06:25 - idea just on the spot so if you have
06:27 - trouble coming up with ideas then this
06:29 - can be massively useful
06:31 - and also the common start time
06:33 - encourages a community all working at
06:35 - the same time which lets you bounce
06:36 - ideas off of others and see how others
06:38 - interpret the same theme differently now
06:40 - for me i already have lots more ideas
06:42 - than i have time to do them i've got
06:44 - tons of ideas i'd love to explore and
06:46 - build a quick prototype so for those it
06:48 - really just makes more sense to do them
06:50 - whenever i have the time rather than
06:52 - waiting for a specific game jam to start
06:54 - and of course it makes more sense to do
06:56 - the ideas that i already have rather
06:57 - than trying to come up with something
06:59 - new based on a game jam theme
07:01 - and my final reason is really pretty
07:03 - standard i'm simply already way too busy
07:05 - with tons of things that i don't really
07:06 - want to do so adding yet another thing
07:08 - on my schedule that won't really provide
07:10 - me much benefit while also having
07:12 - significant costs that really doesn't
07:13 - make much sense there's tons of videos
07:15 - i'd love to make tons of topics i'd love
07:17 - to research
07:18 - so at any moment i have something like
07:20 - 20 to 30 specific video ideas that i
07:23 - really want to make for example i'd love
07:25 - to get back into dots and see what
07:26 - changed in the past year i'd love to do
07:28 - a lot more machine learning experiments
07:30 - i'd like to research the ml api and do
07:33 - some multiplayer tutorials
07:35 - voxels are really interesting so i'd
07:36 - love to research that as well as doing
07:39 - some more basic tutorials and possibly
07:41 - more things on unity visual scripting
07:43 - then i also would like to make one more
07:44 - update to my ultimate unity overview
07:46 - course before the end of this year and
07:48 - of course eventually i'd like to get to
07:50 - work on my next steam game
07:52 - so the limitation for me to do all of
07:54 - that is really just time and i find all
07:56 - those things much more valuable and much
07:58 - more desirable than doing yet another
08:00 - random game jam
08:01 - now since i spent most of this video
08:03 - talking about the reasons to not do a
08:05 - game jam let me quickly mention the
08:06 - reasons why you should do a game gem
08:09 - now the first reason is exactly the same
08:11 - as my other first reason which is to
08:13 - learn how to finish games if this is a
08:15 - skill you don't yet possess then game
08:17 - jams are an excellent way to learn
08:19 - the second reason is that it's great to
08:21 - force you for coming up with game ideas
08:23 - and having a strict deadline to get them
08:25 - built so he teaches you about managing
08:28 - scope and improving your skills as a
08:29 - game designer then one of the best
08:31 - things about game jam is how everyone
08:33 - plays each other's games and gives
08:35 - feedback again this is hugely helpful
08:37 - for improving your skills as a game
08:39 - designer you get some very useful
08:41 - feedback which you can then apply to
08:42 - your other projects
08:44 - also if you're planning on working with
08:46 - others then a game jam is a great time
08:48 - to test out a new team and learn how to
08:50 - best collaborate with others
08:52 - and finally game jams can also be
08:53 - interesting if you just need a break
08:55 - from bigger projects so after spending
08:57 - months or years working on a single
08:59 - project it can be useful to just spend
09:00 - one weekend working on something
09:02 - completely different by doing that then
09:04 - when you get back to your main project
09:06 - you might see it with a fresh new set of
09:07 - eyes which might help you make a better
09:09 - game so those are just some of the
09:11 - reasons on why you should participate in
09:13 - game jams
09:14 - again like i mentioned in the beginning
09:15 - of this video this one is not against
09:17 - game chambers at all
09:19 - as with anything there are pros and cons
09:21 - if you find them useful to you then by
09:23 - all means go ahead and participate and
09:25 - if you've never done a single one then i
09:26 - would definitely encourage you to give
09:28 - it a try all i'm trying to say with this
09:30 - video is that game jams are not
09:31 - universally good and if you become
09:33 - addicted to them and constantly jump
09:35 - from project to project and never begin
09:37 - working on something more complex on a
09:39 - more long-term project then at that
09:41 - point it might be doing more harm than
09:43 - good but as usual it's a personal thing
09:45 - so hopefully with this video you can see
09:47 - my reasons and you can come up with your
09:49 - own list of pros and cons and either to
09:51 - do more game jams or fewer alright hope
09:54 - that's useful check out these videos to
09:55 - learn some more thanks to these awesome
09:58 - patreon supporters for making these
09:59 - videos possible thank you for watching
10:01 - and i'll see you next time
