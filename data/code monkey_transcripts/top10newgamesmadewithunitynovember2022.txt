00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here I'm going to check out the top
00:03 - new games made with the interior lunch
00:05 - in November 22. the reason why I make
00:07 - these videos is to show you everything
00:08 - that the engine can do the only limit is
00:10 - really just your own skills and
00:11 - Imagination the variety and the
00:13 - awesomeness of the game shown here
00:14 - really puts out to the test all of these
00:16 - games are uniquely impressive so don't
00:18 - listen in no particular order except for
00:19 - the number one game that is my personal
00:21 - pick of the month by the way I'm
00:22 - currently working on my own Sim game
00:24 - called total war on Liberation it's a
00:26 - game with tons of systems open world
00:27 - survival and crafting automation
00:29 - strategy check out the same page edit
00:31 - your wishlist and follow for devlogs
00:32 - alright so starting off at number 10
00:34 - with one of the more unique interesting
00:36 - releases this month here is pentment
00:38 - this one is made by obsidian so that's
00:41 - the same Studio that made Fallout New
00:43 - Vegas pillars of Eternity the other ones
00:45 - and a bunch more
00:46 - it's great to see such a big
00:48 - well-established Studio go for Unity for
00:49 - one of their more smaller scale projects
00:51 - the game itself has a very unique look
00:53 - everything looks like it's taken from
00:55 - some kind of medieval parchment the game
00:57 - is a story focused Adventure game so
01:00 - there are lots of choices to make
01:01 - Mysteries to uncover and a very
01:03 - interesting world to explore this one
01:05 - looks like a great game to play in order
01:07 - to research this very unique sound that
01:08 - they have built next up here we have
01:10 - another entry in the highly popular
01:12 - vampire survivors like genre you control
01:15 - a hero against hundreds or thousands of
01:17 - enemies there are tons of particles
01:19 - flying all over the place lots of
01:20 - attacks to a Dodge lots of enemies to
01:22 - study you can choose from 14 characters
01:24 - and build it from a huge selection of
01:26 - over 150 skills there are plenty of
01:28 - bosses to encounter and lots of
01:30 - Randomness to make every run unique
01:31 - there's tons of games like this one
01:33 - nowadays but this one does seem to be
01:35 - one of the better ones also some of you
01:37 - may notice the assets I don't think they
01:39 - are necessarily from cinti but I do
01:41 - think they are from an ass attack and
01:42 - once again note how that did not stop
01:44 - the game from being massively successful
01:46 - it already has over 6 000 very positive
01:49 - reviews and the game costs 10 bucks so
01:50 - this is a huge hit next up here is
01:52 - against the storm this one is an
01:55 - interesting City Builder that mixes
01:56 - elements from something like
01:57 - Civilization within a large hex world
01:59 - and also combines it with some roguelite
02:02 - elements it looks like a very unique
02:04 - very strange mix there are giant lizards
02:07 - and beavers so it's very much a fantasy
02:09 - setting you can build your city explore
02:11 - the world and survive the elements then
02:13 - you will notice City next door connect
02:14 - both of them and keep them both alive
02:16 - the genre mix looks really interesting
02:18 - on this one I'd love to give it a try to
02:20 - see how they mixed all of these
02:21 - mechanics and despite launching in Early
02:23 - Access it has already gathered over 3000
02:26 - overwhelmingly positive reviews so this
02:28 - looks like a great game up next here is
02:30 - a game that looks really awesome but
02:32 - sadly does not appear to be finding much
02:33 - success it is called beneath aressa it's
02:37 - a fighting roguelike deck builder that's
02:39 - a nice mix and Visually the game looks
02:41 - excellent It's got lots of thick
02:43 - outlines some great animations and
02:45 - effects I really like the visual style
02:46 - the game has tons of cards for doing all
02:49 - kinds of actions you go through a random
02:51 - path and try to get to the end
02:53 - so it looks to be very well made with
02:55 - some nice compelling gameplay
02:56 - sadly it only has 180 reviews despite
02:59 - having excellent production value
03:00 - hopefully this is the kind of game that
03:02 - will have a huge tail and sound well
03:04 - over time it definitely looks like a
03:06 - high quality game that should be doing
03:08 - much better than this up next here's one
03:10 - that's kind of a personal pick it's
03:12 - Doraemon story of Seasons Friends of the
03:14 - great Kingdom for me I grew up watching
03:16 - Doraemon I absolutely loved it I dreamed
03:18 - of having a magic pouch where I could
03:19 - grab all kinds of awesome gadgets I used
03:22 - to watch the Spanish dub and watching
03:23 - this is how I actually learn all of the
03:25 - Spanish that I know so this is a bit of
03:27 - a Nostalgia pick for me but the game
03:29 - itself doesn't look pretty interesting
03:30 - it's a farming Village Life Sim game so
03:33 - you grow a bunch of crops you raise some
03:35 - animals then you use a bunch of diamond
03:36 - secret gadgets to help complete a bunch
03:38 - of Quests for some friends visually it
03:40 - looks really great it has some very
03:42 - infinite colors everything looks calming
03:44 - and relaxing and it perfectly matches
03:46 - the source material it even has an
03:48 - interesting two-player mode so if you
03:49 - want to just a chill relaxing time then
03:51 - this looks like some great fun next up
03:53 - for something a lot more intense here is
03:55 - Among Us VR this game is perfect for VR
03:58 - one of the main mechanics in the
04:00 - original game is line of sight so
04:02 - putting it in first person in VR makes
04:03 - so much sense I'm guessing you already
04:05 - know about Among Us one person is an
04:08 - imposter who must kill all of the other
04:09 - crewmates
04:10 - and those crewmates must avoid getting
04:12 - killed while doing all kinds of tasks
04:13 - you can call an emergency meeting and
04:15 - you have proximity voice to talk to
04:17 - those around you so basically if you
04:19 - enjoy Among Us and you have a VR headset
04:21 - then this looks like lots of fun I'd be
04:23 - curious to try it out to see how they
04:24 - implement the tasks in VR up next here's
04:27 - one with a really nice style and some
04:28 - interesting gameplay it's Ship of Fools
04:30 - it's a seafaring cooperative roguelike
04:33 - play with a friend and a bark on a
04:35 - journey explore a randomized world with
04:38 - tons of dangers walking around on every
04:39 - corner
04:40 - you can choose where to go land on some
04:43 - mysterious islands and grab some loot
04:44 - the boat itself is your health bar so
04:46 - make sure you don't let it sink man the
04:48 - Cannons and defend it at all costs so
04:50 - this looks like another great fun Co-op
04:52 - game then for something with some
04:54 - extremely unique gameplay here is the
04:56 - past within it's a two-player Co-op game
04:58 - where one player plays in the past and
05:00 - another one in the future it takes
05:02 - advantage of unity super broad platform
05:04 - support So this game runs on anything
05:07 - so for example you can play on your PC
05:09 - and your partner can play on a phone or
05:11 - a steam deck the game itself is a
05:13 - mystery puzzle Adventure game although
05:15 - the trailer also has some kind of creepy
05:17 - horror Vibes it has 5000 overwhelmingly
05:19 - positive reviews so if you want
05:21 - something unique then this looks great
05:23 - next up here is a fun sandbox game
05:26 - called roboco I'm always a fan of games
05:28 - where you can build things in this one
05:30 - you can build all kinds of robots from
05:32 - tons of different parts and the goal is
05:34 - to build a robot that can achieve the
05:36 - current objective so things like deliver
05:37 - some food to a customer
05:39 - cut some logs break open a pinata and so
05:42 - on it even has programming automation
05:44 - support with python so you can write
05:46 - some actual code and watch a robot go I
05:49 - also really like how all of the
05:50 - characters react to the robot they're
05:52 - all very cartoony with some exaggerated
05:54 - facial expressions
05:55 - also really awesome thing coming in a
05:57 - future update is VR support building
05:59 - robots in VR does sound really awesome
06:01 - and over here at number one for my
06:03 - personal pick of the month here is Lords
06:05 - and villains
06:06 - for some reason villains is written with
06:08 - an e and not an a it's a bit strange but
06:10 - alright
06:11 - it's a colony Sim game set the name of
06:14 - different world you can build houses set
06:16 - up crafting with some complex resource
06:17 - chains collect taxes and deliver them to
06:20 - the crown the villagers themselves
06:21 - manage these warfronts so the prices
06:23 - fluctuate based on supply and demand the
06:26 - unique hook of the game is the concept
06:28 - of dynasties so you don't directly
06:30 - micromanage every villager instead you
06:32 - handle their entire family and all of
06:34 - their descendants you give each family a
06:36 - point of land and manage how much you
06:38 - tax them I like how it seems a bit more
06:40 - chilled than most city builders there's
06:42 - no massive enemy attacks or giant
06:43 - disasters so if you want to manage a
06:46 - colony with a complex economy and some
06:48 - UniQue Ideas then check this out all
06:50 - right so that's 10 awesome new games
06:51 - made with TNT launch in November 22. I
06:54 - hope this list helped you see how the NT
06:56 - engine is capable of building anything
