00:00 - also one quick note specifically on the
00:02 - steam algorithm there are four buckets
00:04 - of reviews which greatly affect
00:05 - visibility if you have less than 10
00:07 - reviews the score isn't even visible
00:10 - this is really bad so you absolutely
00:11 - need to get 10 reviews asap
00:14 - the next one is between 10 and 49
00:16 - reviews
00:17 - at that point you do see the score but
00:19 - it's still pretty bad for visibility
00:21 - the next one is above 50 reviews this is
00:24 - where you want to be as quickly as
00:25 - possible ideally on the first day or
00:27 - maybe second or third by then you should
00:29 - really be at 50 or more reviews if not
00:32 - it's a really tricky start
00:34 - and the final one is at 500 reviews
00:36 - that one is really tricky and that's
00:38 - when you start seeing scores like
00:39 - overwhelmingly positive as you can see
00:41 - this game did not manage to hit 50
00:43 - reviews even now several months after
00:45 - release until it gets that much it's
00:47 - going to be really tricky to attract a
00:49 - large amount of players so my tip to you
00:51 - as a game developer is definitely
00:52 - encourage your players to leave reviews
00:54 - and also my tip to you as a player if
00:56 - there's a game you're playing and you're
00:58 - enjoying it do make sure to write a
00:59 - review they really help the developer
