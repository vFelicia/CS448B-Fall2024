04:42 - okay all right hey everyone I think this
04:45 - is live so just bear with me because I
04:47 - haven't done a live stream in about six
04:50 - months so let me see I think the
04:52 - microphone is a bit too low which way do
04:55 - I is that nope that's quieter and that's
04:59 - that's Lou okay good all right so I
05:02 - think everything's good all right hey
05:04 - everyone how's it going thanks for being
05:06 - here uh let me see make sure everything
05:09 - is working and yep
05:14 - okay should have a 3D model of Code
05:17 - Monkey that could be funny I thought
05:19 - about that I've seen a bunch of virtual
05:21 - characters virtual channels that is an
05:23 - interesting idea so yeah if I could do a
05:25 - 3D model maybe I would try that
05:27 - out okay so let me just make sure uh
05:31 - yeah so basically I mean I have to do a
05:33 - bit of work on my game so I figured I
05:35 - would play the game a little bit just in
05:37 - case some of you haven't seen gameplay
05:39 - of the game so going to play for a
05:41 - little bit and then basically going to
05:44 - try to do some work on it because I
05:45 - still got quite a be quite a few things
05:47 - that I need to do I look like Jah do I I
05:51 - guess I would need a bit more white hair
05:53 - all right but yeah thanks uh okay so I
05:56 - think everything set up so let me just
05:58 - yeah
06:01 - and on the characters I have no idea if
06:03 - the characters are going to to work does
06:05 - the game have co-op yep it does have
06:07 - co-op just online co-op for now but yeah
06:09 - I'm I'm planning to add local co-op in
06:12 - some future update so yeah that should
06:15 - be fun uh okay so take out the
06:19 - background and yeah
06:23 - so going to launch the game but I got to
06:27 - it's going to be quite a bit
06:30 - uh let me try to
06:33 - see yeah because the uh multiple
06:36 - monitors makes it a little bit
06:38 - tricky but I think everything should
06:41 - work and we'll see if
06:44 - the okay let me just make this window
06:47 - switch it over here okay so that should
06:50 - be and everything should be working now
06:54 - all right so yeah it's the the
06:56 - characters I'm not sure I can play the
06:57 - game with the characters on screen but
06:59 - see let me just make them just a little
07:01 - bit smaller just make it a bit fun so
07:03 - let's see if if like this if this is
07:06 - doable okay how did you get this chat
07:10 - system to work well if you want that I
07:11 - actually got a whole bunch of tutorials
07:13 - at the end of this page so basically
07:15 - this is a transparent window and on top
07:17 - of it the characters got some Mash based
07:19 - animation and then I'm really just
07:21 - interacting with YouTube API through an
07:23 - HTP request and then over here I covered
07:25 - how I make these dynamically generated
07:27 - characters so if you want there you go
07:29 - there's that tutorial and by the way
07:31 - just in case you want some nice free
07:33 - assets there's one right now on the
07:35 - asset store this asset pack is really
07:38 - awesome I've used this one in a bunch of
07:39 - my in a bunch of my videos and if you
07:41 - want it you can get it for free just use
07:43 - this coupon and apparently you can get
07:45 - it so this pack is really nice it's got
07:47 - quite a lot of things so I was quite
07:48 - impressed to see this one being
07:50 - completely free so anyways yeah just go
07:52 - ahead and get that one nice free asset
07:55 - and okay so let's play the game going to
07:58 - start off a brand new oh right it's the
08:00 - uh I wasn't thinking about
08:02 - the the uh sound effect is it working
08:06 - okay it is working just want to make
08:07 - sure that it's not way too
08:10 - loud yeah and it's probably doubling up
08:12 - so I got to erase my own sound just make
08:15 - sure that it doesn't cause
08:17 - Echo there be a recording of the stream
08:20 - yep I will make a VOD of this okay so
08:24 - let me just look at that just make sure
08:25 - that the sound effects and the music is
08:28 - not too loud just to make sure that it's
08:30 - okay I think I think it's pretty good if
08:32 - it isn't you let me know all right so
08:35 - let's go with a new game starting off on
08:37 - the Character
08:38 - Creator and let's do randomize a
08:41 - character so this is actually something
08:43 - that like I said I'm planning to do a
08:45 - tutorial on something like this how to
08:47 - make a nice character creator system
08:51 - it's actually surprisingly easy I mean
08:52 - it all depends on which asset you have
08:55 - but there are plenty of assets look at
08:56 - that that's a nice mask that's pretty
08:58 - fun let me change the backpack to
09:02 - something there you go some golf glubs
09:04 - that looks good okay the mask is nice
09:07 - but I think that's a bit too
09:09 - intense okay let's go like this I no
09:12 - something yeah something more like this
09:15 - for the colar I always like the yellow
09:16 - character that is pretty nice and for
09:19 - the
09:20 - shirt put something like this a nice
09:23 - little jacket and for the
09:25 - pants let's
09:27 - go uh uh something a bit
09:31 - more isn't there something in blue that
09:34 - would be nice okay or gray yep that
09:37 - works and for the shoes for something
09:41 - like this and for the mustache something
09:44 - like this okay so that's a real nice
09:46 - character there you go pretty cool like
09:49 - this all right that's pretty good so
09:51 - let's save the character and start off
09:53 - the
09:54 - game so starting off with this really
09:56 - nice
09:57 - level by the way note the the sound as
10:00 - the character is
10:02 - talking a fun thing about that about
10:04 - that little toning sound that is
10:06 - actually something that I made all the
10:08 - way back when I made my very first theme
10:09 - game Survivor Squad back then I want to
10:11 - have a really nice uh talking effect
10:14 - basically the inspiration was from GTA
10:16 - like the original GTA game where when
10:18 - the character spoke it spoke with uh
10:22 - that little tonking sound which sounds
10:24 - very strange so yeah it's really fun how
10:26 - I made that sound effect all the way
10:28 - back when I made my First Tee game which
10:30 - was 10 years ago I made that one and now
10:32 - I'm still reusing it on the game
10:34 - nowadays so yeah that's uh it's pretty
10:37 - fun okay yeah so basically the
10:40 - characters are down there but I can
10:41 - barely thanks so it sounds like Animal
10:44 - Crossing yeah yeah Animal Crossing does
10:46 - have some like that so that's pretty
10:49 - nice notic you don't get any income from
10:51 - the last C Humble Bundle isn't
10:54 - there I think it had the did I forget to
10:58 - add the a feel it I don't know but uh
11:01 - was it hard to make the tutal system uh
11:03 - not really that is something that is
11:05 - actually relatively simple and also
11:07 - something that I want to cover in a
11:08 - tutorial video basically Tut uh uh
11:11 - basically making a tutorial system like
11:12 - this one this is really just a saate
11:14 - machine that's really what it is so
11:15 - basically right now I've got this nice
11:17 - little visual just Dynamic just pointing
11:19 - to where I need to go and basically I've
11:20 - got a state machine on a simple enum I
11:23 - can probably show it I can just go into
11:26 - the it's in my spaceship level I don't
11:28 - know why this window is here but on my
11:31 - spaceship level manager there you go
11:33 - I've got the various stages so for
11:35 - example on that one right now I passed
11:37 - the intro message and I went into the
11:38 - Huard door open and over here I can see
11:41 - the actual State logic so I can see that
11:44 - when going into this one uh this is
11:46 - actually for the visuals on the client
11:48 - so it plays the music and updates the TV
11:50 - text so that's a text over over on there
11:53 - and just unlock some blockages so that
11:55 - the player can't go everywhere and then
11:57 - down here here is the actual logic so I
12:00 - basically find the object The Hanger
12:02 - gate which is this hanger gate right
12:03 - here I find and that one is triggered by
12:06 - the buttons so I find that one I find
12:09 - the hanger gate and basically when the
12:11 - hanger gate finds the unopened event
12:13 - when that happens and this one completes
12:14 - this tutal stage so basically making
12:16 - tutoral is really just putting together
12:19 - a ton of enums each of them with
12:21 - different Logic for completing the stage
12:22 - going on to the next one so that's
12:24 - pretty much how it goes it's super
12:25 - simple and over here the unopened event
12:27 - this is also super simple so basically I
12:30 - just have this button over here this
12:31 - button is connected to this gate and as
12:33 - soon as I try to interact so when the
12:35 - player tries to interact it goes it
12:37 - calls a server RPC because it's whole
12:38 - thing is uh multiplayer and single
12:40 - player and then just simply flips a
12:42 - bullion and when that bullion value
12:44 - changes when it changes it fires off
12:46 - this event and then over here the
12:48 - tutorial manager simply listens to it
12:50 - and completes the St so yeah in general
12:52 - making a tutorial is relatively simple
12:54 - and yep that is something that I want to
12:56 - cover in a future video because it
12:57 - should be should make for a pH
13:00 - tutorial
13:02 - okay is there a coupon code for the C
13:04 - for the free asset there's the uh uh
13:07 - which one my windows where's my there it
13:09 - is yeah just use the coupon cy23 and
13:12 - apparently you can get the Battle Royale
13:14 - pack for free so that's a pretty nice
13:16 - deal so definitely go ahead and get it
13:17 - that is super useful in many use Cas
13:19 - okay so let me play a little bit more
13:20 - and then I'll talk a little bit more so
13:22 - let's go open up the gate and go inside
13:24 - the hanger and there you go these are
13:26 - all the machines it's took quite a bit
13:29 - of manual work to build this entire
13:31 - scene set up all the logic all the
13:33 - things yeah it's quite complex really
13:34 - nice if we didn't have these machines it
13:37 - would take a ton of work to gather all
13:38 - these resource yeah that's a a little
13:40 - bit of foreshadowing I
13:41 - guess if something were to happen to
13:43 - this that would be quite annoying yes it
13:45 - would be yes it would be okay so now
13:47 - let's pick up some crates okay so pick
13:50 - it up and let's go and drop it here and
13:53 - here comes a nice cut scene and there
13:56 - you go oh no going through an asteroid
13:58 - field
14:00 - so there you go there's the spaceship
14:02 - boom and blows up and shields are down
14:06 - and there you go and we go into an alarm
14:08 - yeah I just want to make sure that the
14:09 - volume isn't way too loud now that the
14:11 - alarm is open so let me just go through
14:14 - this open up a few more Gates go in up a
14:17 - few more so I need to pick up some power
14:19 - to attitud generator so let me pick up
14:21 - the power approach the generator and
14:23 - just add power to the shield generator
14:26 - all right so that refreshes the Shields
14:27 - and apparently now we are set save so
14:29 - that's
14:29 - fun all right and now it broke the
14:32 - create container and something so before
14:34 - I do that let me just talk about a
14:36 - little bit what happened there just in
14:38 - case you don't know so let me go into
14:40 - the yeah over here on the game scene so
14:43 - if you want to know how I handle things
14:44 - first of all I've got multiple worlds
14:46 - for the various things so for example
14:48 - over here is the spaceship
14:50 - world and you can see y there you go
14:53 - this is the spaceship world so there are
14:55 - all the machines over there the defense
14:57 - area over here and the things in the end
14:59 - over there then there's a nice TV and so
15:01 - on and over there on the corner there
15:03 - you go that's where the cut scene
15:05 - happens so basically for the cut scene
15:07 - the camera is over here on the playable
15:09 - area it is showing here and as soon as
15:11 - it goes into the cut scene basically the
15:12 - camera shifts all the way up here so for
15:15 - the cutcenes where did I place did I
15:17 - place it on the logic component and that
15:20 - one is the spaceship asteroids so over
15:23 - here I've got a cinematic that is all
15:25 - just inside a simple prefab and inside
15:28 - the prefab I've got a virtual camera and
15:30 - cinematic has a simple just a simple
15:33 - animation so over here you can see let
15:35 - me just enable this and where's my
15:38 - where's my camera there you go there's
15:39 - the camera let me just enable the gizmos
15:42 - so y there you go so basically as soon
15:44 - as that it goes into that uh into that
15:47 - cut scene stage that stage for the to
15:49 - trigger the cut scene it simply enables
15:51 - this game object and starts playing off
15:52 - this animation so that is going to move
15:54 - a virtual camera moves it all the way
15:56 - over there then teleports the camera to
15:58 - the side as a bunch of explosions come
16:01 - in and attack the ship and then the ship
16:04 - blows up so that pretty much just
16:05 - enables a little particle effect
16:07 - something and then ends and then goes
16:09 - back into the regular gameplay camera so
16:12 - this is another thing that I very much
16:13 - want to cover in a tutorial because I
16:15 - think it's something that I don't think
16:16 - there are many tutorials on it basically
16:18 - how to make cut scenes which is actually
16:20 - something that is relatively simple I
16:22 - mean for the kind of cut scenes that I
16:23 - that I'm doing here they are actually
16:25 - quite basic so it's really just the
16:27 - camera teleports with certain position
16:29 - does a certain animation and then goes
16:31 - back into the regular gameplay camera
16:32 - mode so it's a it's a pretty fun thing
16:35 - so let me go back and nope no changes
16:40 - okay you didn't use timeline for cut
16:43 - scene nope I mean for these cut scenes
16:44 - these are all super basic the game is
16:47 - pretty basic in terms of story cut
16:48 - scenes and so on so nope I did not use
16:51 - timeline I just used super basic
16:53 - animations but yeah if you're making uh
16:56 - complex cut scenes then yeah I would
16:57 - definitely recommend you look into
16:59 - timeline because that one is made for
17:01 - handling really complex
17:05 - stuff all
17:10 - right seem like Cuts scenes are
17:12 - animations yep that's pretty much I mean
17:13 - there are many ways of doing cut scenes
17:15 - but yeah the way that I did it is
17:17 - essentially just animations all right so
17:19 - let's pick up a crate container and I'm
17:22 - supposed to build it over here just so
17:23 - that the tower can then get some ammo so
17:26 - let's place it down let's build the
17:27 - crate container coner and there you go
17:29 - so now I need to set the transport bot
17:31 - to drop ammo on that crate container so
17:33 - all the machines over here I've got a
17:35 - nice little setup here just mining some
17:38 - black crystals then it goes over here
17:40 - then the crafting machine is being
17:41 - interacted by this Autobot and it is
17:43 - spawning all kinds of ammo as you can
17:45 - see over here and then the item grab
17:47 - machine that one is just dropping ammo
17:48 - there and then there's a machine moving
17:50 - ammo over here and then there are
17:52 - various transport Bots moving the ammo
17:55 - to all the ones so I'm just set this one
17:57 - up and I'm going to pick up some ammo
17:59 - from this crate container and drop it on
18:01 - that crate container and there you go
18:03 - but now apparently there's another cut
18:05 - scene something bad is going to happen
18:08 - so there's a huge asteroid incoming and
18:11 - it blows up and the whole thing is about
18:12 - to blow up so lots of particle effects
18:14 - being being spawned all the way over
18:16 - there so yep there you go everything's
18:18 - about to blow up so let's get out of
18:20 - here before this whole thing breaks so
18:22 - got to get all the way back to the
18:24 - Escape
18:25 - pond so let's go all the way over there
18:28 - and interact to the Escape pod and Let's
18:30 - Escape the blowing up
18:33 - spaceship so that is the nice intro
18:35 - spaceship level that sort of guides the
18:38 - player through the basics and then
18:39 - starts the actual game proper so let's
18:42 - see
18:46 - this do you use abstract classes uh for
18:49 - a bunch of things
18:51 - yeah I can't remember what I use I'm
18:53 - pretty sure the base building class I'm
18:55 - pretty sure that one is abstract uh so
18:57 - anyways so the spaceship is gone but the
18:59 - plan is the same so let's begin by
19:00 - cloning a dinky so let's go and clone
19:03 - the very first dinky and there it is the
19:06 - first dinky and it's currently idle and
19:08 - of course the main goal about the the
19:11 - entire game is how the dinkies they're
19:12 - not they're not dumb they're very
19:14 - intelligent creatures which can actually
19:16 - help you so I can pick up dinky I can
19:18 - throw the dinky it's always fun to to
19:21 - throw dinkies and objects all right so
19:23 - let's give it an area and here is the
19:26 - really nice 3dy that I talked about in
19:28 - yesterday's video how it took me just a
19:30 - handful of hours to make this I really
19:31 - like how this came out this the way that
19:33 - the camera Zooms in so that is basically
19:35 - sin machine just calculates a camera
19:37 - position uh pointing back and down so
19:40 - just a really nice secondary camera
19:42 - position then of course it enables the
19:44 - the next volume controller which has a
19:46 - nice little depth of field effect so
19:48 - background is a little bit blurry and
19:50 - then over here the 3dy so this is a
19:52 - pretty simple uh World space canvas so
19:55 - this is something that actually I can
19:57 - instead of just stalky I can actually
19:59 - just show you so let me
20:01 - just I hope that this is not going to
20:03 - mess up my PC to run the game twice at
20:05 - the same time so let's hope my PC should
20:08 - be good enough to be able to
20:11 - uh to handle basically encoding a stream
20:14 - and doing this just so that I can show
20:16 - the inner workings behind how that works
20:18 - so for example over here inspecting a
20:20 - machine and I can pause and I can look
20:22 - and I can see over here is my Hier I've
20:24 - got my main I've got a regular canvas
20:26 - for all the 2D elements and I've got a
20:28 - 3D um canvas so this one is using a
20:32 - camera so I've got a render camera on
20:34 - thei so here it is it's a camera
20:37 - basically out into the world and then
20:39 - I've got the canvas which has just a
20:41 - slight rotation so inside I've got a
20:42 - container and over here just 15° on the
20:45 - Y just make it a little bit like that
20:47 - okay this doesn't update one it's like
20:49 - that but yep so basically just got a
20:51 - container and this one is slightly
20:52 - offset and then inside I've got all the
20:54 - various things like for example over
20:55 - here the crafting machine UI so as you
20:58 - can see pretty simple to make a 3dy and
21:01 - inside the game I do think this looks
21:03 - quite nice so I've got that 3dy for
21:05 - pretty much all the various
21:07 - things are these two virtual cameras or
21:10 - just one yeah I've got plenty of virtual
21:12 - cameras over here but uh for the
21:15 - basically I've got a main virtual camera
21:17 - so this is one that is above this is the
21:19 - regular gameplay camera and then for the
21:21 - second one actually don't remember where
21:24 - where this one is so that's the player
21:26 - virtual camera
21:28 - uh where's my inspect system my inspect
21:31 - object camera system and over here yep
21:33 - I've got my second virtual camera which
21:35 - is again can see this one places all the
21:38 - way down there it has a wider FV in
21:40 - order to see quite a bit more and then
21:42 - just has a look at so just look straight
21:44 - at the Player points a little bit back
21:46 - here like that so basically just this
21:48 - inspect object comes enabled whenever
21:50 - which in turn makes that camera disables
21:52 - when I cancel on down all
21:55 - right how you doing I'm doing great
21:57 - thanks thanks for for being here fix the
22:00 - interface bug when you point your cursor
22:02 - at the corner of UI button and starts
22:04 - blinking uh I think so I know that I
22:08 - fixed a bunch of those bugs where
22:10 - basically the issue is that uh the
22:11 - animation for the button basically first
22:14 - it squishes horizontally and then
22:16 - vertically so as I move over the button
22:18 - that little animation so that would
22:20 - cause where if you got into the corner
22:21 - yeah sometimes does this but yeah for a
22:23 - bunch of buttons like over here on this
22:25 - one yeah this one doesn't do that I
22:27 - added a little fix I had a little
22:28 - invisible image but yeah some of these
22:30 - if you go in the corner it still gets a
22:32 - bit odd it has to do with the animation
22:34 - squishing and then going like that so
22:38 - yeah so basically still just need to
22:40 - have that little fix for the rest of
22:42 - okay so let me do the tutorial a little
22:44 - bit more before I talk more okay so
22:47 - let's give it a gather resource nodes
22:49 - Behavior start gathering over here the
22:51 - green crystals and once again for here
22:54 - for selecting the area this is another
22:55 - virtual camera that is enabled while
22:57 - it's on this mode so I can move around
22:59 - select the area and there you go and
23:00 - let's start the order and there goes
23:02 - dinky now trying to gather some green
23:05 - resource nodes and I can get a few
23:06 - myself so I can do it manually but of
23:10 - course with this being an automation
23:11 - game doing it manually is quite a bit
23:14 - annoying so let's not do it manually
23:16 - let's get a second dinky and actually
23:19 - before that I guess the D wants me to
23:21 - make a a crate container building so
23:25 - let's do that actually the
23:29 - cuz the game doesn't have many elements
23:30 - down there so let me actually just
23:31 - increase cuz I can't really read that I
23:33 - always got to look on the side to be
23:35 - able to read chat all right so let's
23:38 - build another crate Contin building and
23:40 - start putting things there putting
23:41 - things in a
23:42 - crate and like that except like this
23:46 - once again doing it manually is really
23:48 - annoying so let us clone another free
23:50 - second
23:53 - dinky so let's pick it up and on this
23:55 - one I want to tell it to gather objects
23:57 - so let's let's go with a grab object
23:59 - which by the way all of these orders
24:00 - these are all different components so
24:03 - once again I can go over here I can look
24:05 - in my scripts folder uh where's my
24:08 - scripts folder there it is my scripts
24:10 - folder which as you can see you know
24:12 - being a complete steam game means that
24:15 - there are quite a lot of scripts and
24:16 - these are all just IR regular ones that
24:18 - I've got a bunch for the UI a bunch for
24:20 - tons of things and what I want to show
24:22 - is over here the dinky
24:24 - behaviors so for example I've got dink
24:26 - Behavior right here so for example a
24:27 - while ago someone was talking about do I
24:30 - use
24:32 - uh do I use abstract classes and yep
24:34 - over here the dink Behavior the base
24:36 - class this one is an abstract class
24:38 - because I never want to instantiate a
24:39 - dink Behavior so if you don't know what
24:41 - is an abstract class basically it means
24:43 - by adding this abstract uh tag thing uh
24:46 - it basically means that I cannot
24:48 - construct a brand new thinkinking
24:49 - Behavior so basically I can only
24:50 - construct things that are extending upon
24:52 - this so like for example the which one
24:55 - am I going to get like The Gather
24:56 - resource node dinky beh Behavior so
24:58 - there you go this one extends dinky
24:59 - behavior and as you can see over here
25:01 - it's got a whole bunch of logic for how
25:03 - this whole thing works so I've got a
25:06 - super basic saate machine to handle the
25:07 - behavior so for The Gather resource node
25:10 - this one is basically looking for
25:11 - resources then it moves to gather
25:13 - resources and then it actually gathers
25:15 - resources so as you can see it's
25:16 - actually super simple the uh AI
25:19 - implementation the way the whole thing
25:20 - works and only now I noticed that
25:22 - apparently why did
25:25 - my why did my camera get messed
25:28 - up okay was that messed up for a while
25:35 - now okay I'm trying to figure out I
25:39 - didn't even
25:40 - notice how did that get messed
25:44 - up oh cuz I probably oh I probably
25:47 - touched the yeah that's the that's kind
25:49 - of the
25:50 - issue yeah cuz this little camera tripod
25:53 - is not
25:54 - very it is not very stable so
25:58 - yeah I'll probably just touch the yeah
26:00 - just touch the table and the whole thing
26:02 - moved quite a bit okay anyways all right
26:05 - that was
26:06 - fun uh
26:09 - okay can I ask you something what free
26:11 - or paid assets you use in your game uh I
26:13 - use quite a handful that's another thing
26:16 - that I want to cover in a full video but
26:18 - yeah I used f for all the various
26:21 - animations then I use the text render uh
26:24 - if you saw the tutorial over there
26:25 - writing the text so I use that for
26:28 - quite a few things then I use quibbl for
26:30 - over here the outline for the uh Shader
26:33 - and I use an AET obviously I use asses
26:36 - for all the visual things so this little
26:37 - dinky this is actually supposedly it's
26:39 - supposed to be a bunny I just colored it
26:41 - pink and looks like a nice funny little
26:44 - creature then for the character itself
26:46 - also has so yeah I'm using quite a few
26:48 - things and I'm going to be making a
26:50 - video talking about all the s that I'm
26:52 - using okay so let me do a little bit
26:54 - more so grab objects so let me pick pick
26:57 - up a green
26:58 - Crystal and pick it up from this area
27:01 - and drop it on the crate container right
27:03 - over there and start the order and there
27:05 - you go and now that dinky is going to
27:06 - help me but dinkies also need to eat
27:09 - because of course they do so let me also
27:12 - pick
27:12 - up some food so pick up some food and I
27:16 - need to feed dinky and once again I can
27:18 - throw food that actually doesn't help
27:21 - very much although someone mentioned uh
27:23 - one little nice piece of feedback is
27:25 - someone someone was trying to feed
27:27 - dinkies by essentially throwing food on
27:28 - top of them and that is not intentional
27:30 - but I think that would be a fun mechanic
27:32 - so that is something that I have on my
27:34 - to list because I think it would be fun
27:35 - to just throw and have the dinky
27:37 - automatically jump pick up the food and
27:39 - eat it I think that could be fun but
27:41 - anyways for now let's do it manually so
27:44 - let's feed it just like that and yep of
27:46 - course being an automation game means
27:47 - later on we can automate
27:49 - feeding okay so now we need the research
27:51 - lab and for that we are going to need
27:53 - some Stone so let me try to pick up so
27:56 - we've got 10 green crystals so I can out
27:59 - craft my nice little things so let's
28:02 - place it over here I always build the
28:03 - exact same layout I mean I play the game
28:05 - I don't even know how many times but
28:07 - yeah I always end up building the exact
28:09 - same layout so put green crystals in
28:11 - there then someone over here and so on
28:13 - so
28:14 - yeah cool to catch you live oh thanks
28:17 - thanks for being here yeah I'm glad the
28:19 - videos have helped nice I literally just
28:21 - thought about factory factory is awesome
28:23 - uh I definitely want to play it quite a
28:25 - bit more I played it all the way back
28:27 - before it was even on Steam and it was
28:29 - one of those games that really caught me
28:31 - so I spent it I played it for like 50
28:34 - hours in like 2 days that was okay I
28:36 - don't think that's possible but yeah
28:38 - like 50 hours in like three or four days
28:40 - it was crazy that game is really so
28:42 - awesome so I definitely if you like
28:43 - automation games obviously I recommend
28:45 - Factor really awesome okay so let's
28:47 - change the crafting recipe I want to
28:49 - craft a nice research lab and also
28:52 - someone else a while ago was talking
28:53 - about assets and uh yep I've used lots
28:56 - of assets but I've also used lots of
28:57 - things that I've made previously in the
28:58 - game like for example over here this
29:00 - little thumbnail and there you go that
29:02 - thing is hungry so I got to fix that but
29:04 - yeah so basically this little did I say
29:07 - thumbnail I mean tool tip uh yeah
29:10 - basically this tool tip another thing
29:11 - that I'm going to cover when I make that
29:14 - that video on the what assets I'm using
29:17 - part of the assets that I'm using are
29:18 - really just things that I've built
29:19 - previously so for example that tool tip
29:21 - that I'm using over there is this one
29:22 - over here that I made in a text tutorial
29:25 - quite a long time ago so yeah using code
29:27 - is something that I always talk about
29:29 - and that is definitely something that
29:30 - I've used quite a lot in the making of
29:31 - this game so yeah okay so let's craft
29:35 - it you are so inspiring well that's
29:38 - that's awesome I mean I'm glad that I
29:40 - inspire you to work on your gamees un
29:41 - like that one if you use UI elements or
29:44 - just the canvas systm I've I have not
29:46 - used UI I've done some research on it to
29:49 - figure out how it works but as far as I
29:50 - know UI elements I don't think it's yet
29:53 - uh set up for uh runtime use so yeah for
29:57 - this game this is just using just
29:58 - regular Unity UI okay so let me just
30:01 - feed these dinkies cuz these poor things
30:03 - they're all starving so let me try to do
30:08 - that here's my now created tool tip
30:11 - about the buttons to gra throw uh that's
30:13 - the exact same code that I use for the
30:15 - tool tip for the thing so as you can see
30:17 - it's just the size is dynamic based on
30:19 - the text underlying it but yeah it's
30:22 - literally the exact same code that I use
30:23 - for the regular tool tips so if I go
30:25 - over here and I go inside the recipe so
30:28 - here I've got a regular tool tip so the
30:29 - one that I'm using in the game is the
30:31 - exact same thing the only difference is
30:33 - really that it's a in World UI so let me
30:36 - go over here let me close this and there
30:39 - you go just like this let me pause let
30:41 - me look at the game and there you go
30:43 - this is the world
30:45 - UI so as you can see over here I've got
30:47 - the player character inside the player
30:49 - has a interact action World UI so this
30:52 - is a standard the canvas so this is a
30:54 - regular World space UI element and Y
30:57 - then inside I've got the interact
30:58 - alternate the interact and so on so I've
31:01 - got all those things and yeah the code
31:03 - for making the background match the
31:05 - underlying text that is the exact same
31:07 - code that I have on the same on the same
31:10 - toll tip okay all right so uh what was I
31:14 - doing right I need to research the
31:16 - crafting machine so let's go inside the
31:18 - tech tree and research the crafting
31:20 - machine so I need some experienced
31:22 - pellets so let's pick it up and they
31:24 - also need quite a bit of food so let me
31:26 - feed them
31:28 - will you add modding into the game like
31:29 - Tut you made yep I definitely do want to
31:32 - add modding I still don't know exactly
31:34 - what I'm going to select as modable
31:36 - things but yep that is definitely
31:38 - something that I want to do not sure
31:40 - when so maybe next month I don't know I
31:42 - still got to find time cuz that's a
31:44 - relatively tricky task but yep when I do
31:46 - I will be watching my own tutorial to
31:48 - figure out can you say my name please
31:51 - Sun Bean okay that's a nice name all
31:54 - right um our viewers care on the bottom
31:57 - also made in unity yep
32:03 - I I got a bunch of tutorials down here
32:06 - if you want to know how I made it so at
32:08 - the bottom of this
32:10 - page so basically this is a transparent
32:12 - Unity window all these characters over
32:14 - here then for the animations these are
32:15 - mesh based animations then for
32:17 - interacting with YouTube API that is
32:19 - just a simple HTTP request and then the
32:22 - Sprite sheets these are the same that I
32:23 - use in my game battle round Tycoon so
32:25 - that's pretty much how the whole thing
32:27 - works okay so I need to research a
32:30 - crafting machine I've got enough XP so
32:32 - let me just add some progress and do
32:34 - some
32:40 - research how did you create the sounds
32:42 - music oh for the sounds they came from a
32:44 - sound pack and for the music I hired a
32:47 - musician on Fiverr so that was pretty
32:49 - fun I'm really happy with the music and
32:50 - look at that research complete the ni
32:52 - little UI element and now here comes the
32:55 - zombies so this this is the defense part
32:58 - of the game I definitely don't want them
33:00 - to eat the dinkies so let me try to
33:03 - punch him do a nice little underground
33:06 - slam like that and boom there you go all
33:09 - the zombies all right defense success
33:11 - okay good so they are safe make sure to
33:15 - always keep them safe so obviously once
33:16 - again the whole game is about automation
33:18 - so the goal is to eventually automate
33:20 - them and here's the nice bonus that
33:22 - little Chief character gave me so as
33:25 - always let me pick up so let me put a
33:27 - mining machine to automatically start
33:29 - mining some things and then I'm going to
33:31 - need a atam grabber to pick up the food
33:35 - let me do basically the same setup that
33:36 - I do
33:38 - always so let me craft this
33:42 - one how did you decide on automation for
33:45 - this game how much do you lean on Market
33:47 - Research uh I don't know that's a bit of
33:49 - a tricky question because on the one
33:51 - hand I do a bit of Market Research in
33:53 - the sense that I'm always studying uh
33:56 - what is happening on steam what are the
33:57 - various things that are popular and so
33:59 - on so I'm constantly always searching
34:01 - for that but at the same time I didn't
34:03 - necessarily pick an automation game
34:05 - because it's uh popular or anything I
34:07 - picked it because one of the games that
34:09 - I like to make that I like to make that
34:11 - I like to play and I had never made an
34:12 - automation game so yep for this one it
34:14 - was perfect although I have to say that
34:17 - given how I made this game in just 6
34:19 - months if I could go back in time I
34:21 - definitely would say do not try making a
34:23 - automation game in just 6 months because
34:27 - yeah these are quite complex games and
34:29 - yeah the last six months were definitely
34:30 - quite stressful because Yep this is
34:32 - quite a complex game quite a lot of
34:34 - lines of kill a lot of things there you
34:35 - go now we've got some automation for
34:38 - feeding all the dinkies okay so that's
34:39 - pretty
34:42 - fun can we skip the tutorial I I have
34:45 - that on my to-do list but uh no I
34:47 - haven't done yet but yeah that is
34:50 - something that several people have
34:52 - mentioned so
34:54 - yep is that enough of the option to have
34:56 - the camera more zoomed out uh not really
34:59 - that's one of those things that I'm not
35:00 - sure if it would be a good addition
35:02 - because the game is really made for one
35:04 - particular camera view
35:07 - so yeah I don't know I guess I could add
35:09 - it cuz I guess it wouldn't be much of a
35:10 - negative but yeah the uh it was very
35:12 - much designed with this top down view in
35:18 - mind oh boy I got to see my voice
35:20 - already messed up cuz I haven't I
35:22 - haven't done a live stream in about I
35:24 - don't know 6 months so yeah quite a bit
35:28 - yeah I don't think I'll be able to go
35:29 - too long right now before my voice goes
35:31 - out anyway so let me try to do a few
35:34 - more things aser your inspiration for
35:38 - this game uh I played it quite a while
35:40 - ago definitely one of my favorite games
35:41 - so I guess subconsciously it was an
35:44 - inspiration but not directly but yeah
35:46 - subconsciously definitely it is an
35:48 - excellent game so let me okay let me try
35:50 - researching some more things so I need
35:52 - to build my crafting machine and for
35:54 - that I'm going to need so let me get
35:55 - this one go and gather some Stone
35:58 - resource nodes let me start doing that
36:01 - and then I have another dinky there you
36:02 - go you go and grab objects let me pick
36:05 - up some
36:06 - Stone some Stone from there and drop it
36:09 - over on this
36:11 - one okay
36:13 - nice H in Factoria you could copy the
36:16 - setting of the assembling machine yep
36:18 - want to copy this yeah I think that's
36:21 - one of those things that in theory it
36:23 - sounds useful but in reality building a
36:26 - good UI for that is really tricky
36:28 - basically one thing that I want I
36:30 - definitely want this game to be much
36:31 - more of a casual automation I definitely
36:34 - don't want it to be super hardcore like
36:35 - factorio so basically any feature that
36:38 - requires adding tons of complex UI
36:40 - elements that is always something that
36:42 - I'm a bit reluctant to add so yeah I can
36:45 - see the point I can see the potential
36:47 - benefit but trying to balance that
36:49 - benefit with trying to make it not
36:51 - insanely complex yeah that is that's a
36:53 - very tricky
36:55 - question
36:57 - do you already see what systems made
36:59 - apparently for this game we use for
37:01 - total World Liberation uh I'm not sure I
37:04 - mean cuz that game is quite different
37:06 - it's got well the main difference is how
37:08 - it's all very grid based so yeah I don't
37:10 - know I mean for that in terms of uh
37:13 - balancing things between I mean things
37:16 - like the tun tip so I'm definitely going
37:18 - to reuse that code in that game so but
37:21 - in general just the basic knowledge the
37:23 - knowledge that I gain from doing all
37:24 - kinds of let me just move this one a
37:25 - little bit make it a bit closer just to
37:27 - be able to catch the own as well but
37:30 - yeah in general any games that you make
37:31 - you always learn quite a lot even if the
37:35 - genre isn't the exact same and so on so
37:37 - let just research yeah I need to get it
37:39 - thank you for research and it's almost
37:42 - nighttime so I'm going to have to defend
37:44 - manually so let's
37:49 - see what is your next plan for the next
37:52 - game to be released uh I don't know I
37:54 - have not thought that far yet right now
37:56 - now there are still quite a lot of
37:57 - things that I want
37:59 - to that I want to add and improve onto
38:01 - this game so right now I'm trying to
38:04 - just add a few more things and then okay
38:08 - let me just take out all the zombies
38:09 - there you go the fence nice and easy
38:11 - wave so yeah basally there are still
38:12 - quite a lot of things that I want to add
38:14 - to this one before I think about what's
38:17 - next B my problem is always I have way
38:20 - too many things that I want to do all
38:21 - the time and that is always my issue
38:23 - okay let me try Gathering some more
38:25 - machines and I'm going to need another
38:27 - dinky can I get it no need more houses
38:30 - cuz I really want so which one of you is
38:32 - picking up you are grabbing objects so
38:35 - you interact you do some research cuz I
38:39 - really don't want to do manual research
38:41 - myself okay so I think I'm going to need
38:44 - some greeni to make that let's do that
38:48 - first time I catch you live huh thanks
38:49 - for being here yeah I definitely would
38:51 - like to do a bit more regular live
38:54 - streams what to learn programming p
38:56 - patterns from you actually I would like
38:58 - to make some some videos potentially a
39:00 - course just specifically on programming
39:03 - patterns design patterns I think that
39:04 - would be quite fun I think that would be
39:07 - quite an interesting topic so yep that
39:09 - is definitely something that I would
39:10 - love to do in the future okay so for the
39:13 - mining machine I'm going to need some
39:15 - green and let me just also research the
39:18 - Grabber machine let me do this and start
39:22 - crafting some greeni and I'm also going
39:24 - to need uh crate container so let me
39:27 - just craft the crate container just to
39:29 - put all
39:34 - myenum uh no nothing okay sure yeah get
39:38 - another
39:38 - one just a create container put another
39:41 - one there all
39:43 - right use any design patterns in this
39:45 - game sure yeah quite a lot of things
39:47 - quite a lot of a handful of inheritance
39:50 - quite a lot of interfaces so
39:54 - yeah uh oh boy boy my voice is already
39:57 - messed up I really can't talk too
40:03 - much okay do you use D tween for your UI
40:06 - animations uh no that's actually that's
40:09 - a really awesome M that I've heard
40:11 - really great things about but no I'm not
40:13 - using for the for example this little
40:15 - slide up animation for that I'm just
40:17 - using uh just using F which is
40:20 - actually one of the great assets that
40:23 - I'm using here so let's see one of the
40:24 - UI so for example
40:26 - let's go
40:30 - inside let me see one of these UI these
40:33 - actually don't have buttons so I got to
40:35 - find I got to find the UI with some
40:36 - buttons let me go back show the menu and
40:40 - yep the menu which has this little jump
40:43 - up doing this is super easy using
40:46 - something like feel so for example over
40:48 - here on the game menu for the resume
40:50 - button I've got inside the button as
40:53 - child I've got a feel for the mouse over
40:54 - Mouse click and mouse out so it's got a
40:56 - real nice question and stretch then it
40:59 - enables an image scales and so on so
41:02 - yeah basically if you want to polish
41:04 - things I can highly recommend the acid
41:06 - feel oh boy my voice is already messed
41:08 - up
41:10 - um let me
41:12 - just I did make a full asset review on
41:15 - it so if you don't know what I'm talking
41:17 - about that is a really awesome asset so
41:19 - I definitely if you want to polish your
41:22 - games I definitely encourage looking
41:24 - into that one all right
41:28 - to job system did I use the job system
41:30 - to make the game and nope not really I
41:32 - mean I always thought about I always
41:34 - kept it in the back of my head the job
41:35 - system and dots but in reality the game
41:39 - is still prep performant so just writing
41:41 - regular code that I've write that I've
41:43 - been written ah that I've been writing
41:46 - uh just that has been quite performant
41:48 - so nope I didn't actually need that is
41:50 - also something that I that I always keep
41:53 - in mind just in case I have performance
41:54 - issues but nope so far the game even on
41:56 - pre- enlarg colonies it is still quite
41:59 - quite performant so oh hey K's in chat
42:02 - hey Cal how's it going nice that's cool
42:06 - um uh anyways what was I saying I don't
42:09 - know but yeah in terms of performance
42:11 - didn't actually use dots but yep perhaps
42:13 - in the future as I continue building
42:16 - upon the game okay what was I doing so I
42:18 - need a mining machine so let me go make
42:21 - a nice mining machine and I'm going to
42:23 - need to get some power so let me start
42:27 - researching the power generator so first
42:29 - get the black
42:31 - crystals so mining machine put one over
42:34 - there and get this one instead of mining
42:36 - you grab objects let me grab the stone
42:41 - and pick it up and just put it uh in
42:45 - that one okay great and zomie attacking
42:47 - okay so I got
42:48 - to got to do that yeah I got to theend
42:52 - from the zombies it's it's quite tricky
42:55 - trying to play and tonk at the same
42:57 - time it really makes me admire uh
43:01 - content creators live streams oh boy I
43:04 - can't even talk who do this uh every
43:07 - single day cuz yeah it really does
43:10 - not really does not work for me you
43:13 - should do a plushy of the dinkies yeah
43:14 - that would be fun that would be a fun
43:17 - interesting idea okay let me make some
43:19 - mins just so I don't continuously get
43:21 - attacked let me do
43:24 - that soon be scill with time yep they
43:26 - scale with the heat over here on the top
43:28 - right corner there's a little threat
43:30 - indicator so that basically increases
43:32 - every time that I build either new
43:34 - machines or spawn new dinkies so yep as
43:37 - you grow your Colony the zomie waves
43:39 - become more and more intense okay so
43:41 - those are our power even though I don't
43:43 - really need more food so yeah wow this
43:46 - dinky is really researching fast like
43:48 - crazy way too fast for me to keep up all
43:50 - right let me make a few more machines so
43:53 - a mining machine I'm going to need or
43:55 - let me actually make make a grabber
43:58 - machine let me put it all the way up
44:00 - here just to be able to craft
44:02 - things je AAR or navigation for the
44:05 - zombies and nope actually over here the
44:07 - game does not have any path finding
44:09 - whatsoever that is one of those things
44:11 - that I thought about I tried
44:13 - implementing it but I realized same
44:15 - thing with the collisions like obviously
44:17 - it makes no sense that the character is
44:19 - going through all the collisions all the
44:21 - things that makes no sense but I tried
44:22 - it and really just became really
44:24 - frustrating having to always go and
44:26 - zigzag and move all over that just
44:28 - became just became more frustrating than
44:30 - than fun so yeah in the end I decided to
44:32 - opt for no collisions nothing like that
44:35 - so in terms of movement they just move
44:36 - straight from A to B no no problems like
44:39 - that so yeah that is one of those that
44:41 - is just a oh boy what did I okay uh that
44:44 - is really just a design choice that I
44:47 - tried various things and yep just
44:48 - removing collisions was the best way the
44:52 - the thing that made the game more
44:54 - fun okay so me try and set this up and
44:58 - that thinging no longer needs that so
45:01 - theart and yeah yeah I guess you can go
45:03 - and research the rocket right away and
45:07 - what am I going to need so I'm going to
45:08 - need the power generator and for that
45:10 - I'm going to need some like crystals so
45:12 - let me manually get a whole bunch of
45:14 - them even though obviously I don't want
45:15 - to do this manually
45:17 - so oh boy my voice already so messed
45:20 - up yeah I think I can only do this for
45:22 - like 20 minutes more before I cannot
45:25 - talk
45:33 - anymore oh Super Chat super sticker A1
45:37 - oh nice thank you so much that's cool
45:40 - and yeah live stream also has I haven't
45:43 - done a live stream in about in about uh
45:47 - I don't know like 6 months or something
45:49 - so yeah now YouTube has those little
45:53 - Arts I don't even know what that is but
45:55 - apparently I can now heart Super Chat so
45:57 - I guess that's fun and I can post random
46:01 - emojis that show up on the side yeah
46:04 - definitely I mean I guess it's nice to
46:06 - see uh YouTube adding more and more
46:08 - features to their live stream thing but
46:10 - yeah it's a it's an interesting
46:13 - thing uh yeah if you don't stream
46:16 - regularly then it is stupidly exhausting
46:18 - yeah I can definitely confirm that every
46:21 - time I try making a try making a stream
46:24 - it is always so difficult don't I really
46:26 - have no idea how people do this
46:28 - regularly because yeah I just just doing
46:31 - it for 1 hour feels so exhausting so
46:34 - insane I mean it is fun but it's also
46:36 - very very demanding so yeah it's uh
46:39 - quite tricky so let me try to pick this
46:41 - up and try drop some things and now I'm
46:43 - going to need one Binky to gather some
46:46 - power so let me I also need a grab
46:48 - machine to try to automate my power
46:50 - Gathering so let me go over here and
46:53 - zombies I got to prepare things so you
46:56 - pick up some power and drop it all the
46:58 - way over there and now I think this
47:01 - dinky is Idle or rather it's not doing
47:04 - anything so you go and no not gather you
47:07 - go and interact let's do some power okay
47:12 - so you start Gathering some power that
47:13 - one is going to pick up power and now I
47:15 - just need one more dinky I don't have
47:18 - anymore so let me
47:19 - actually try to get a brand new
47:23 - house what models are you using are they
47:26 - customizable uh yep the character I mean
47:28 - the character creation
47:32 - screen oh boy the character creation yep
47:36 - I'm using a really nice asset that has
47:38 - tons of pieces so that is why I
47:40 - implemented the little thing yeah thanks
47:43 - so much for the Super
47:45 - Chat okay and Zoomies are attacking so
47:47 - let me actually oh boy I need ah yeah
47:51 - cuz I'm cuz I'm playing quite a bit
47:52 - slower since I'm trying to play and talk
47:55 - at the at the same time let me get just
47:57 - a few mines just to help me come on make
48:01 - a mine let me throw a mine there mine
48:04 - there and I don't think there are going
48:05 - to be enough so yeah you just take down
48:08 - so let me just get the rest okay
48:11 - good all right so what do I need I need
48:14 - to make that house and in order to make
48:16 - the house I think I'm going to need five
48:18 - renum so let me actually get a a little
48:20 - bit of
48:21 - renum don't over workk your voice yeah I
48:25 - try not to but at the same
48:27 - time I always it's always a problem that
48:30 - I want to do way too much to the point
48:31 - where it becomes a bit unhealthy so yeah
48:33 - I would love to do live streams for tens
48:35 - of hours because it's it's fun but yeah
48:37 - physically speaking my my voice
48:39 - definitely does not work I definitely
48:42 - cannot handle that so yeah uh okay so I
48:44 - just need one more dinky to start
48:46 - automating the power and then everything
48:48 - should be pretty fun so let just get one
48:50 - more dinky like
48:53 - that you know how I find your stream
48:55 - nope I don't know I have no idea how
48:57 - discoverability works on the on YouTube
49:00 - so yeah I have no idea how every time I
49:03 - make a live stream tons of people join
49:05 - so I have no idea how YouTube does that
49:08 - so yeah you receive interesting bug
49:11 - reports after releasing the game yep
49:13 - lots and lots of very strange bug
49:14 - reports I mean the fact that this is an
49:16 - automation game means that it has quite
49:18 - a bit of complexity so where's my didn't
49:22 - I set up a dinky oh he went all the way
49:24 - over there so yeah dinkies are a little
49:25 - bit slow so go on grab power Yeah so
49:28 - basically there were quite a lot of very
49:30 - strange bugs that happened in very
49:32 - specific circumstances that I've never
49:34 - encountered myself whilst actually
49:36 - working on the game so yeah that was
49:38 - definitely quite uh
49:41 - interesting will you be live streaming a
49:44 - game making in the future yeah I mean
49:46 - the goal with this live stream was
49:47 - simultaneously to play the game and then
49:48 - work a little bit on it but considering
49:52 - how my voice is messed up I don't think
49:53 - I'll be able to go for quite a while so
49:55 - I guess guess on this one I will only be
49:56 - doing just playing the game for a little
49:58 - bit and then I don't know maybe tomorrow
50:01 - or whenever my voice recovers i w do a
50:04 - little bit more and more focus on
50:06 - actually coding but yeah for now the
50:09 - plan was doing playing and coding but I
50:11 - think think I'm just going to play a
50:13 - little bit
50:15 - okay uh all right so let me automate a
50:17 - bunch more things so I probably want to
50:19 - automate that thing on the left side so
50:22 - for the mining machine I'm going to need
50:23 - a whole bunch of renum so let me make a
50:26 - whole bunch more
50:28 - prenium and yeah I probably could use
50:31 - another dinky to help me automate the
50:33 - crafting so where's my where's the dinky
50:37 - there you go come here and you go and
50:39 - help me automate the crafting over there
50:43 - so craft a whole bunch of greeni so I
50:46 - think I'm going to need
50:48 - 10 do you know other programming
50:50 - languages except C Shar yep I've I mean
50:53 - I've uh I've t T quite a lot of
50:56 - languages but yeah definitely in terms
50:58 - of actual proper skill uh I would say
51:01 - definitely C is the one what I would say
51:04 - I'm properly skilled but yeah I've
51:06 - definitely I've done some JavaScript
51:09 - some Java some HTML oh God don't craft
51:12 - too many just want uh yeah so Java
51:16 - JavaScript HTML I've done action script
51:19 - 2.0 and
51:20 - 3.0 back in college I did a little bit
51:23 - of C I also learned a little bit of a
51:25 - assembly uh what else I mean in high
51:28 - school I learned a little bit about
51:30 - Pascal uh and for web design I also
51:33 - learned quite a bit of
51:35 - PHP so yeah that's pretty much it so
51:37 - I've touched I don't know like 10
51:39 - different languages so yeah basically
51:41 - once you know the first language that
51:43 - really is the trickiest one after you
51:45 - know the first one learning other
51:46 - languages learning the basics of it it's
51:49 - actually quite simple okay so that one's
51:52 - already automating so now let me just
51:54 - make a grab a machine but just make one
51:58 - so let you go there you go
52:07 - back White characters have dark shadows
52:09 - around them H that's just a stylistic
52:12 - choice it's just uh uh what do you call
52:14 - it ambient inclusion that's really all
52:17 - it is just something pretty basic which
52:20 - I always find that it looks quite good
52:22 - so just a little bit of ambient
52:23 - occlusion to add a little bit of Shadows
52:25 - and everything looks quite oh yeah I
52:27 - still got my bonus power over here I
52:29 - guess I can well already got way too
52:31 - much power so anyways um
52:35 - yep you try to make a game without using
52:38 - a game engine uh when I was a kid I
52:40 - tried something
52:41 - called Dark basic I think that was the
52:44 - name which was well I guess that one was
52:46 - technically kind of an engine but yeah
52:48 - in terms of working directly with with
52:51 - the open gel or direct X nope I've never
52:53 - actually done that that is actually
52:55 - something that I would love to try out
52:57 - just just for some fun research let me
53:00 - get a few
53:02 - mines just a few mines I can only get
53:05 - one or two so just two mines and then
53:08 - I've got to manually oh boy there are
53:10 - way too many so yeah I definitely do
53:12 - need to set up some proper defenses
53:15 - otherwise I'm not going to be able to
53:17 - get the rest so let me just prepare a
53:19 - few mines that is actually something
53:20 - that I have on my te list is when the
53:23 - defense become a bit more intense have
53:25 - the little a little bonus giving you a
53:28 - few more mines I think that would be a
53:31 - fun so anyway so for mines I need black
53:33 - crystals so for black crystals I'm going
53:34 - to need you instead of doing that come
53:37 - here and just gather some black
53:40 - crystals all right so you do just that
53:44 - then there's another one you instead of
53:46 - doing
53:47 - that just no not together uh you grab
53:52 - objects and let me
53:54 - grab crystals in this area and put it on
53:57 - that great
53:59 - container all right so yeah and you do a
54:02 - few mins you sure like that all right do
54:05 - you use visual
54:07 - script do you see the use of visual
54:10 - script in the future of game I mean
54:11 - personally I don't really I love writing
54:14 - code so for me I don't really use visual
54:16 - scripting much but yep it's it's a tool
54:18 - and like with any tool some people can
54:21 - can really use it quite a lot and other
54:22 - people don't see the value but yeah if
54:24 - you like it I definitely encourage you
54:26 - to try it out cuz there are quite a few
54:28 - nice use cases
54:33 - yeah use default transport class for net
54:35 - code yep and how you create lobbies and
54:39 - so on I mean if you want to know the
54:40 - basics behind the networking for the
54:42 - game then you can really just watch my
54:45 - my complete multiplayer course because I
54:48 - mean the core of this game really works
54:50 - the exact same way as what I covered in
54:52 - that course so I'm using Lobby relay and
54:55 - and so on so yep the core of it is
54:57 - really quite
55:00 - similar well that I got a few mines okay
55:02 - that is way too many mines so let's go
55:04 - back into
55:05 - greeni and pick up all the mines just
55:08 - throw them all the way over
55:10 - there okay that should be enough to
55:13 - survive at least the next wave okay so I
55:15 - need another crate
55:17 - container let me make a crate container
55:20 - like
55:24 - that how do you store and save data
55:26 - while
55:28 - runtime not sure what you mean by store
55:31 - and save data you mean between scenes uh
55:35 - for that one usually you can just use
55:37 - basic static
55:38 - Fields but yeah I'm usual I'm using
55:42 - the same save logic that I've used in
55:46 - quite a lot so if you want to know how I
55:48 - do saving I made a tutorial I should
55:50 - probably make an updated tutorial but
55:51 - everything that I covered here is still
55:53 - exactly how I handle saving loading
55:55 - nowadays so yep that's pretty much it
55:59 - use relay or steam. net no I'm using the
56:02 - regular un relay uh yep so yeah I'm not
56:06 - using any of steam's networking uh okay
56:09 - let me just get this
56:10 - one just to get a bunch of waste
56:14 - gathered just put the waste in there
56:17 - like
56:19 - that uh okay so let make a grab machine
56:22 - and I don't have oh right cuz this one
56:24 - is making tons of green
56:25 - and that one has no power go on power it
56:27 - I probably need another dinky to add
56:29 - power cuz there are a bunch of things
56:32 - constantly running out of
56:34 - power the world goals yes yes I know I
56:37 - know so let me add some power into this
56:41 - whole area right here and for the crate
56:43 - container from this one and there you go
56:46 - that should help out a bit more with the
56:51 - power he's using Unity really costly to
56:53 - make p top here I mean it all uh really
56:56 - is paid based on concurrency so it
56:58 - really depends I mean my game uh I don't
57:03 - think I went past the free limit so yep
57:05 - even though the game has sold 1,000
57:07 - copies it did not go over the free limit
57:10 - so I'm still not going to have to pay 1
57:12 - cent for the Relay so I'm definitely I'm
57:14 - definitely happy with that so yeah if
57:16 - you got small Indie Games then yeah just
57:19 - using basic uh un relay is probably
57:22 - going to work quite well
57:26 - okay so yeah I got to say I'm feeling my
57:30 - voice quite a bit messed up so I think
57:32 - I'm going to just go for a little bit
57:33 - more did you make DFX by yourself or use
57:36 - some pre-made assets yeah pretty much
57:38 - everything visual is pre-made assets
57:40 - although of course that I modify all
57:42 - sorts of things myself but yeah most of
57:45 - the visuals are really just pre-made
57:47 - things that I modify and use for my own
57:50 - use case and so on but yeah most of it
57:52 - done by proper artists that's why I
57:54 - think I think the game looks quite good
57:56 - that's because the assets were obviously
57:58 - made by someone professional so there
58:00 - you go I've got eight mines is that
58:01 - going to be enough boom there you go
58:03 - that nice little I think that's from the
58:06 - cyti particle effects pack oh there you
58:09 - go okay so I still need a bunch more
58:11 - mines I should probably just get some
58:14 - towers and for that I need to start
58:17 - researching the tower which then I'm
58:18 - going to need electronics and so on so
58:20 - yep still quite a few things left to do
58:23 - so let me just put this here like that
58:26 - are you satisfied with the game results
58:28 - on Steam and steam deck do you mean in
58:30 - terms of sales yep and do you mean in
58:32 - terms of performance also yep I mean the
58:35 - game runs really well on the steam deck
58:37 - I was surprised at how performant the
58:39 - game was and putting it on the steam
58:42 - deck was actually surprisingly easy it
58:44 - was one of those things that really just
58:46 - implemented just gam pad support which
58:47 - is the gamad that I'm using just basic
58:49 - Xbox support and yep everything worked
58:52 - quite well so yeah so far I'm quite
58:53 - happy with the game both in terms in
58:54 - terms of the game itself in terms of
58:56 - results and in terms of terms of any
58:59 - everything really this uh this project
59:01 - has gone quite well and I still got tons
59:03 - of ideas for things that I want to do in
59:04 - the
59:05 - future uh
59:07 - [Music]
59:08 - right I don't learn design patterns and
59:11 - write clean code I mean the best thing
59:12 - that I can say is really just focus on
59:14 - writing clean code as long as you're
59:15 - focusing on that you're going to improve
59:17 - little by little and if you want quite a
59:22 - bit I highly recommend where's my camera
59:25 - the book code complete too so yeah if
59:28 - you read through this whole thing these
59:30 - are like I don't know 1 th000 Pages yeah
59:33 - 800 yeah 800 900 pages so if you read
59:37 - through this whole thing and if you
59:38 - fully understand it then yep you will
59:40 - massively improve your own clean code
59:41 - skills so I highly recommend the book
59:44 - I'm constantly reading and rereading it
59:45 - because it really is that
59:50 - good okay boy sry midday
59:53 - song
59:57 - use an audio solution nope in terms of
60:00 - audio it's prob just super basic unity
60:03 - audio control so really don't have
60:05 - anything too special in terms of audio
60:07 - it is all super basic oh let me just
60:10 - build the beginning of the rocket and I
60:12 - think that's going to be it so let me
60:13 - just put that one in there okay let me
60:16 - actually modify you go and pick up
60:18 - ingots let me pick up this one put it in
60:21 - there and that one in there and there
60:23 - you go pick up some ingots
60:24 - [Music]
60:27 - just started kitchen cows oh that's
60:28 - awesome yeah I'm really happy with with
60:31 - how that course came out seems people
60:32 - really enjoyed it so yeah I hope you
60:34 - learn quite a
60:36 - lot it's a book to get better in mind
60:38 - what about Fitness get fit with monkey G
60:41 - actually in terms of Fitness I did buy
60:43 - the uh encyclopedia where am
60:53 - I
61:00 - terms of that I actually heard great
61:02 - things about this book it's another one
61:04 - that is super massive but yeah in terms
61:06 - of in terms of Fitness yeah I heard
61:08 - great things about this and yeah
61:10 - definitely something that I want to
61:12 - learn about it's got lots of images lots
61:13 - of things tons of numbers lots of things
61:16 - so yeah I guess if you want to learn
61:18 - about Fitness then yeah a super huge
61:20 - book that this one I assume this one
61:23 - will do the same thing for understanding
61:25 - about Fitness the way that the other one
61:27 - did for my understanding of programming
61:28 - so yeah that's definitely something that
61:30 - I want to learn and read quite a lot as
61:34 - soon as I have the time so yeah uh okay
61:38 - what was I doing let me just make the
61:41 - the rocket can I build it I just need
61:43 - some of those so there you go pick up a
61:45 - bunch of
61:46 - those two options of books
61:50 - yep learn Game Dev and recently finished
61:53 - DD three tutorials What would would you
61:54 - suggest I do next I would suggest that
61:56 - you look at your own skills figure out
61:59 - what is the most complex game you can
62:01 - build what is just a little bit above
62:03 - your current skill set and try to do
62:05 - that basically that's how you always
62:06 - improve so you start off by making
62:08 - something like pong something super
62:09 - basic then once you learn how to make
62:12 - pong then you make I don't know Pac-Man
62:14 - then make Space Invaders then make
62:16 - something with a bit more complexity a
62:18 - bit more things so yep you make quite a
62:21 - lot of things um yep
62:25 - how did you optimize things so that is
62:27 - actually another thing that I want to
62:29 - cover in a future tutorial because I
62:31 - actually didn't use didn't do too much
62:33 - in terms of why is this thingy bug I
62:36 - think I just found the bug for this
62:37 - thingy I think I gathered that resource
62:39 - node and this one stop um let's see if
62:42 - by feeding Yeah by feeding fixes it but
62:44 - yeah that was a a fun but okay so I need
62:46 - some mines and thanks so much n the VAC
62:49 - for the Super Chat thank you so much
62:51 - yeah it's another Super Chat with oh
62:54 - okay so the one means the first Super on
62:56 - the live stream okay that's
62:58 - interesting uh let make a whole bunch of
63:00 - Mines throw them in there trying to
63:08 - see uh right okay I think that should be
63:12 - enough yeah I was trying to gather some
63:15 - there you go success that's nice I
63:16 - didn't even have to look there okay so
63:20 - let's try to get that one and for that
63:21 - one I'm going to need that so there you
63:23 - go tons ofone all over the place and
63:26 - yeah okay that should be
63:29 - good how is the building placement
63:31 - working yeah right now it is just uh
63:34 - yeah right now there are no limitations
63:36 - that is something that I want to add
63:38 - because yeah if you do place them on top
63:39 - of each other then can become quite
63:42 - tricky to to work with them but at the
63:44 - same time you can always put it back in
63:45 - capsule so it's not necessarily a
63:47 - game-breaking thing but yeah I do need
63:49 - to add I don't want it to be too
63:50 - punishing but at least I don't want it
63:52 - to allow to place buildings literally
63:54 - inside another building CU that would be
63:56 - quite
63:57 - tricky yep for sound F mod I got to say
64:00 - for sound that is one of the areas of of
64:03 - Game Dev that I really know nothing
64:06 - about so yeah in terms of sound
64:09 - everything that I've heard yeah people
64:10 - recommend using
64:12 - fod
64:14 - so yeah I'm definitely not the right
64:16 - person to talk about that but in general
64:18 - I would say fod is a great
64:21 - tool I have done the animation on UI
64:23 - elements I mean the basic is really just
64:27 - using a field that I talked about a a
64:30 - while
64:31 - ago I'm using the F AET in order to do
64:34 - some basic animations so I mentioned
64:36 - that a while ago oh boy my voice yeah I
64:39 - think I'm going to I think I'm at my
64:41 - limit uh yeah so basically it is feel
64:43 - and I think I've got some regular
64:45 - animations as well like on my 3D
64:49 - canvas I thought I had an animation on
64:52 - this one but
64:54 - all right I've got the animation on each
64:56 - individual uh so let me actually thank
64:59 - you so much for the Super Chat let me
65:01 - just
65:02 - resume oh boy this gets there are way
65:05 - too many things happening at once uh let
65:07 - me go inside this one there you go the
65:08 - item grab machine and just go back and
65:12 - the atom grab machine Yep this one has
65:13 - an animation it literally is just a
65:15 - regular animation so just inside I put a
65:18 - container that is the only thing that I
65:20 - animate and then inside I put all the
65:22 - contents for the various things
65:24 - obviously different UI are going to have
65:25 - different contents but basically just
65:27 - got this simple thing and just with an
65:28 - animation just goes up jumps up and so
65:31 - on so we just modifying the position so
65:33 - on but it's really just a regular
65:36 - animation and it's a regular animated
65:38 - controller which over here really just
65:41 - has just one parameter just one
65:43 - animation that's it super basy you have
65:46 - it angled yeah I really I really like
65:48 - that it's a tiny tiny thing it's really
65:50 - just 15 degrees but I really like the
65:52 - the feel of how it looks like so just
65:54 - using a 3D canvas so just a canvas with
65:56 - a camera just adding a slight angle and
65:59 - looks pretty nice so that's that's I'm
66:01 - really happy that I implemented cuz the
66:03 - uh inspecting the objects is really
66:06 - something that I think looks quite nice
66:08 - super simple but nice oh boy okay my
66:12 - voice
66:15 - is yes let me just place down
66:19 - the uh did I build the rocket
66:23 - already
66:24 - nope still need one more sorry you build
66:26 - the rocket now let me just place down
66:29 - the rocket and I think that's going to
66:31 - be it and I don't know if my voice is
66:33 - working this afternoon maybe I'll come
66:35 - back and continue this game and actually
66:37 - do some game developing cuz that was
66:39 - that was kind of G doing a little bit of
66:42 - game developing but yeah didn't quite
66:43 - work out but anyways
66:45 - yeah all right so yeah I think that's
66:47 - going to be it cuz yeah my voice I can
66:50 - barely talk so yeah it's definitely it
66:53 - definitely is a skill to be able to do
66:55 - to be able to do live streaming talk at
66:58 - the same time definitely is a skill when
67:00 - that hopefully over time I won't gather
67:01 - it but yeah not
67:03 - yet all right so yeah I think that's
67:06 - going to be it so just wondering if
67:09 - there's a way to get publisher when I
67:11 - pish it there early access the answer is
67:12 - contact Publishers there are some of
67:14 - them that do Early Access games and some
67:16 - that don't so yeah all right so yeah I
67:18 - think that's going to be it so yeah
67:20 - thank you all so much for being here I
67:21 - hope you found this interesting and
67:22 - useful I try to answer as many questions
67:24 - as I could so yeah plenty of tutorials
67:27 - on various of the things that I talked
67:28 - about so going in a bit more detail but
67:31 - yeah thanks C uh yeah so thank you all
67:34 - everyone and yeah let me just just save
67:38 - just make sure that I've got this thing
67:40 - and yeah
67:41 - okay so prepare everything let me just
67:45 - turn on the background and I'm going to
67:48 - have to rest my voice for a little
67:51 - bit all right so yeah yeah hope
67:53 - hopefully live streams more in the
67:55 - future but anyways okay so yeah thank
67:57 - you all so much for being here and
