00:00 - all right so it's finally time it's out
00:02 - right now you can go ahead and play the
00:03 - free demo for my game dinky Guardians
00:05 - right now the game has a nice mix of
00:07 - automation mechanics with some Colony
00:09 - building some defense and resource
00:10 - Gathering elements these are from
00:12 - scratch and calling your very first
00:13 - stinky and build your Colony bit by bit
00:15 - you can give dinky some orders so they
00:17 - can help you gather resources gather
00:19 - power and so on you must keep them fed
00:21 - and keep them safe so if the zombies
00:22 - attack pick them up throw the dinky away
00:24 - and hit the zombie with a punch or
00:26 - alternatively build some Towers to
00:28 - defend your Colony then you can research
00:29 - new buildings and items on the tech tree
00:31 - change from manual power to automated
00:33 - power build all kinds of machines to do
00:36 - work for you then keep exploring and
00:38 - expanding until your colony is nice and
00:39 - safe and fully sustainable when it's all
00:42 - automated then you can build a rocket
00:43 - and throw yourself in the dinkies into
00:45 - space that's the core gameplay of the
00:47 - demo I really hope you'll like it it was
00:49 - very tricky to get a demo down in such a
00:50 - short amount of time but I'm really
00:51 - happy with how it came out although I do
00:53 - wish I had some time for polish in terms
00:56 - of mechanics pretty much everything is
00:57 - there but in terms of Polish definitely
00:59 - would like to have a bit more but at the
01:00 - same time this is just a demo so it's
01:02 - only the very beginning I would pretty
01:04 - much call this an alpha build I
01:06 - definitely need to take a mini break
01:07 - after working so hard for these past few
01:09 - weeks but I'm still planning to continue
01:10 - working on the demo and fixing any
01:12 - issues that happened this week there's
01:13 - still a long journey to go until the
01:15 - final punch game there's tons more
01:17 - things that I want to add improve and
01:18 - polish for the final release so I'm very
01:20 - much looking forward to reading all of
01:22 - your feedback especially in terms of
01:23 - game design I've been working like crazy
01:25 - to get all of these systems and
01:26 - mechanics all of those finally working
01:27 - but I haven't had much time to iterate
01:30 - upon the core game design so I really
01:31 - want to hear what you think about it
01:33 - perhaps you feel it's too easy or too
01:34 - hard perhaps there's too many or too few
01:36 - denkis too many or too few zombies too
01:38 - many or too few resources go ahead and
01:40 - play the game and post your thoughts
01:42 - either on the comments of this video or
01:43 - on these theme forms I'll be refreshing
01:45 - that every time I can so go ahead and
01:47 - download the free demo and give it a try
01:48 - make sure you add the game to your
01:50 - wishlist and let me know what you think
01:51 - alright so I really hope you enjoy
01:53 - playing the game thank you for watching
01:54 - and I'll see you next time
