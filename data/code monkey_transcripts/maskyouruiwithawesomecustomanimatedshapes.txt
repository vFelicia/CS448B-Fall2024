00:00 - in this video we're going to learn how
00:01 - to make a custom UI mesh mask this way
00:04 - we can make a mesh out of any shape and
00:05 - mask out multiple parts of our UI while
00:08 - using just a single mask let's begin
00:13 - [Music]
00:17 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:19 - and this channel is all about helping
00:21 - you will learn how to make your own
00:22 - games with nf2 torrents made by a
00:24 - professional indie game developer so if
00:26 - you find the video helpful consider
00:27 - subscribing ok so this is one of those
00:30 - videos where I had a problem I did some
00:32 - research and I couldn't really find easy
00:33 - solution so if you're researching the
00:35 - same thing that I was which is how to
00:37 - making a mesh mask in the UI then
00:39 - hopefully this video won't help you now
00:41 - I need this because I wanted to mask
00:43 - multiple parts of the UI I wanted to
00:46 - have multiple lines of text and smoothly
00:48 - reveal each of them you can easily make
00:50 - a mask by creating a UI object adding an
00:52 - image and a mask component and then put
00:54 - whatever you want to mask as a child of
00:56 - that object however in doing it this way
00:58 - you don't mean to do just this image you
01:00 - can mask multiple children but you
01:02 - cannot mask using multiple parents so
01:04 - you cannot compose a mask of multiple
01:06 - objects now one simple solution is to
01:08 - make a texture with the Alpha Channel in
01:10 - the shape that you want
01:11 - so using this texture with two squares
01:13 - and yep it shows both parts of the
01:15 - annoying object however now we using
01:18 - this approach we're working with
01:19 - textures which makes animation relly
01:21 - tricky if I want to animate this I would
01:23 - need to smoothly make some of the mask
01:25 - pixels visible and that would be a very
01:27 - clunky way of doing things I was working
01:29 - on the code monkey steam app which by
01:31 - the way you can connect on link in the
01:32 - description to add it to your wish list
01:34 - I wanted to have some text on the
01:36 - interactive tutorials and using math to
01:38 - show parts of it over time so I needed
01:40 - to combine a mesh with a custom shape
01:42 - that I could easily animate to follow
01:43 - multiple text lines ok so here's what
01:46 - we're going to talk over here is this
01:48 - text object we just a buncha tests and
01:50 - it's inside a mask object now as I press
01:53 - point yep there you go you can see that
01:55 - the mask object is growing and smoothly
01:57 - showing the text now if we pause we can
01:59 - look at the mask and if there's the
02:02 - shape growing which shows the text
02:03 - behind it so we can hide the mask
02:04 - graphic and yep that's how it looks so
02:06 - far doing for a single line will work
02:08 - just fine using a simple image but then
02:10 - the issue is we want this mask to stay
02:13 - invisible and we aren't an add an other
02:15 - one so that we can continue masking out
02:17 - the various other lines so over here is
02:19 - the final result using multiple quads to
02:22 - make a single mesh mask over here you
02:24 - can see the final misshape which is a
02:26 - single mesh which itself is composed of
02:28 - three separate quads
02:29 - so you can build whatever mesh shape you
02:31 - want either through code or by manually
02:33 - building a mesh and using it as a mask
02:36 - so this is how you can make a custom
02:38 - mesh to mask out your UI this videos

03:05 - keep the videos free for everyone all
03:07 - right so this circle let's get to it
03:09 - okay so here we are in our starring
03:11 - scene and let's go into the UI canvas
03:14 - here and let's create a text object
03:24 - alright so here's some basic text now we
03:27 - want to mask it so let's first look at
03:29 - how a basic UI mask works and the way we
03:32 - do that is we create a new UI let's make
03:34 - it an image then here we add a component
03:37 - we add a mask component and now to mask
03:40 - something we just need to make it a
03:41 - child of this object so just drag that
03:43 - one on there and yep just like that the
03:45 - text is now only visible whilst inside
03:47 - the shape of this image now right now
03:50 - the source image in here is set to null
03:52 - so this is displaying a basic rectangle
03:54 - but you can assign any texture in here
03:56 - so for example let's use a circle and
03:59 - there you go now the mass takes on the
04:00 - shape of a circle so this is how you
04:02 - make a very basic mask you have the
04:04 - parent with an image and a mask and then
04:06 - you have whatever children you want and
04:08 - it masks out the children now the issue
04:10 - comes when let's say that we want to
04:12 - show this part of the text and then this
04:14 - part as well now since masks works based
04:17 - on the shape of the parent we can only
04:19 - have a single mask shape so the mask
04:21 - works based on what this image is
04:23 - rendered now like I said when possible
04:25 - approach is to make a texture with the
04:27 - shape that you want so down here I have
04:29 - this texture here just two squares and
04:32 - the rest of it is alpha transparent so
04:35 - if instead I apply this one and yep just
04:37 - like that I am masking out two parts of
04:39 - the underlying object so if your goal is
04:42 - just a fixed mass CheY
04:43 - then this approach won't do however
04:45 - since this is based on a texture and
04:47 - it's alpha Channel it makes it very
04:48 - tricky to modify in order to modify it I
04:51 - would have to play around with setting
04:52 - these pixels to fully opaque and so and
04:55 - so on so that would not be the best
04:56 - approach so instead let's create a
04:58 - custom mask shape let's create a new C
05:01 - sharp script call this the mesh mask ey
05:05 - and now here we're going to create our
05:07 - own custom mask type now to do that we
05:10 - just need to extend instead of
05:11 - monobehaviour we're going to extend mask
05:13 - upon graphic which is inside using unity
05:18 - engine dot UI so there it is let's just
05:23 - hit save and see now here and let's
05:25 - remove the mask and our image component
05:27 - and send let's add our nice script and
05:29 - yep just like that already shows a few
05:31 - fields so these are on from the mask
05:33 - eval graphic base class now for now
05:35 - let's leave everything at default let's
05:37 - just change the color to a nice green to
05:39 - make it very visible all right now back
05:42 - in the code here in order to make our
05:44 - custom mesh we're going to override one
05:46 - of the functions it's called the
05:47 - populate mesh now this one gets called
05:52 - automatically by the UI system to create
05:54 - the mesh of our mask ammonal graphic and
05:56 - this function has an argument of type
05:58 - vertex helper so it's a nice humper
06:00 - class to help us handle mesh shapes now
06:02 - the first thing we do is to make sure
06:04 - that you clear whatever the current
06:05 - shape of our mesh is so you're going to
06:07 - the vertex comfort and we just call
06:09 - clear okay and now it's in here that we
06:13 - can set up our customized shape so let's
06:14 - start off with a very simple square all
06:20 - right we have to find a position for all
06:22 - our vertices and then we just access the
06:24 - vertex helper to add a UI vertex quad
06:35 - all right so just like that now one
06:38 - thing here in order for this to actually
06:39 - work we need to give the UI vertex a
06:41 - color if you only were to add empty it
06:44 - just won't work I'm not sure why but
06:46 - just give it a random color and it works
06:48 - so this is really all it takes we clear
06:50 - the current my shape and then we add our
06:52 - custom vertices and if we go back into
06:54 - the editor any for any way we see our
06:57 - mask shape so here there is just basic
06:59 - quad with 50 by 50 all right great
07:02 - so our object is creating the mesh and
07:05 - making it masculine and in order to make
07:07 - it an actual mask we just need to add
07:09 - the mask component and just like that
07:11 - yep there it is and we can either show
07:13 - or hide the mask graphic okay so now
07:15 - let's see how this helps us solve the
07:17 - original problem of having a mask with
07:19 - multiple shapes down here we can make
07:21 - another UI vertex quad alright so we
07:31 - have our original quad and one next to
07:33 - it and if we go back and if there is we
07:36 - have our two visual quads so we have a
07:38 - single mask parent and by using a custom
07:41 - mesh we can mask out multiple areas of
07:43 - our underlying object so there it is
07:45 - alright awesome now we need to do is
07:47 - really just extend upon this concept so
07:50 - here let's try and making our mask let's
07:52 - just increase the size over time all
07:58 - right just like that we should see a
08:00 - rectangle stretching however when you go
08:02 - back here it doesn't actually work so
08:04 - our mesh shape is not actually
08:06 - increasing that is because we are
08:08 - missing one thing which is in here the
08:10 - UI system only calls this function when
08:12 - it absolutely needs you meaning that it
08:14 - does not call it automatically on every
08:16 - frame so if we want to do that we can
08:19 - make our predatory update and in here we
08:21 - tell it to update on vertices so we just
08:24 - go set vertices as dirty and they won't
08:26 - update so just like that now this should
08:29 - update on every frame and if there it is
08:31 - now we have our custom mess shape and
08:33 - mating over time awesome all right so
08:36 - now with this you can obviously use
08:38 - whatever mashup you want it doesn't have
08:40 - to be just a simple rectangle so for
08:43 - example you could make a mesh in the
08:44 - shape of a star and just rotate around
08:45 - or really any
08:47 - you want to animate and in any way you
08:49 - want alright so here is the final script
09:06 - that I made for the code monkey steam
09:08 - app it has the mesh mesh UI script then
09:11 - as a child of it it has the same text
09:13 - object and then over here I have a
09:15 - container with a bunch of children and
09:17 - each of them has a simple script just
09:18 - with two fields so just a fold for the
09:21 - start time and another one for the total
09:23 - time so that's eternal amount of time
09:25 - that this rectangle will take to reach
09:26 - its final shape so this object has this
09:28 - shape and each of them is covering one
09:30 - line and then they must mesh you why
09:32 - over here has a reference to the mask
09:34 - container and it simply applies those
09:36 - masks let's see there it is and all of a
09:38 - sudden yep there you go there's the
09:40 - masked shape being created over time so
09:42 - here it is with the game and the scene
09:43 - view side by side and you can indeed see
09:45 - the mesh shape constantly growing so
09:47 - this is a great way to smoothly scroll
09:49 - over some text in any matter you want as
09:51 - I said I researched this while working
09:53 - on the code monkey steam app if you
09:55 - haven't yet then please check the link
09:57 - in the description and add it to your
09:58 - wish list I'm trying to build something
09:59 - really cool and it should hopefully be
10:01 - out sometime next month
