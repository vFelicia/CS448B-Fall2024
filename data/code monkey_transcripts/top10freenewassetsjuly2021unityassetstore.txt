00:07 - coming out every month so in this video
00:09 - let's check out some highlights that
00:10 - were released in june 2021

00:14 - list of three assets in the next ones i
00:16 - will be covering paid assets and tools
00:18 - check out the phone playlist to see all
00:19 - of the highlights every month you might
00:21 - find something that would be perfect for
00:23 - whatever project you're currently
00:24 - working on
00:24 - and by the way check out my own asks on
00:26 - the store so far i've made the free key
00:29 - door system which is a super simple way
00:30 - to add keys and doors to your game
00:32 - and the mouse cursor system pro which is
00:34 - a very easy to use tool to help you
00:36 - create custom animated cursors to help
00:38 - really make your game stand out i'm
00:40 - currently working on converting some
00:42 - more videos into pro system so stay
00:44 - tuned for that
00:44 - alright so starting off actually with
00:47 - two packs in one
00:48 - the third and first person character
00:50 - controllers these are made officially by
00:52 - unity
00:53 - they are some simple but very capable
00:55 - assets meant to help you very quickly
00:57 - get your characters working
00:58 - they are made using cinemachine and the
01:00 - new input system packages
01:02 - for the third person controller you have
01:04 - a fully rigged and animated humanoid
01:06 - character
01:07 - as well as one working on a simple
01:08 - capsule the animator is very easy to
01:11 - extend and build upon
01:12 - and then for the first person controller
01:14 - it works exactly as you would expect in
01:16 - first person
01:16 - then you've got a playground scene to
01:18 - test out the characters with all kinds
01:20 - of jumps stairs and slopes
01:21 - both assets also include overlays for
01:24 - mobile so you've got
01:25 - on-screen joysticks and touch zones to
01:27 - instantly make the characters work on a
01:29 - mobile device these are two excellent
01:31 - starting points
01:32 - just import these assets and immediately
01:34 - get to work on your next idea
01:36 - next up an interesting road system it's
01:39 - essentially a spline editor with a
01:41 - terrain mesh
01:42 - i actually cover the tutorial on how to
01:44 - do something like this in a video
01:45 - previously
01:46 - go watch that if you want to learn how
01:47 - it's made this seems like a very easy to
01:50 - use system
01:50 - you just place a bunch of points
01:52 - wherever you want rotate them to add
01:54 - some elevation and some smooth curves
01:56 - then make them connect and set up some
01:58 - intersections once you set it up you can
02:00 - get a graph with all the nodes and their
02:02 - weights which means you can also easily
02:03 - apply pathfinding system on top of it
02:05 - also you can swap out the road meshes
02:07 - for your own if you have a specific art
02:09 - style in mind
02:10 - then if you're working on something that
02:11 - involves an office well here is an ice
02:13 - pack
02:14 - it's got quite a lot of assets for a
02:16 - free asset a bunch of chairs tables tv
02:19 - walls doors and so on also has some more
02:22 - sci-fi elements
02:23 - like some mechanical arms some several
02:24 - racks and a bunch more
02:26 - if you like this pack and you want even
02:28 - more assets you can grab the paid
02:29 - version with 350 total assets
02:32 - for some ui here is a simple and clean
02:34 - beautiful interface
02:36 - it's a collection of buttons windows
02:38 - toggles pop-ups and more
02:40 - all of it nice and smoothly animated so
02:42 - it's very simple but very satisfying
02:44 - maybe you need some old-school weapons
02:46 - if so here is a free
02:47 - m1a1 submachine gun it's a really nice
02:50 - model of a very iconic weapon
02:52 - perfect for any kind of world war ii
02:54 - game it's got some very high-res
02:57 - 4k textures the weapon is set up with
02:59 - moving parts so you can easily animate
03:01 - it
03:01 - and again if you like the look of this
03:03 - one you can check out the many more
03:04 - weapons made by this same developer
03:06 - for some pixel art here's a bunch of
03:08 - pixel cars
03:09 - quite a lot of variety in the shapes
03:11 - everything from some normal cars to a
03:13 - bunch of vans
03:14 - you've got some pickup trucks and some
03:16 - high-end sports cars
03:17 - they are nice and clean designs so if
03:19 - you're working on a side-scrolling pixel
03:21 - game then get this one
03:22 - for a free tool here is the 2d ai tool
03:25 - it's a pretty complex tool that comes
03:27 - with a graph interface for you to
03:29 - visually manage states and develop your
03:31 - ai it's got tons of complexity but
03:33 - also says that it's easy to use contains
03:35 - a fully documented c-sharp api
03:38 - if you want to make some ai with a
03:39 - visual tool then maybe look into this
03:41 - one
03:41 - also there's a pro version of this tool
03:43 - if you like what it does
03:45 - next up some low poly stylized hyper
03:47 - cars so you've got a ford gt and look
03:50 - alike
03:50 - a la ferrari and a bugatti chiron it's a
03:53 - pretty simple and useful pack
03:54 - all the cars have two versions one with
03:56 - or without interiors
03:58 - or maybe you need some icons here is a
04:00 - nice pack with a bunch of minerals
04:02 - contains 48 pixel art icons so it's
04:05 - perfect if you're working on some sort
04:07 - of mining game so maybe something like
04:08 - seymour
04:09 - dig really great pixel art designs and
04:12 - lastly another interesting tool urp
04:14 - decals it does exactly what it says you
04:17 - place some decals on top of your
04:18 - surfaces when working with urp
04:20 - it supports normal maps and also
04:22 - receives shadows so it's great if you
04:24 - need to spawn some graffiti or maybe
04:26 - some buttholes
04:27 - alright so those are my top 10 free new
04:29 - assets on the unity asset store released
