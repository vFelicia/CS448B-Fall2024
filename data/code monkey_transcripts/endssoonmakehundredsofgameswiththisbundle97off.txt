01:41 - mountain of information for how the
01:42 - algorithm works if you want to find
01:44 - success on seam you definitely do need
01:45 - to read this homepage and also include a
01:47 - section for the interesting videos that
01:48 - I saw recently for example a really
01:50 - interesting technical video for how
01:51 - Unity games can be hacked it's great to
01:53 - see how it actually works in the back
01:54 - end then a great video talking about how
01:56 - microchips are made and another great
01:58 - video on GTA 4 and how Nik B is really
02:00 - one of the best characters ever written
02:01 - I'm also still doing the normal Game Dev
02:03 - report videos I'm hoping to make one of
02:05 - these next week but those videos take a
02:06 - ton of work to make so I can't really do
02:08 - them very often whereas I can definitely
02:09 - write newsletter to keep you up to date
02:11 - much more regular so if you want to stay
02:12 - up to date with everything going on this
02:13 - Indy sign up on the website and fourthly
02:15 - quick update on my upcoming dots RTS
02:17 - course I've been hard at work on
02:19 - building the protype and I've got most
02:20 - of it working right now most of the
02:22 - complex systems that I want to research
02:23 - and build are now working it was
02:25 - definitely an interesting challenge to
02:26 - research how to build flow field pathf
02:28 - find directly inside of dots so it's
02:29 - been fun to research this however I'm
02:31 - must say this also turned out to be
02:32 - quite a bit more complex than I thought
02:34 - I thought I could build this prototype
02:35 - in some like 20 to 30 hours but it's
02:36 - taking closer to 60 so I have no clue
02:38 - how long the final course will be the
02:40 - next episode start writing the lectures
02:42 - one by one which is definitely going to
02:43 - be a huge challenge considering I have
02:45 - to take all of this all these scripts I
02:47 - have to take all this and organize it
02:48 - and make it work in a way that makes
02:50 - sense in a step-by-step lecture course
02:52 - so still not sure on the exact timeline
02:53 - but hopefully I should have a better
02:55 - idea by the end of this month you can
02:56 - sign up with your email directly on the
02:58 - course page and I'll let you know when
02:59 - it's out all right so that's four quick
