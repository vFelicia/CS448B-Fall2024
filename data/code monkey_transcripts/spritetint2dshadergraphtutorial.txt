00:00 - in this video we're going to make a nice
00:01 - Brighton shader using Sheila Brown we're
00:04 - going to make both a multiply tenth and
00:06 - a soliton this is a great shader to make
00:08 - Hill and damage effects for your sprites
00:10 - let's begin
00:14 - [Music]
00:18 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:21 - and this channel is all about helping
00:22 - you learn how to make your own games
00:24 - with nf2 torrents made by a professional
00:26 - indie game developer so if you find the
00:28 - video helpful consider subscribing okay
00:30 - so this is what we're trying to make
00:32 - over here is my normal sprite
00:34 - now I can press this button and there
00:36 - you go you can see how it flash green as
00:38 - if I consumed a health item and I can
00:40 - press another button and there you go it
00:43 - flash red as if to display damage so
00:45 - here we have a nice add color effect but
00:48 - we can also use the other shader for the
00:50 - salutant so I stopped the shader and hit
00:52 - the color and there you go now we have a
00:54 - flat solid color tint the tin color and
00:59 - the script are set through code the
01:01 - script for handling this is very simple
01:03 - we just have this simple script which
01:05 - has a color and a fade speed and on an
01:08 - update we simply lower the Alpha and
01:10 - apply to our tint properly and here in
01:12 - the inspector we can see the shader has
01:14 - two fields one for the base color and
01:16 - one for the tent and in here with an
01:18 - alpha of 0 you can see these pride is
01:20 - normal and as we increase it becomes
01:22 - fully tinted so this is one effect that
01:25 - applies an add tint so there it is very
01:27 - nice and this is the other effect that
01:29 - applies a solid color tint and again we
01:32 - just move the Alpha alright so this is
01:35 - our goal let's get to it ok so here I am
01:38 - in my scene now let's go over here into
01:40 - the project files and create a new
01:43 - shader go down here to the 2d renderer
01:46 - and make a sprite lit graph let's call
01:48 - this our tint ok here we are inside of
01:51 - shader graph now let's begin by going
01:53 - over here into our properties and make a
01:55 - property for our first texture let's set
01:58 - the reference to be underscore main text
02:01 - so this is our main texture and for
02:03 - default I'm going to select the
02:05 - spreadsheet there's a default
02:07 - spreadsheet okay now let's write texture
02:10 - all the way in here and now we simple it
02:12 - so with a sample texture 2d and just
02:15 - connect the texture in there ok now we
02:17 - simply connect the RGB a over here to
02:20 - the master color and you can already see
02:22 - it in here and let's just replace this
02:24 - with a quat ok so far so good
02:27 - we have our nice quad now let's just
02:29 - test this so in here we click on say
02:31 - facet
02:31 - and now back here in the editor let's
02:34 - make a material to use our shader so
02:36 - over here make a new material and in
02:40 - here we can select the shader so we go
02:42 - down into shader graphs and we select
02:44 - our shader okay there it is it already
02:47 - has default texture and everything great
02:48 - so now let's see this in game and if
02:51 - there is the character just standing
02:52 - around looking perfectly normal okay so
02:54 - far so good now let's apply a base color
02:57 - just like any sprite has its base color
02:59 - so back in here let's make a new color
03:02 - properly well let's call this the
03:04 - underscore color and by default set it
03:07 - to white with foam alpha okay
03:09 - now drag it into our graph now we have
03:11 - here our color and here our texture so
03:14 - we can simply multiply both of them
03:16 - multiply the color 2d texture so you can
03:20 - see on the preview that if we change the
03:21 - color there it is we are changing this
03:23 - sprite so now let's test this out and
03:25 - send the out straight into the color in
03:27 - there let's save the acident test any
03:30 - appears our character with our tint so
03:32 - you can see here on the inspector that
03:34 - we have our color field and we can
03:35 - change this in order to tint our sprite
03:37 - all right great however this is not
03:40 - really the tint that we want to make
03:41 - this is just the base so with this one
03:43 - we can modify the base color as well as
03:46 - the base alpha so just like that these
03:47 - prior two vanishes what we're really
03:49 - trying to do is build a tent on top of
03:51 - this one so let's do that so we're here
03:54 - let's make a new color call this our
03:56 - tint and make the reference underscore
03:59 - tint let's set the base color to phone
04:02 - white okay normal and 4/10 let's set it
04:04 - on green and half alpha okay so up here
04:07 - let's drag the property and I mean here
04:10 - it would seem that we simply multiply
04:12 - the tent by the texture down here so the
04:15 - multiply node with this color and this
04:16 - texture just like this however if we do
04:20 - it like this then we end up with the
04:21 - same tent as before as the Alpha goes
04:23 - down the texture becomes transparent so
04:25 - that's not what we want we want the tint
04:28 - alpha to only apply to the 10th color so
04:30 - in here before we multiply these two
04:33 - let's first split our tint color so in
04:35 - here we make a splint node then we input
04:38 - our color and now we have the RGB and a
04:40 - fields so then we take a combined node
04:44 - and combine just the corner so the are G
04:47 - and D B so we don't touch the a so we're
04:50 - here we have a corner without alpha and
04:52 - now we can simply do a multiply and we
04:55 - multiply the alpha by the color that
04:57 - comes out in here so what we've done
05:03 - here is we're applying our alpha to the
05:04 - color and not to the actual transparency
05:06 - so if we modify the attending here if we
05:09 - modify the alpha and go down this one
05:11 - does not become transparent but rather
05:12 - it becomes black so put it up and we
05:14 - have the full color put the Alpha down
05:16 - and we have black alright so with this
05:18 - we can now take this and make a add node
05:21 - and here we add this color on to our
05:25 - texture in here so it really this
05:27 - multiply and instead we have the add add
05:30 - it with this one and then we put her out
05:32 - in here so now you can see over here on
05:35 - the preview our effect as we increase
05:37 - the alpha it becomes fully tinted in
05:39 - green as we decrease the alpha it just
05:41 - becomes the base color so this is
05:43 - exactly how we want our effect to work
05:45 - however if we test this out and just
05:48 - like that you can see an issue now the
05:50 - tint is actually working as intended
05:52 - so in here as I increase its fully
05:54 - tinted as I decrease we have just the
05:56 - base right however the tint is also
05:58 - being applied to the parts that are
05:59 - supposed to be transparent so we need to
06:01 - apply transparency separate from the
06:03 - tent so back in our graph let's go down
06:06 - here and we want to grab the Alpha
06:08 - Channel from our simple texture then we
06:11 - want to take it on to a multiply node so
06:14 - we take the Alpha then we want to
06:16 - multiply it with the color alpha so that
06:18 - means we need to split these four values
06:20 - into four separate values so we use a
06:23 - split then we can take this alpha and
06:25 - multiply it in there by the base alpha
06:27 - and just like down the preview you can
06:29 - see our alpha channel so if we decrease
06:31 - the base color it becomes transparent
06:33 - and on fall it has fun white on the
06:35 - Alpha okay so we can finally take this
06:37 - alpha in here and combine into the
06:39 - converse in here so let's make it
06:41 - combined now in order to combine first
06:43 - we need to split this into three
06:44 - separate values so we split this color
06:47 - then we combine it with these and we use
06:50 - the Alpha from down here and that's it
06:52 - so over here we have the main base code
06:54 - we can use this to apply a base tent and
06:57 - more importantly make the sprite either
06:59 - visible or transparent and then we have
07:01 - our tint collar and in here we can
07:03 - easily define how much tint we want to
07:05 - apply by simply modifying the Alpha so
07:07 - just like this we have max tint applied
07:09 - and just like this we have note into
07:11 - play
07:11 - okay so let's test okay so here's the
07:14 - character with no tenth and as you can
07:16 - see the transparency problem has been
07:18 - fixed so now in here on the inspector we
07:20 - can see our tint field so we can take
07:22 - this and apply a green tint and all
07:25 - we're going to do is simply increase the
07:26 - Alpha so just like this it becomes
07:28 - couple of like tinted now we go down and
07:31 - becomes empty so just like that we have
07:33 - our tint working perfectly we can use
07:35 - any color we want and make it very
07:36 - tinted or not tinted at all so I can use
07:39 - this with a simple script and apply a
07:41 - fading tint on keypress so I press this
07:44 - key and there you go there's a nice
07:45 - green tint as if the character was
07:47 - healed so there it is and press another
07:50 - key and there you go there's a nice red
07:52 - tint as if the character was damaged so
07:54 - with this shader and a simple script you
07:56 - can see that we have a very nice effect
07:57 - over here is the script as you can see
08:00 - it's extremely simple it's only a couple
08:02 - of lines long up here we have our field
08:04 - so film for the material the tint color
08:06 - and the fade speed on awake we simply
08:08 - grab references to our material we
08:11 - initialize our tint color and a basic
08:13 - fate speed then we have a function to
08:15 - set the tint color and set the fade
08:17 - speed and finally over here on the
08:19 - update if the tint color has now a
08:21 - bigger than zero then we're going to
08:23 - lower the alpha by D fade speed
08:25 - multiplied by time to time and we simply
08:27 - apply the tint color into our sailor so
08:30 - this is how we modify simple properties
08:32 - in our shader here in the shader we have
08:34 - our tint color with a reference of
08:36 - underscore tint and that's exactly the
08:38 - name that we use in here in order to
08:40 - modify that property so just like this
08:42 - we have a very simple color constantly
08:43 - decreasing on the Alpha and here on the
08:46 - testing script we simply test for some
08:48 - input keys and we set it in color so
08:50 - this one two green red and blue and
08:52 - again here is the effect pressing key
08:54 - and there you go we have a very nice
08:55 - flash right awesome so now that we have
08:59 - this basic shader working let's make a
09:01 - second version that applies a complete
09:03 - solid tint using this as our base we'll
09:05 - make it very easy so here on the project
09:08 - files let's simply go to the ten
09:09 - and duplicate it and let's call this the
09:12 - 10th solid okay here's our shader now in
09:16 - here this is going to be mostly the same
09:17 - the biggest difference is up here on the
09:20 - x combined and add notes so in here
09:23 - let's get rid of the multiply node and
09:25 - we're also going to get rid of the and
09:27 - so we connect this one directly and now
09:30 - up here let's make a blend node and we
09:34 - modified the mode in order to be over
09:36 - right and now this node blends a value
09:38 - into another one based on a certain
09:40 - value so we have the base the blend and
09:42 - the opacity so you can use the base as
09:44 - our texture just like that now for the
09:47 - plant we're going to plant with our
09:49 - color and for the opacity we're going to
09:52 - use our tint alpha so you can see the
09:55 - node preview and if I increase the alpha
09:57 - on the tenth there you go it becomes a
09:58 - solid color and if it goes down it
10:00 - vanishes right so this is our solid tint
10:03 - so and with this we simply take this one
10:05 - out put it into this point then we point
10:08 - it combine it with the Alpha from down
10:10 - here and we have our output okay so here
10:12 - we have our graph and now here we simply
10:14 - go into our material instead of using
10:16 - the tint let's use the tint solid and
10:18 - let's test and okay there it is and I
10:20 - press the button and there you go
10:22 - there's a nice foam solid tint so press
10:25 - it on green on red and on blue and if we
10:29 - pause and look at the tint and let's put
10:31 - it on green and we increase the alpha
10:33 - and there you go there's a foam flat
10:35 - solid tint so we can apply this to any
10:37 - color and with the alpha it is full and
10:39 - we down it goes back to normal so here
10:42 - is the effect and again let's change for
10:45 - the previous tenant and here is the
10:47 - other effect so with these two it's up
10:50 - to you to decide which one best suits
