00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:03 - 1290. that's a number that's how many
00:05 - wishlists the game has right now so
00:07 - those are the hard numbers now let's
00:09 - interpret that is that number good or
00:10 - mad am I happy or unhappy in my
00:13 - announcement video I talked about lots
00:14 - of stats and in the end after doing some
00:16 - math based on common numbers I reached a
00:18 - nice optimistic goal of 10 000 wish
00:20 - lists in order to sell about a thousand
00:21 - copies and call the game of success So
00:23 - based on that things aren't necessarily
00:25 - going too well however I'm not too
00:27 - worried about it it does seem like I
00:29 - might hit the lower 5K wishlist gone
00:30 - which might still be enough to call the
00:32 - game of success so even though I
00:33 - obviously wish these numbers were a bit
00:35 - better I'm not too down on it here is
00:37 - the phone wishlist graph the first big
00:39 - spike this one is obviously when I made
00:41 - the announcement video then I have since
00:42 - made three more videos only to the game
00:44 - I made one where I talked about how I
00:46 - faked the multiplayer to record the game
00:48 - trailer then the first level covering a
00:50 - bit of progress
00:51 - and finally the big devlog video which
00:53 - actually did pretty well because it was
00:55 - my first video experimenting with a
00:56 - camera you can see the total graph which
00:58 - lists appear going up slowly but
01:00 - steadily each of those videos got about
01:02 - 10 to 15 000 views so potentially about
01:05 - 10 percent of viewers are interested in
01:06 - the game now in this case I have no idea
01:08 - if that's good or bad this is actually
01:10 - the first game that I'm releasing since
01:11 - this channel has a decent size my last
01:14 - release was Battle Royale Tycoon all the
01:15 - way back in 2019 and back then the
01:17 - videos on this channel only got some
01:19 - like a thousand views so I really have
01:21 - no idea if 10 of viewers interested in
01:23 - the game is good or bad since I have
01:24 - nothing to compare it to although it is
01:26 - interesting to note how my total one
01:28 - Liberation game that one which I had
01:30 - delayed for next year that one
01:31 - definitely got a ton more wishlists
01:33 - right as soon as I announce it by now
01:34 - that one is actually already past the 5K
01:36 - Mark which is really nice so it seems
01:38 - like that idea might be a bit more
01:39 - appealing to people which is great news
01:41 - for that project when I finally get back
01:43 - to it next year it should do well thanks
01:45 - to a nice amount of wishlist but anyways
01:47 - right now the focus is on dinky
01:48 - Guardians the current big deadline is
01:50 - the ECM Festival which is starting on
01:52 - the 19th I'm trying to work as hard as I
01:54 - can to get a great demo done for the
01:55 - festival if I can successfully build the
01:58 - demo that I have in my head then I
01:59 - believe the festival won't be a success
02:01 - and I believe I've seen some stats on
02:02 - how the high-end for festivals is
02:04 - something like 10 000 wish lists so I
02:06 - feel that if the game is good enough
02:07 - fine maybe I won't get let's say roughly
02:09 - about a thousand and then if the game
02:11 - gets a thousand wishlist in the festival
02:12 - then I believe it could get between two
02:14 - to three thousand until the release at
02:16 - the end of July which would mean the
02:18 - game on launch with about 5000 wish
02:19 - lists which would be a decent amount
02:20 - again like I mentioned in the
02:22 - announcement video it's very much up to
02:23 - you to Define what success means to you
02:25 - and to me for this game just publishing
02:27 - another game is one part of what I
02:28 - consider success another part is I'm
02:30 - learning how to make these devlogs and
02:32 - getting better at learning how to
02:34 - combine editing with some cameras some
02:36 - background footage that's something that
02:37 - I'm in the process of learning with
02:39 - these videos and so far I've called that
02:40 - a personal success and lastly of course
02:42 - success is selling a decent number of
02:44 - copies thankfully since I'm leaving a
02:46 - low costlying country and the dev time
02:47 - for this game is actually pretty short I
02:49 - don't actually need to sell tens of
02:51 - thousands of copies to break even if I
02:53 - end up hitting my wishlist goal I should
02:54 - be able to say the sales numbers and
02:56 - call this game a success So based on
02:58 - that one I do wish the number of
02:59 - wishlists were a bit better I'm still
03:01 - happy and the journey is progressing
03:03 - nicely the numbers are actually pretty
03:04 - decent and the game itself especially
03:06 - coming along quite nicely I would
03:07 - actually say it's coming along better
03:09 - than nicely this past week when I was
03:11 - working on adding multiplayer it was a
03:13 - bit tricky but I did get it done then I
03:15 - also spent a bunch of time thinking
03:16 - about design which by the way all of
03:18 - your answers to my design questions were
03:20 - super hit on phone so thanks so much for
03:21 - that your comments really got me
03:23 - thinking in all kinds of interesting
03:24 - mechanics stay tuned for Devon welcoming
03:26 - soon where I will talk about the process
03:28 - for adding multiplayer and what I hope
03:30 - to work on this week before the festival
03:31 - I've already uploaded the initial build
03:33 - for review so hopefully I should be able
03:35 - to get it all done in time and I'm also
03:37 - enjoying this journey of trying out this
03:38 - new format and bringing you along for
03:40 - Journey with these devlogs I hope that
03:42 - watching this Series has been
03:43 - interesting to you my advice to you on
03:45 - this topic is actually something that
03:46 - I've already mentioned many times
03:47 - wishlists are extremely important in
03:49 - team nowadays so get your steam page up
03:52 - and running as quickly as you can pretty
03:54 - much as soon as you have decided upon
03:55 - the core game idea and you have some
03:56 - visuals to show get that done and
03:58 - publish the coming soon page as soon as
04:00 - you can so you can start Gathering
04:01 - wishlists the longer you have that page
04:03 - visible the more wishlist you'll be able
04:05 - to gather so actually what I'm doing
04:06 - here making a game in a few months this
04:08 - one isn't technically the best option
04:09 - for finding massive success but again
04:11 - like I said it's up to you to Define
04:12 - what success means to you in my case my
04:15 - primary definition of success simply
04:16 - launching this game this year and if
04:18 - you're just starting out then simply
04:20 - publishing a game can be considered a
04:21 - massive success alright I hope this
04:23 - video was informative go ahead and add
04:25 - dinky Gardens here wishlist if you
04:27 - haven't already I'm really hoping to hit
04:28 - the 5K going before the final release
04:30 - thank you for watching and I'll see you
04:32 - next time
