00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - here's a super quick video about a
00:03 - really useful Visual Studio feature that
00:05 - you might not know about when working
00:07 - with Json you need to define the class
00:09 - or stru to hold the data with all the
00:11 - names and types so as an example over
00:13 - here is the YouTube API which has tons
00:15 - of endpoints this one is for listening
00:17 - videos and if we scroll down we can see
00:19 - how it's structured so here it is this
00:21 - is the structure for the response it's
00:23 - got a bunch of string fields and the
00:24 - page info and then array with all the
00:26 - items and the items are all of type
00:27 - video resource which in turn then has
00:30 - this huge definition so manually you'd
00:32 - have to build all of these films
00:33 - yourself if you want to get this Json in
00:35 - your game or app or alternatively there
00:37 - is a much simpler automated method that
00:39 - I just found out a few months ago first
00:41 - thing you do is you get the Json so over
00:43 - here I'm going to make a request on this
00:45 - endpoint let's just grab my liked videos
00:48 - then just run this query and if there
00:50 - you go here is all of the return data so
00:52 - now what I can do is just pick up all
00:54 - this Chon so let me copy the whole thing
00:56 - select it all and copy and then over
00:58 - here in Visual Studio here is the one
01:00 - second method you just go up into edit
01:02 - then go into paste special and then
01:04 - paste Json as classes and if there you
01:06 - go it creates the entire structure for
01:08 - all the Json in the clipboard so our
01:10 - entire complex Json object was
01:12 - automatically converted into a proper
01:14 - class definition you can see that on the
01:16 - root object we've got the kind e tag
01:18 - which over here yep that's exactly what
01:20 - we've got and then we've got an array of
01:22 - items for all of our video resources and
01:24 - Y here it is the same thing so we've got
01:25 - items so it has an objective type item
01:28 - so here it is it's got the kind e then
01:30 - inside we've got the snippet then the
01:31 - snippet has the channel ID title
01:33 - description and so on so the simple
01:35 - method just going into edit paste
01:37 - special and past on classes this is
01:39 - super awesome it really saves you a ton
01:40 - of work for example I have my live
01:42 - stream overlay which use the YouTube API
01:45 - when I first built it I did not know
01:46 - about this so I had to manually
01:48 - painstakingly create the entire
01:50 - structure one by one knowing about this
01:52 - awesome visual studio feature would have
01:53 - definitely saved me a ton of time so
01:55 - hopefully this quick video helps someone
01:57 - and another quick mention C also has the
01:59 - Dynamic keyword so one alternative is if
02:03 - you're using json.net you can do it just
02:05 - like this all right hope that's useful
02:07 - check out these videos to learn some
