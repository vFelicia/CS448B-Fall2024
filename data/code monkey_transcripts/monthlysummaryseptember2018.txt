00:00 - hello and welcome I am your code monkey
00:01 - and in this video we're going to review
00:02 - all the videos published in September
00:04 - 2018 let's begin
00:09 - so September started off with a
00:10 - conclusion of the task system in
00:12 - battleground tycoon this series is
00:14 - focused on making a system where you can
00:16 - create tasks to do various things and
00:19 - workers to execute them when possible
00:20 - the video this month can hold the series
00:23 - by creating two different systems
00:25 - working in tandem each system has its
00:27 - own different task types and the workers
00:29 - execute them differently one system is
00:32 - responsible for grabbing items from the
00:34 - floor and placing them in an item slot
00:36 - the other system grabs items from the
00:38 - slots and sends them away each system is
00:40 - completely independent of the other this
00:43 - concludes the task system as is used in
00:45 - battle royale Tycoon I hope you learned
00:48 - something and finally use for it in your
00:49 - own games then there was a very beginner
00:52 - focused video covering what is a
00:54 - component and how it relates to model
00:56 - behavior I've done several beginner
00:58 - focus videos covering the basics of
01:00 - unity so if you're new check out the
01:01 - unity basics playlist also start a new
01:04 - series making spider-man in unity 2d
01:07 - I've been playing the game on a ps4 and
01:09 - it does a lot of things very well so in
01:11 - this series we're going to recreate as
01:13 - much as possible using 2d the series
01:16 - started as much from scratch as possible
01:18 - the only things already prepared were
01:20 - the animations and these sprites so
01:21 - first we have to deal with basic
01:23 - movement and attacks for spider-man then
01:26 - we spawned some enemies and then the
01:28 - ability to attack them once we could
01:30 - attack the enemies when from in the
01:31 - health system to be able to kill them so
01:34 - now the last basic thing we need to add
01:36 - is a simple enemy movement and then we
01:38 - can move on to spider-man specific
01:40 - abilities this series is continuing in
01:43 - October and I'm really looking forward
01:45 - to seeing how many different abilities
01:47 - we can recreate then we had two videos
01:50 - covering saving and loading in different
01:52 - ways first simply saving into a file
01:54 - using our own custom file format this is
01:57 - not necessarily the best approach to
01:58 - take but it teaches you how to separate
02:00 - data then we use JSON which is already a
02:04 - very robust format to store our
02:05 - safehouse the previous month had a video
02:08 - covering what is JSON so in here we
02:10 - simply took the file saving and use JSON
02:13 - to create a very simple but very robust
02:15 - save system we also completed the simple
02:18 - resource gathering a I Series
02:21 - in this series we created from scratch a
02:23 - nice little AI that can gather resources
02:25 - of various types and then use those
02:28 - resources to construct a tower which in
02:30 - turn spawns more gathers it's a great
02:32 - series to watch if you're interested in
02:34 - how you could create a game like Age of
02:36 - Empires so we had a video on resource
02:39 - regeneration so we could grab an
02:41 - infinite amount of resources but with a
02:44 - logic dictating how they would
02:46 - regenerate and in the final video we use
02:49 - the resources gathered to construct a
02:51 - tower after being built the tower spawns
02:53 - and you gather which can be used to
02:54 - gather more resources and so on there
02:57 - was one more video continuing they
02:59 - created where I've series so far in this
03:02 - series we have created a very robust
03:04 - graph that can be easily modified to
03:06 - display any data in this particular
03:08 - video we have some buttons and some code
03:10 - to be able to modify certain parts of
03:12 - our graph like manually change the
03:14 - visual type and string representation
03:16 - then a video on a simple element that is
03:19 - useful in many different game types
03:21 - which is a minimum the first video
03:24 - covered setting up and creating the
03:26 - mini-map we created a camera added the
03:30 - mini-map to the UI with a nice border on
03:32 - top and some icons for the various
03:34 - elements then a second video where we
03:37 - set up several classes to be able to
03:39 - manage our entire mini-map system in
03:40 - several ways through code also two
03:44 - videos on how to create a level by
03:46 - drawing pixels into a texture this is an
03:48 - interesting technique that can be useful
03:50 - depending on how your game is set up the
03:53 - first video covered how to read a
03:54 - texture and read each pixel in that
03:56 - texture and the second video covered how
03:59 - to place different objects depending on
04:01 - the pixel color essentially we draw
04:04 - pixels in a texture and convert those
04:06 - pixels into objects when we unload the
04:08 - unlevel that way we can easily create a
04:11 - lot of different interesting levels by
04:14 - simply drawing several images so that
04:17 - was it for the month of September 2018 I
04:20 - hope you found the video is helpful and
04:22 - learned something along the way if you
04:24 - have any questions regarding any of the
04:26 - videos feel free to post them in the
04:27 - comments and I'll do my best to answer
04:29 - them subscribe for more videos and I'll
04:31 - see you next time
04:43 - you
