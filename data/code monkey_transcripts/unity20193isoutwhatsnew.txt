00:00 - in this video we're going to look at the
00:01 - new features and changes in the in
00:03 - latest version of unity 20 19.3
00:05 - Universal render pipeline terrain homes
00:07 - new editor interface that sample with
00:10 - multiplayer and many many more let's
00:12 - begin ok so unity 20 19.3 has just come
00:21 - out and it contains tons of really
00:22 - interesting new features and especially
00:24 - lots of stuff becoming production-ready
00:26 - first of all the most visible one is the
00:29 - new editor interface as you can see
00:31 - everything has a new flat design
00:32 - honestly at first this new design was
00:34 - pre jarring since I did spend thousands
00:36 - of hours looking at the old editor UI
00:38 - but I've been using the beta version for
00:40 - a couple of weeks and by now it doesn't
00:42 - look normal I do think it looks a bit
00:44 - cleaner with less distracting elements a
00:46 - bunch of 2d tools are now verified
00:48 - packages meaning they are out of preview
00:50 - and become production ready the base
00:53 - thing is studio lights which are now
00:54 - officially supported so they are no
00:56 - longer experimental along with those
00:58 - neon lights also come to these shadows
01:00 - which make your 2d games look great and
01:03 - you can also now efficiently add sub
01:04 - textures so you can set it to the normal
01:06 - maps and masks then there's the 2d
01:09 - animation with all the tooling for
01:10 - creating skeletal animations the two DPS
01:14 - the important which lets you import a
01:15 - Photoshop file and automatically
01:17 - separate layers this is honestly
01:19 - insanely useful especially when you
01:21 - combine it with the 2d skeletal
01:22 - animations then you have to the pixel
01:25 - perfect to the shadowgraph
01:26 - spread shape and town map all of those
01:29 - are now in verified packages as you know
01:31 - I love working in 2d so having more
01:33 - stable 2d features is always excellent
01:35 - news the High Definition render pipeline
01:38 - is out of preview and the own
01:40 - lightweight render pipeline has now been
01:41 - renamed into the universal render
01:43 - pipeline with the u RP also comes the e
01:46 - to the renderer fully supported
01:47 - previously it was in experimental and
01:49 - now everything should work great so that
01:51 - includes official shader graph support
01:53 - for 2d there's also a new
01:55 - post-processing built directly into U R
01:58 - P so this replaced the separate
01:59 - post-processing v2 package although
02:02 - functionally everything should still
02:03 - work the same but be more performant you
02:05 - simply don't need to install a separate
02:07 - package I've used post-processing before
02:09 - but I've never done a video on it so now
02:11 - that we have a different new tool let me
02:13 - know if this is
02:14 - something you'd like to see a basic
02:15 - getting started video and the long with
02:18 - the release of H ERP also comes
02:19 - retracing in preview so that's quite
02:21 - interesting another one out of preview
02:24 - is the VFX graph so this is excellent
02:26 - news and certainly something I plan on
02:28 - covering in the future I've seen a lots
02:30 - of great stuff done in the VFX raft but
02:32 - I've never really used it I've been
02:34 - really enjoying making all the
02:35 - graph tutorials so now playing around
02:37 - with thousands or even millions of
02:39 - particles should be lots of fun how it
02:41 - works is similar to shadow graph so I'm
02:43 - hoping the learning curve isn't too
02:45 - steep the terrain system is also getting
02:47 - some terrain holes this is not something
02:49 - I have ever used but from what I know
02:51 - this is a highly requested feature so
02:52 - it's great to hear let me know if you'd
02:54 - like to see me do some terrain videos I
02:56 - certainly would like to try them for
02:58 - myself the incremental garbage collector
03:01 - is now production ready this is
03:03 - potentially a great new feature that I
03:05 - have yet to try it out essentially if
03:07 - your game is generating garbage then at
03:09 - some point you will know the same
03:10 - massive prawns dip in a single frame
03:12 - that's the garbage being collected it
03:14 - gets on bundled together and then
03:16 - everything gets cleared in a single
03:17 - frame with the incremental GC you should
03:19 - see unless of those massive spikes and
03:21 - more tiny collections we should help
03:23 - your game stay more stable now there's a
03:25 - bunch of new options when entering play
03:27 - mode you can set it to enter without
03:29 - domain reload meaning if you don't
03:31 - modify your scripts you can get into
03:33 - play mode pretty much in an instant this
03:35 - is really excellent for speeding up
03:36 - iteration time so you make a change hit
03:38 - play mode and you're instantly in the
03:40 - game rather than having to wait multiple
03:41 - seconds for the scene to compile this
03:43 - looks like an excellent feature to
03:45 - really speed up iteration but there are
03:47 - some caveats like for example you need
03:48 - to handle reloading you're screwed to
03:50 - yourself so this is a very interesting
03:51 - topic that I definitely want to research
03:53 - also something extremely important is a
03:56 - change in the unity 2020 release cycle a
03:58 - couple of years ago with unity change
04:01 - from one massive new version to three
04:03 - tech releases and one LTS release tech
04:06 - is where new features get added and LTS
04:08 - stands for the long term support where
04:10 - it only contains bug fixes so if you
04:12 - want stability stick with the latest
04:14 - LTS version which right now is 2018
04:16 - point for the change is in 2020 instead
04:19 - of three tech releases like now there
04:21 - won't only be two so 2020 point one
04:24 - should come out in spring with 2020
04:26 - point two
04:26 - coming out in the fall and finally 2020
04:28 - LTS coming out early next year
04:30 - one of the reasons for this change is
04:32 - because now all of new features are
04:34 - being worked on as packages in the 2020
04:37 - release there won't only be two main
04:38 - tech releases but again all the packages
04:41 - won't continue getting releases as
04:42 - they're ready so for example the
04:44 - entities package was just updated to 0.5
04:46 - a couple of days ago entities and the
04:48 - entire dot stack are being developed at
04:50 - full speed and I believe the target is
04:52 - still to get the core ready out by 2020
04:54 - point one the feature of dots continues
04:56 - to be very exciting and something I
04:58 - intend to continue covering so related
05:00 - to that they knew that sample has also
05:02 - come out this is a fully working
05:04 - multiplayer third-person shooter it
05:06 - definitely looks very interesting so
05:08 - it's something I plan to research to
05:09 - figure out how it actually works I
05:11 - especially want to look into the dots
05:13 - netcode present in this sample I've read
05:15 - lots of comments asking for multiplayer
05:17 - content so I might actually prioritize
05:19 - them dots lifelink
05:21 - is another potentially very interesting
05:23 - feature since dots is all about data
05:25 - this lets you easily sync data between
05:26 - devices so that's another thing that is
05:29 - extremely useful for a quick iteration
05:31 - cycle there's also the entity conversion
05:33 - workflow I'll have to look into it but I
05:36 - believe this is the inspector update
05:37 - where you can see what components your
05:39 - game object will be converted into
05:40 - another package also moving along is
05:43 - visual scripting it's still in the
05:44 - experiment on stage but it seems to be
05:46 - coming along nicely there should be a
05:48 - new drop just around the corner and when
05:50 - that comes I want to look at it again
05:51 - and possibly make a small complete game
05:53 - just using visual scripting and beyond
05:56 - that there are tons more new features
05:57 - and improvements that I don't have time
05:59 - to cover here so check the official page
06:01 - to see everything new there's the mobile
06:03 - device simulator there's unity as a
06:05 - library which lets you insert unity
06:07 - directly into native apps the input
06:10 - system continues getting developed quick
06:12 - search in the editor the address of an
06:14 - asset system for referencing offline and
06:17 - online assets the serialized reference
06:19 - attribute profiler improvements UI
06:22 - elements and the UI builder several AR
06:25 - and VR improvements and many many more
06:27 - again check the official page to see
06:29 - everything new in this version this
06:32 - video is made possible thanks to these
06:33 - awesome supporters go to
06:35 - patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to
06:37 - get some perks and help keep the videos
06:39 - free for everyone
06:40 - so that's the long-awaited unity 29.3
06:43 - version as always unity continues to
06:45 - improve with every release and tons of
06:47 - new features coming out with others
06:49 - becoming more and more stable I'm really
06:51 - excited for the future and I can see how
06:52 - unity is currently right in the middle
06:54 - of restructuring everything so you got
06:56 - the new release schedule you got the
06:58 - package manager and you got dots so by
07:00 - now I can definitely see where they're
07:01 - going with and how the next few years
07:03 - are guaranteed to be extremely exciting
07:05 - so go ahead and download 20 19.3 from
07:09 - your unity how I'm going to go ahead and
07:11 - research all of this awesome stuff all
07:13 - right I'll see you next time
