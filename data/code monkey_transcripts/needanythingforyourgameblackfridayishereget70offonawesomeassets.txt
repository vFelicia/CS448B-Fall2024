00:49 - so let's check out some of the helmets
00:51 - on sale all of these assets are
00:53 - excellent there's lots of tools and
00:55 - visuals I'm sure at least some of these
00:56 - won't be super useful for whatever
00:58 - project you're currently working on
01:00 - let's start off by looking at the first
01:01 - batch of Flash Deals I think there are
01:03 - about 14 hours left by the time this
01:05 - video goes live starting off with an
01:07 - excellent Cynthia low poly pack the
01:09 - apocalypse pack as you might know I just
01:11 - recently officially announced my next
01:12 - steam game total warm Liberation that
01:15 - game is all about a zombie
01:16 - post-apocalypse so this asset is one of
01:18 - the main ones that I'm using it's a
01:20 - massive pack with tons of characters
01:21 - buildings and lots of props with the 70
01:24 - flash deal it becomes pretty cheap
01:26 - another great flash deal today is the
01:28 - flat kit it's a really nice tune Shader
01:31 - I experimented with some tune shaders
01:33 - for my game I tried out this one
01:35 - although I ended up choosing a different
01:36 - look this is one of the best tune
01:38 - shaders on the store so if you want to
01:40 - make your game Stand Out definitely get
01:41 - it with the flash deal alternatively
01:43 - another interesting one is quickly I
01:46 - tried this one out a while ago and does
01:47 - produce some great results also features
01:50 - tons of options and settings so you can
01:51 - get it looking exactly as you wanted and
01:53 - another flash deal today is the World
01:55 - building bundle this one is a massive
01:57 - bundle with tons of World building tools
01:59 - including guy and many more
02:01 - there are some extremely capable complex
02:03 - tools for example Gaia can help you make
02:05 - gorgeous worlds in hours instead of
02:07 - months it really is a tool that I'd like
02:09 - to research in more detail extremely
02:11 - powerful and this bundle also includes a
02:13 - level ability tool a world streaming
02:15 - tool cutscene fly through and some
02:17 - interactive soundscapes so pretty much
02:19 - everything you need to build an awesome
02:20 - world for your games on the store Page
02:22 - you can also view all of the assets that
02:24 - won't be live in future flash deals so
02:26 - that means you don't have to wait until
02:27 - the very last day of the cell to pick
02:29 - something up if it's on this list then
02:31 - wait until that day to pick it up but if
02:32 - it's not you can pick it up right away
02:34 - there are some really awesome ones that
02:36 - won't be getting a flash deal
02:37 - for example tomorrow you've got the RPG
02:39 - essential kit this includes the
02:41 - award-winning RPG Builder asset along
02:43 - with tons of visuals weapons armor and
02:45 - characters if you want to build an RPG
02:47 - with a game builder asset then this one
02:49 - is without the best one if instead you
02:51 - prefer a realistic fantasy style then in
02:53 - two days you have this nice Infinity PBR
02:55 - pack one great thing about these assets
02:57 - from Infinity PBR is they always include
02:59 - tons of blunt shapes so you have lots of
03:02 - Sliders to change pretty much anything
03:03 - in all of these units you can modify the
03:05 - face body remove armor change the weapon
03:08 - and so on then if you need textures then
03:10 - over here is a really huge pack with 600
03:12 - textures then in four days there's a
03:15 - really nice home designer pack if you
03:17 - want to make game like The Sims and this
03:18 - seems pretty interesting then you've got
03:20 - some cute robots in seven days a MMORPG
03:23 - game builder if you like fighting games
03:25 - then this Universal fighting engine
03:27 - looks really awesome
03:28 - so as you can see tons of flashlights
03:30 - coming up they refresh every single day
03:32 - so make sure you check out this entire
03:34 - page it has five pages worth of Flash
03:36 - Deals all the way up until December
03:37 - outside of that some of the assets that
03:39 - I covered in my asset review series are
03:41 - currently discounted there is the a-star
03:43 - pathfinding project I've used this asset
03:45 - in pretty much all of my scene games
03:46 - it's insanely fast pathfinding helping
03:49 - you to create games with thousands of
03:51 - units all of them pathfinding around
03:52 - large worlds it also has many map types
03:55 - so you can have a Nev mesh or a grid map
03:57 - or just a simple Point map if you want
03:59 - more control over where the player can
04:01 - move you can check out my phone review
04:03 - to see what it does and how it all works
04:05 - another one that I've also reviewed is
04:07 - rayfire it's an excellent destruction
04:09 - tool the results really speak for
04:11 - themselves it works in runtime and is
04:13 - also externally performant this is one
04:15 - of those things where you can use it to
04:16 - build an entire game around it or you
04:18 - can just add that extra bit of Polish to
04:20 - your game destroying everything really
04:22 - feels quite satisfying then the
04:24 - excellent Odin inspector is also on sale
04:26 - most of you probably already have this
04:28 - one if not not then this is a tool for
04:30 - helping you build tools so depending on
04:32 - how you use it it can be a massive
04:34 - multiplier on your own productivity you
04:36 - can watch my phone review to see a quick
04:37 - getting started guide and see just how
04:39 - easy it is to make your own tools if
04:41 - you're making a 2d game then I can
04:42 - highly recommend the all-in-one spray
04:44 - Shader super easy to add tons of effects
04:47 - to your game also made a review on this
04:48 - one and there's another one by the same
04:50 - developer the all-in-one VFX toolkit I
04:53 - haven't yet looked into this one but it
04:54 - doesn't look really excellent and it's
04:56 - actually pretty cheap the last one that
04:57 - I also reviewed is feel this one is an
05:00 - excellent tool for helping you add
05:01 - polish your games like I've said many
05:03 - times polish is what separates good
05:05 - games from great games if you want to
05:07 - find success you need to make your game
05:09 - stand out so definitely do spend some
05:11 - time polishing it feel is an excellent
05:13 - tool for helping you do exactly that and
05:15 - speaking of Polish one thing you can do
05:17 - to punish your game is use a custom
05:19 - cursor if you want to do that then my
05:21 - own asset the mouse cursor system Pro is
05:23 - really easy to use although Suddenly
05:25 - It's actually not part of the main Black
05:27 - Friday sale these sales are invite only
05:29 - and since the asset hasn't sold much it
05:31 - hasn't been invited to the sale but
05:32 - there's actually another sale happening
05:34 - at the same time as this one the 11-11
05:36 - sale and yes it is part of that sale
05:39 - however that one seems limited to only a
05:41 - handful of countries so depending on
05:42 - which country you're from it might or
05:44 - might not be at sale obviously I'm
05:46 - biased because it's my own asset but I
05:47 - do think that it's great and adding a
05:49 - custom cursor really adds a nice bit of
05:51 - extra polish I will certainly be using
05:53 - it in my own game just before release
05:54 - now some more interesting things on sale
05:56 - you have zebra and liquids if you want
05:59 - to simulate some liquids then this looks
06:01 - excellent liquid simulation is one of
06:03 - those things that is extremely difficult
06:04 - to do in a nice performance manner so
06:06 - picking up a tool like this one is
06:08 - definitely worth it if all you wanted
06:10 - some visuals then there's tons of
06:11 - gorgeous stuff on sale lots of the
06:13 - synthes are on sale if you're a fan of
06:15 - their Style just like me then definitely
06:17 - browse around for some animations here
06:19 - is a runner animation pack really quite
06:21 - a lot of insane animations great if
06:23 - you're making some kind of Parkour game
06:24 - if you want to pack with tons of
06:26 - animations using tons of weapons and
06:28 - this one is great I picked this one up a
06:30 - few years ago and it's quite impressive
06:31 - how many animations it has here is one
06:33 - with some really powerful Archer
06:35 - animations this dev has some really
06:37 - impressive packs for some spread effects
06:39 - here's a pack with tons of Sword slashes
06:41 - fire water and a bunch more if you want
06:43 - it in 3D there's a bunch of gorgeous
06:44 - looking ones like like this one one
06:46 - super easy way of drastically improving
06:48 - your game is changing the Skybox so
06:50 - having a great pack like this one
06:51 - definitely helps another way to
06:53 - instantly improve your game is using a
06:55 - proper UI pack instead of just some
06:56 - basic swear so something like this one
06:58 - if your game has tons of graphs and a
07:00 - proper student can be really useful for
07:02 - example here is graphing chart this one
07:04 - helps you make line graphs bar charts
07:06 - you can make pie charts interact with
07:08 - them and so on if you want to modify and
07:11 - manipulate your meshes then look at mega
07:13 - fires it can help you make some really
07:15 - strange results this one wouldn't look
07:17 - perfect in pretty much any kind of
07:18 - cartoony game shapes is also another
07:20 - great one also on sale it's a great tool
07:23 - for helping you create all kinds of
07:24 - shapes and easily animate them the
07:26 - results look really nice if you're
07:28 - making mobile games and there's also a
07:30 - bunch of us that have some useful tools
07:32 - for example here is easy Mobile Pro it
07:34 - helps you add ads in-app purchases you
07:37 - can trigger notifications game Services
07:38 - sharing and a bunch more another asset
07:41 - that I'm also using in my own Sim game
07:42 - is volumetric lights just in case you
07:45 - don't know volumetrical lights are how
07:46 - you can add an actual shape to the light
07:48 - if you just create a light in unity it
07:51 - won't just eliminate the target area it
07:53 - won't have a visible shaft this tool
07:55 - helps you easily add that you just
07:56 - attach the component play with the
07:58 - settings and that's it really nice and
08:00 - it definitely helped my game trailer
08:01 - look quite a lot better if you want to
08:03 - paint on top of your 3D objects and look
08:05 - at paint 3D it does examine what you
08:07 - expect so this could be useful in a game
08:09 - where you want the player to paint their
08:11 - own objects like for example perhaps
08:12 - adding decals to a car when making some
08:15 - gorgeous games using big lighting is
08:17 - usually the best approach and one asset
08:19 - that I've seen recommended time and time
08:21 - again is Bakery I haven't used it myself
08:23 - but the results definitely look
08:24 - impressive if you want maximum Fidelity
08:27 - then big lighting is the way to go if
08:29 - you want to make platformer games then
08:31 - the Corgi engine is one of the best
08:32 - reviewed assets on the store it's been
08:35 - around for ages and is constantly
08:36 - getting tons of awesome updates
08:38 - something else that also used in the
08:40 - making of my game trailer is some music
08:41 - and sound effects I just browse my asset
08:44 - list and found that I had this really
08:45 - awesome pack it has music and tons and
08:48 - tons of sound effects really useful to
