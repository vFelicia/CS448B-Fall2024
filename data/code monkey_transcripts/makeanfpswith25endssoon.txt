01:06 - very important ones so that's always a
01:08 - nice bonus the bundle contains assets
01:10 - but also two interesting games verdun
01:12 - and tenenberg these are great world war
01:15 - one shooters and verdan also has some
01:17 - really interesting mechanics which i
01:19 - actually remade in another video go
01:21 - watch that video if you haven't seen it
01:22 - yet i really like making these how it's
01:24 - made videos recreating some interesting
01:26 - mechanics but for some reason those
01:28 - videos don't do very well
01:30 - so if you haven't seen it definitely
01:31 - give it a try one more quick thing this
01:33 - friday on the 24th i won't be
01:35 - participating in the official unity and
01:37 - live stream we're going to check out
01:38 - some of these assets we're going to
01:40 - place them for done and i will be
01:41 - answering questions from chat so if you
01:43 - like live streams come check it out okay
01:45 - so let's inspect some of these assets to
01:47 - see what they do and what they'll look
01:48 - like there's timestamps in the video if
01:50 - you want to skip ahead to a particular
01:52 - asset or tone the main one for this pack
01:55 - is the ultimate fps this is a very
01:57 - advanced tool for very easily creating
01:59 - an fps game it's got an excellent demo
02:02 - scene so let's look at it so here it is
02:04 - right away there's some text up top it
02:06 - guides you through everything that the
02:08 - asset can do so right away we can walk
02:10 - around move around jump
02:12 - then you see a weapon right away so just
02:14 - move it and pick it up there you go some
02:16 - nice weapon animations the weapon also
02:18 - has a really nice zoom and of course you
02:20 - can shoot so just fire and yep you can
02:23 - aim anywhere there's some bot particles
02:24 - some decals all of it looking pretty
02:26 - great then this controller is also
02:28 - physics based so you can interact with
02:30 - other physical objects there's even some
02:32 - exploring crates
02:34 - you can pick up a bunch of other weapons
02:36 - like some pistols some other rifles a
02:38 - shotgun some other things
02:40 - this also has some magic abilities so
02:43 - you can fire some fireballs
02:45 - a bunch of particles
02:47 - nice healing effect just want a nice
02:49 - shield to defend from bullets yeah there
02:51 - you go so lots of versatility
02:53 - it also includes an interaction system
02:55 - so you can touch all kinds of buttons
02:58 - you can open up a bunch of crates
03:01 - and also go through the doors so just
03:02 - interact open the door or play an entire
03:04 - animation of actually moving through the
03:06 - door and then back to controlling
03:08 - as you can see there's tons and tons of
03:10 - things you can do with this asset all of
03:12 - it included and it's a really nice
03:13 - starting point how you add it on to a
03:15 - scene is also super simple it comes with
03:18 - a really nice main menu so there you go
03:21 - it's got an entire window you can't just
03:23 - go into the character make a new
03:24 - character and just disable the animator
03:26 - to go with the simplest thing possible
03:28 - just build character
03:29 - and yep there it is right away just like
03:31 - that just with a single click you've got
03:33 - a fully functioning first person
03:35 - character so as you can see this one is
03:36 - really capable of lots of features
03:38 - it's a really complex zoom so that can
03:40 - really help you to quickly get an fps up
03:42 - and running but being so complex does
03:45 - mean that it does have a learning curve
03:47 - now thankfully they do have some
03:48 - excellent documentation including
03:50 - step-by-step video tutorials so if you
03:52 - take the time to learn how to use this
03:53 - tool you'll certainly get a lot out of
03:55 - it
03:56 - now for me i actually prefer smaller
03:58 - assets that do just one single thing and
04:00 - for that the character movement
04:01 - fundamentals is perfect it's a very easy
04:04 - to use and extremely capable character
04:05 - controller now moving a character is
04:08 - something you don't really think too
04:09 - much about but it actually has quite a
04:11 - lot of complexity
04:12 - if you've got to answer the questions
04:14 - like how does your character handle
04:15 - steps slopes terrain moving platforms
04:18 - physics and so on
04:19 - so this asset handles all that
04:22 - so here is the demo scene where you can
04:24 - see all kinds of different obstacles and
04:26 - also this one works in first person but
04:28 - also in third person
04:30 - so for example making a custom gravity
04:32 - so you can go in and yep the character
04:34 - is always like that
04:36 - so this is pretty tricky for you to make
04:37 - but over here you get it out of the box
04:40 - then moving platforms also something
04:42 - that if you try to do you've probably
04:43 - encountered lots of issues with it so
04:45 - once again very easy
04:47 - then of course it works on all kinds of
04:48 - terrain so going up and as you can see
04:50 - everything is really nice and smooth
04:52 - same thing for going up any kind of
04:53 - slopes any kind of stairs the character
04:55 - is really smooth and it perfectly
04:56 - matches all the terrain
04:58 - and if you want to make some puzzle
05:00 - games then this one also has some
05:02 - inversion of gravity so you can flip it
05:03 - around and make something really truly
05:05 - very strange
05:07 - so personally i would say this is
05:08 - probably my favorite asset from the
05:09 - bundle i never like having to deal with
05:12 - all of the edge case when it comes to
05:13 - character controllers so for me the
05:15 - bundle is worth it just for this one
05:17 - then for tons of super high-end
05:18 - characters you have the sci-fi
05:20 - characters mega pack
05:21 - the wrong price for this one is 250
05:24 - dollars so again if you want just a
05:26 - single thing then the whole bundle is a
05:27 - great deal these are some great looking
05:29 - characters and they're all animated so
05:32 - they range from some normal looking
05:33 - humanoid space characters then you also
05:36 - got some very weird very strange
05:38 - monsters
05:39 - then you've got some super giant bosses
05:41 - perfect for making a couple of boss
05:43 - fights so look down really huge really
05:45 - strange
05:47 - and then with this being sci-fi you also
05:48 - have a whole bunch of mechs so look at
05:51 - all these
05:52 - look at all that looking really great
05:54 - and according to the description on the
05:56 - essence or they are continuously adding
05:58 - more and more characters to this pack
05:59 - and there's 10 more to come if you just
06:01 - want some animated weapons then this
06:03 - pack is also great
06:05 - so you've got everything from a bunch of
06:06 - rifles some uzi some shotguns some
06:08 - pistols even some melee weapons some
06:10 - grenades and so on
06:12 - all these are perfect for making a first
06:14 - person game
06:15 - and they come with all sorts of
06:17 - animations as well as a bunch of really
06:19 - nice scopes and attachments so you could
06:21 - easily combine any of these with either
06:23 - the character controller asset or use it
06:25 - with the ufps asset
06:27 - if those weapons are too realistic and
06:29 - you want some more sci-fi weapons
06:30 - there's another pack with a whole bunch
06:32 - of them
06:32 - for a super useful effect you have
06:35 - highlight plus so it does exactly what
06:37 - you expect it lets you very easily add
06:39 - some highlights to pretty much any
06:41 - object so this would be great for
06:43 - highlighting some weapons or maybe a
06:45 - weapon that you can pick up or pretty
06:47 - much anything that you want the player
06:48 - to see another useful tool is the pro
06:51 - tips tooltip system it's really advanced
06:53 - very versatile if your game has tons of
06:56 - items or weapons or skills then this
06:57 - would be a great addition you can use it
06:59 - with any style you want display any text
07:01 - or images and it's always on screen so
07:03 - no issue with the tooltip being hidden
07:05 - for some environments you have the
07:07 - seascape city system this one lets you
07:09 - easily generate a pretty convincing city
07:11 - with just a single click so if you want
07:13 - to quickly make a gtm-like prototype
07:16 - then this would be a great starting
07:17 - point for building your world it builds
07:19 - roads and all kinds of buildings the
07:21 - buildings themselves also look pretty
07:23 - great they even have a window shader
07:25 - with fake parallax interiors and you've
07:27 - got lots and lots of settings for
07:28 - changing pretty much anything for other
07:31 - environments you have the
07:32 - post-apocalyptic world pack
07:34 - so the asset page for this one says that
07:36 - it's inspired by the last of us and that
07:38 - definitely makes sense it looks pretty
07:40 - great and of course this is a whole demo
07:42 - scene and all this is composed of tons
07:44 - of different unique objects so you can
07:45 - easily just take them apart and build
07:47 - your own unique scene and if you have a
07:49 - training area in your game then you can
07:51 - use these shooting range interiors so
07:53 - lots of games have place where you can
07:54 - test out your weapons and this would be
07:56 - the perfect place for it if instead of
07:58 - fps you want to make a third person
08:00 - shooter then the bundle also includes an
08:01 - excellent asset just for that based on
08:03 - the demo scene looks really capable so
08:05 - you've got lots of locomotion actions
08:07 - the character controller handles all
08:09 - kinds of terrain it features third
08:10 - person shooting some ragdolls ramps
08:12 - hazards and accurate foot placement also
08:15 - it even has vehicle support so you can
08:17 - go inside and drive a bike or a car
08:19 - looks really awesome and there's even
08:21 - more awesome stuff in the bummer
08:23 - so for example you've got a ui pack lots
08:25 - of ui elements of course tons of sound
08:28 - effects music and so on
08:30 - you also have a really complex ai system
08:33 - then a physics interaction system a
08:35 - bunch of sci-fi props
08:37 - you even have a multiplayer shooter
08:38 - template have some sensors to identify a
08:41 - bunch of things
08:42 - and of course the two games that i
08:43 - mentioned so as you can see there's tons
08:46 - of awesome stuff that you can get for a
08:47 - very low price like i said if just a
08:49 - single one of these looks interesting
08:50 - then the home bundle is worth it this is
08:52 - a pretty quick deal i'm actually a bit
08:54 - late to making this video it ends just
08:56 - next week so if you're interested
08:57 - definitely go ahead and get it now and
08:59 - like i mentioned the bundle also
09:00 - includes those two games so go play some
09:02 - for done and then go watch my video on
09:04 - remaking some interesting mechanics from
09:06 - it and don't forget if you like live
09:08 - streams come and join me this friday on
