00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - over my 25 years of writing code and 10
00:04 - years of making games have developed a
00:05 - really nice ability the ability and
00:07 - confidence to be able to build any game
00:08 - that I can imagine I've made action
00:10 - games I've made management games and
00:13 - strategy games I've made automation
00:15 - games racing games Platformers I've even
00:18 - made casual games I've made top down
00:20 - Shooters made a turnbas strategy game a
00:22 - tower defense game I've made firstperson
00:25 - Shooters a battle Sandbox game Park
00:27 - simulation game Logistics management
00:29 - game game a co-op game and tons more
00:32 - mini games and prototypes building all
00:34 - of this has really granted me the
00:35 - confidence and the ability that I am
00:37 - capable of building any game that I can
00:38 - imagine this is a really nice ability to
00:40 - have and I'm sure a lot of you would
00:41 - like to have this as well basically my
00:43 - goal with this Channel with the tons of
00:44 - tutorials that I've done with all the
00:46 - course that I've created the goal with
00:47 - all this is really for me to pass on
00:48 - this ability onto you so you can make
00:50 - any game you can imagine however don't
00:52 - get me wrong I'm not saying this brag
00:53 - quite the opposite actually it did not
00:55 - Ed to be like this for me in fact for my
00:57 - very first team game what eventually
00:59 - became Survivor Squad this is a top-
01:01 - down strategy zombie game so you recruit
01:03 - a bunch of survivors gather four
01:04 - supplies and weapons move around as a
01:06 - squad and survive all these zombies
01:08 - however the initial idea was not a
01:10 - zombie game one of my favorite games as
01:11 - a kid was SWAT I played a ton of Swat 2
01:14 - and SWAT 3 I really love these games all
01:16 - of the idea of scouting and building
01:17 - from the outside getting all the squad
01:19 - members up against the door doing a
01:21 - breach and taking down all the bad guys
01:22 - in a really satisfying manner so when I
01:24 - was thinking of ideas for what to do for
01:26 - my first team game this is the idea that
01:27 - came to mind right away that was the
01:29 - plan that's what I want to do I basally
01:30 - wanted to make a top down SWAT game
01:32 - however back then I was much less
01:33 - experienced than I am nowadays this was
01:35 - 12 years ago all the way back in 2012 as
01:37 - I was trying to make this idea come to
01:39 - life is I was trying to write all the a
01:41 - logic control of the units getting them
01:43 - all to stack up against the door and all
01:45 - do some basic common logic doing all of
01:47 - that while also having the enemies react
01:49 - intelligently to the SWAT units I was
01:50 - really trying to build all that but it
01:52 - was a really very frustrating experience
01:54 - my code was a complete mess and all that
01:55 - logic just did not work together so
01:58 - after trying for a really really long
01:59 - time eventually had to face reality that
02:01 - I wasn't yet skilled enough to bring
02:02 - that Vision to life I tried my hardest
02:04 - but I just couldn't build it so at that
02:05 - point I decided to give up on the idea
02:07 - of making a SWAT game which would
02:09 - involve some very complex Ai and instead
02:11 - I changed it to be a game all about
02:12 - zombies zombies are really dumb so
02:14 - there's really not much AI required they
02:16 - really just move towards the Target and
02:17 - attack that's it with my skills at the
02:19 - time I was capable of doing that kind of
02:21 - dumb zombie Ai and for the same reason I
02:22 - also scra the idea of having the units
02:24 - all Bunch up together and do some
02:25 - complex breaching logic again I really
02:27 - couldn't make that happen so I made the
02:29 - units just manually controlled by the
02:31 - player so the player has to manually
02:32 - control each one individually that was
02:34 - my reality back then I wish I was able
02:36 - to bring the original Vision to life but
02:38 - back then I did not have the skills that
02:39 - I have today I did not have the ability
02:41 - to bring any game I can imagine to life
02:43 - whereas nowadays after 12 years of
02:45 - building tons of games and writing tons
02:47 - and tons of lines of code nowadays I am
02:49 - confident I have that ability nowadays I
02:51 - am confident that if I went back to that
02:52 - original idea with all the logic of
02:54 - doing the AI breaching with all the AI
02:56 - for the enemies and all that nowadays I
02:58 - am confident that I could build the
02:59 - exactly as I envisioned it 12 years ago
03:01 - so basically here on this channel I
03:03 - imagine some of you are myself from that
03:04 - time ago and I want to help pass on dis
03:06 - ability onto you so you can build any
03:08 - game you can imagine and also hopefully
03:10 - I can pass on disability onto you
03:11 - without taking as long as it took me
03:13 - nowadays for making a my main limitation
03:15 - isn't lack of ability but rather just
03:16 - time some of my favorite games growing
03:18 - up were also Age of Empires red Earth
03:21 - Empire Earth and later on generals and
03:23 - Company of Heroes I would absolutely
03:24 - love to do some kind of RTS someday then
03:26 - there are tons of really interesting
03:28 - Simulator games on Steam is also a genre
03:30 - that I'd love to tackle someday or
03:32 - actually one that I've had on my two
03:33 - playlist for ages but still haven't
03:35 - gotten around to it something like sardy
03:37 - Valley I haven't played it just because
03:38 - I know that as soon as I touch it I'm
03:40 - going to be obsessed with the game and
03:41 - I'm going to play non-stop for about 100
03:43 - hours and whilst I'm playing I'm also
03:44 - going to be thinking about all kinds of
03:46 - videos all kinds of systems that I'd
03:47 - love to remake from this game another
03:49 - favorite game of mine while growing up
03:50 - was The Sims back then I played it kind
03:52 - of like an RPG my goal was always to
03:54 - start with a Sim with no money and then
03:56 - pick a random career and work all the
03:58 - way to the top I remember how keeping a
04:00 - certain number of friends for getting
04:01 - each promotion that was really tricky
04:03 - part making a life simulation game like
04:04 - this one sounds like a lot of fun
04:06 - there's also a bunch of building
04:07 - crafting combat games on Steam kind of
04:09 - like valheim I'd also love to build one
04:11 - of these games someday or another one
04:12 - that I also loved was Max Bane I'd love
04:14 - to build some kind of third person
04:15 - shooter with some really awesome bullet
04:17 - time mechanics out of all of those I am
04:19 - confident that I do have the ability to
04:20 - bring any of these to life now obviously
04:22 - when I'm saying that I am keeping in
04:23 - mind scope for example a game like the
04:25 - Sims 4 this one has a Monumental scope
04:28 - there's literally tens of thousands of
04:29 - objects and interactions the game has
04:31 - almost 1,000 bucks worth of DLC so yeah
04:34 - obviously it's not possible for me or
04:35 - any experience developer any Soul
04:37 - developer to build the game on this
04:38 - scale but something with a much smaller
04:40 - scope like the first Sims something that
04:42 - just focuses on the core game mechanics
04:44 - yeah that one I'm pretty confident that
04:45 - I could build but at the same time also
04:47 - another Point there's a big difference
04:48 - between being able to technically make
04:50 - some kind of game and making an
04:52 - excellent game games are a combination
04:53 - of Art and technology so it's not just
04:55 - Tech this is why the discipline of game
04:57 - design that one is more of an art as
04:59 - opposed to a science
05:00 - so whilst I could technically build all
05:01 - these games I'm not sure I could get the
05:03 - excellent game design behind them but
05:04 - just being able to build something
05:06 - technically that is a pretty awesome
05:07 - ability and if you want to also develop
05:09 - this ability the ability of being able
05:10 - to take any game idea you have in your
05:12 - mind and bring it to life if so then
05:14 - really my best advice is just build tons
05:15 - of things make lots of games and write
05:17 - tons and tons of code like I said in my
05:19 - story about my Survivor Squad game what
05:20 - changed in the 12 years since I made
05:22 - that game what changed was really just
05:24 - the amount of games that I've made the
05:25 - amount of code that I've written since
05:26 - that time I've written literally
05:28 - hundreds of thousands of Ls of code and
05:29 - through all that time and all that
05:30 - experience that is how I was able to
05:32 - acquire this really awesome ability
05:34 - experience truly is a very magical thing
05:36 - the more games you make the more code
05:37 - you write the more capability you become
05:39 - until reach a point where you can build
05:40 - literally anything you can imagine so
05:42 - the answer to attaining disability is
05:44 - really just experience if you are a
05:45 - beginner then I high recommend remaking
05:47 - some super simple games my favorite
05:49 - simple game is Just Flappy Bird it is
05:51 - super simple a very basic design but
05:53 - still teaches you quite a lot pong is
05:55 - also a simple one and also involves some
05:56 - basic AI then for one level above that
05:59 - you can make some like Pac-Man or Space
06:01 - Invaders those involve a little bit more
06:03 - logic or perhaps some quote unquote
06:05 - original simple games you can make
06:07 - something like a super simple platformer
06:09 - literally just a character with gravity
06:11 - jumping over blocks that's it or make a
06:13 - super simple racing game kind of like my
06:15 - own game that I showed where it really
06:17 - just goes left to right and Dodges cars
06:19 - or you can make a simple top down shoot
06:21 - with zombies something super basic with
06:23 - extremely simple AI basically the answer
06:25 - to attaining this ability is experience
06:27 - the more games you make the more code
06:29 - you write the more capable you become
06:30 - you basically just have to make a dozen
06:32 - crappy games before you can make
06:33 - something good so just get those done
06:35 - very quickly in order to gain a ton of
06:37 - experience if you're looking for a guide
06:39 - path you can check out some of the
06:40 - courses where I made some of the games
06:41 - that I mentioned you can see how I built
06:43 - a tower defense game from scratch or how
06:44 - I made this really awesome turn-based
06:46 - strategy game kind of like XCOM this is
06:48 - a really awesome intermediate course or
06:50 - how I made a co-op game in my free
06:51 - kitchen chaos course and the followup
06:53 - multiplayer one or in general check out
06:55 - my recently released C course this one
06:57 - is focused on the language itself which
06:58 - is more General so it allows you to gain
07:00 - knowledge to be able to build any game
07:02 - or really write any code that you can
07:03 - think of I include my 10 years of C
07:05 - knowledge in this course it features
07:07 - over 50 video lectures each covering
07:08 - different topics starting from the
07:10 - absolute Basics to some more complex
07:11 - stuff and of course also importantly
07:13 - includes a companion project this one
07:15 - includes questions quizzes and very
07:16 - importantly it includes over a 100
07:18 - interactive exercis these are exercises
07:20 - that required to actually write code in
07:22 - order to complete the exercise I
07:24 - designed them specifically to help you
07:25 - learn by doing in order to ensure you
07:27 - really truly learn the contents of each
07:28 - lecture either way regardless of what
07:30 - path you choose I wish you the best of
07:31 - luck in your Learning Journey and I hope
07:33 - that one day you to can have the
07:35 - confidence and the ability to be able to
07:36 - build any game you can imagine
