00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your kid monkey so
00:02 - here's a question for you do you have a
00:04 - dream game if so what is your dream game
00:06 - basically what is something that you
00:08 - would build if you had unlimited time
00:09 - and resources this is something that I
00:11 - see quite a lot of people talking about
00:12 - if you search for a dream game on
00:14 - YouTube you won't find a modern videos
00:16 - on people making their dream game some
00:18 - people are making some huge RPGs others
00:20 - are making some survival games or some
00:21 - complex metroidvanias personally I
00:23 - always really enjoy watching these one
00:25 - really nice thing about the Indie Game
00:27 - Dev Community is how everyone is so
00:28 - supportive if you say that you're
00:30 - working on your dream game there won't
00:31 - be lots of people cheering on for you
00:33 - hoping to succeed now for me I'm
00:35 - currently working on my upcoming steam
00:36 - game dinky Guardians it's a really fun
00:38 - Colony building automation defense game
00:40 - I really love working on this game I'm
00:42 - enjoying both developing it and playing
00:43 - it personally I can't wait to finish it
00:45 - and have tons of people employ it and
00:47 - hear what they think although at the
00:48 - same time I would not say this is my
00:50 - dream game now that's not a negative on
00:52 - the game like I said I'm really enjoying
00:53 - working on it this is going to be my
00:55 - ninth steam game I've been making games
00:57 - since 2012 and before that I made 40
00:59 - Flash game games so I've made a ton of
01:01 - games and I've really enjoyed making
01:02 - every single one of these they're all
01:04 - unique and interesting in their own ways
01:06 - the simple reality is I generally don't
01:07 - really have a dream game I don't know if
01:09 - that means that I'm weird I generally do
01:11 - have a mountain of games that I would
01:13 - love to build I just don't have a single
01:15 - one dream game basically if you gave me
01:17 - unlimited time and money there's not a
01:19 - single idea that I would love to build
01:20 - instead there's tons of them that I
01:22 - would love to build I think the
01:24 - difference in this question might also
01:25 - be how some game devs are very artistic
01:27 - people they recently see themselves as
01:29 - artists making a masterpiece whereas for
01:31 - me I've only seen myself as more
01:33 - something like a toy maker the games
01:35 - that I like to make and that I like to
01:36 - play are more focused on systems and
01:37 - mechanics rather than some beautiful
01:39 - stories and characters that's really
01:40 - just my personal preference so really
01:42 - for me I don't have a single thing that
01:44 - I would love to make instead I've got
01:46 - hundreds of mini toys that I would love
01:47 - to build for example last month I was
01:49 - playing Desperado 3. I'd love to one day
01:51 - build a really nice sound strategy game
01:53 - just like that one but again I also
01:55 - wouldn't call that my dream game then
01:56 - next year I'm also planning on returning
01:58 - to the development of my game total
01:59 - world duration that's a game that I put
02:01 - on hate as well I worked on Tiki Gardens
02:03 - I'm also really excited to work on that
02:05 - game making a really nice exxon-like and
02:07 - a persistent horn with some zombies I
02:09 - think that idea sounds really awesome I
02:11 - definitely can't wait to play it but
02:12 - again I wouldn't necessarily combat my
02:13 - dream game I'd also love to one day
02:15 - explore making a survival crafting game
02:17 - something like valheim I'd love to spend
02:19 - some time researching card games and
02:20 - make something like Marvel Snap I've
02:22 - also never done a first person game
02:24 - previously I stuck with 2D games simply
02:26 - because I didn't know where to get 3D
02:28 - models but now that I do know how to use
02:29 - the answer sword and get a bunch of 3D
02:31 - models now I'd love to try something in
02:32 - first person related to that I'd also
02:34 - love to explore VR for a bit then open
02:37 - world games are some of my favorites to
02:39 - play with today's tools it would be
02:40 - possible for you someone would ever like
02:41 - me to make one so yep like I said I
02:43 - don't have a single dream game instead
02:45 - I've got tons of ideas that I would love
02:47 - to build over the course of my entire
02:48 - life I guess it does come back to that
02:50 - artist versus toy maker distinction for
02:53 - example someone like Quentin Tarantino
02:54 - he sees himself as an artist he famously
02:57 - stated in how he only wants to make 10
02:58 - movies and that's it whereas for myself
03:00 - I imagine when I'm 90 years old I really
03:02 - hope to have a portfolio of more than 50
03:04 - games all of them interesting of them
03:05 - unique so when I see all these videos
03:07 - talking about people making their dream
03:09 - game I do wonder if I'm a bit weird or
03:11 - maybe it's simply a case of survivorship
03:12 - bias it's just the fact that if you make
03:15 - a video and you title it by saying
03:16 - you're making your dream game that makes
03:17 - for a more compelling video so naturally
03:19 - those get more views more clicks I made
03:21 - two posts in the comments so use those
03:22 - to vote on whether or not you do have a
03:24 - dream game should be fun to see the
03:26 - results and if it turns out that I'm
03:28 - weird for not having a dream game if
03:29 - most people have one if that's the case
03:31 - then you yourself also don't have a
03:32 - dream game well then at least know that
03:34 - you're not alone because I am the same
03:35 - and even though this is not my dream
03:37 - game I'm really excited for the
03:38 - Guardians the release date is coming
03:40 - soon so go ahead and edit your wish list
03:41 - and stay tuned for the final game
03:42 - alright so thanks for watching and I'll
03:44 - see you next time
04:00 - thank you
