01:20 - some weird particle effects check out
01:22 - this shapes pack really very unique
01:24 - effects very weird it could fit with a
01:27 - sci-fi cyberpunk theme or maybe some
01:29 - fantasy i could see this being great for

02:21 - that check out this asset looks great
02:23 - makes the whole thing have a tint have
02:25 - some distortion some fog like you expect

03:06 - roughness so the materials look really
03:08 - great then a really interesting asset
03:11 - this human anatomy model

03:14 - rather than using a game but it looks
03:16 - great it's a male model with a bunch of
03:19 - anatomically correct layers
03:21 - so it's got the skeleton then on top of

03:40 - the other hand if you're working on a
03:42 - realistic apocalypse game then check out
03:44 - this great looking environment
03:46 - it's great if you're building something
03:48 - sort of in the vein of the last of us

04:20 - some modular pack like the previous one
04:22 - to get even more variety so enable the
04:25 - players to customize the actual weight
04:26 - of your character or maybe just use this
04:29 - as kind of like that effect in the blade
04:30 - movie where the enemies simply expand
04:33 - until they pop if you don't like to make
04:35 - something like roller coasters tycoon
