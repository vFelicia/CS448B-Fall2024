00:12 - tools in the last video i already
00:14 - covered the best free new asset so go
00:15 - watch that if you haven't seen it and in
00:17 - the next one i will be covering the top
00:18 - assets and effects as always there's a
00:20 - link to the ads in the description and
00:21 - as a bonus you can use the coupon code

00:25 - you need some assets there's three sales
00:27 - happening right now there's a sale on
00:29 - the cinti store everything at fifty

00:32 - gorgeous low poly style tons of themes
00:34 - and for the next three days the kids
00:36 - pack is at 70 off and next week is the
00:38 - western fact then on the unity astastor
00:40 - spring sale 500 of the best-selling
00:42 - assets are on sale up to 80 off lots of
00:45 - great stuff including almost everything
00:47 - i've covered in my asset review series
00:49 - and finally there's also a humboldt
00:50 - bundle with a massive pack over 7 000
00:53 - icons for 95 off so if you need anything
00:56 - for whatever game you're currently
00:57 - working on then check out those links
00:59 - alright so starting off with a very
01:01 - interesting hexagon generator easily
01:03 - generate giant hexagon whirls there's a
01:05 - bunch of tiles including some water and
01:08 - it also generates varying height so all
01:10 - of your worlds can have mountains the
01:12 - whole thing works with scriptable
01:13 - objects so everything is really flexible
01:15 - if instead of an entire world you just
01:17 - want to generate a simple room then look
01:19 - at this one personally i really dislike
01:21 - having to manually place all of the
01:23 - props so these tools are always
01:24 - interesting you just define the props
01:27 - and then play around with tons of
01:28 - settings and look at your brand new room
01:30 - if you use some outside props like
01:32 - bushes and trees you can even build a
01:34 - really nice outside environment the
01:36 - results look great and it even works for
01:38 - multi-story buildings then a simple but
01:40 - useful one a auto complete drop down
01:42 - menu
01:43 - works with any text mesh pro field you
01:45 - can add a drop down menu then just start
01:48 - typing and it will show you all the
01:49 - matching objects this was specifically
01:51 - made to handle really big databases
01:53 - whilst being very performant so i can
01:55 - see this as being really useful if your
01:57 - game has tons of items weapons or
01:59 - religious objects of any kind then
02:01 - something else also pretty simple a nice
02:03 - image blur it's a ui element that blurs
02:06 - everything behind it so if you don't
02:08 - like having solid colors in your ui then
02:10 - this one would be a great upgrade it
02:12 - definitely looks much better in the demo
02:14 - and it's really easy to use just add the
02:15 - component and it works super simple
02:18 - then if you want a more complex tool for
02:19 - building terrains look at this one the
02:21 - demo shown in the trailer looks really
02:23 - gorgeous it's got a really high
02:25 - resolution terrain pretty much every
02:26 - short is really gorgeous tons of unique
02:28 - biomes
02:30 - you can easily create stamps and then
02:31 - stamp them on your terrain add some
02:33 - paths for your player to move or maybe
02:35 - just a river it also includes over 50
02:38 - pre-built stamps so for non-artists like
02:40 - me that's really useful up next for
02:42 - something very specific if you have some
02:44 - extremely valuable proprietary source
02:46 - code then a tool like this can make
02:48 - sense it basically obfuscates some of
02:50 - your code making it really hard for
02:52 - anyone to read it so it just turns all
02:54 - the text function names everything into
02:56 - jargon definitely a niche tool they've
02:58 - been building this one for five years so
03:00 - it must be good at what it does if
03:01 - you're looking for a complete game
03:03 - template look at this one it's about
03:04 - making a vehicle factory game there's
03:07 - tons of simple game templates but this
03:08 - one doesn't look quite interesting
03:10 - you basically drag and drop off the
03:12 - various parts to create a vehicle and
03:13 - then use it in a run it's a fun concept
03:16 - and if you want to learn how a system
03:18 - like this would work you can also look
03:19 - at my spaceship builder game then a tool
03:21 - that describes itself as an extreme
03:23 - tracing tool it captures a log of every
03:26 - single thing that happens in your game
03:28 - you can watch it working in real time
03:29 - you can see what called what with what
03:31 - parameters when it happened and so on
03:33 - really tons of detail so if you have
03:35 - issues with debugging then having this
03:37 - much information might be helpful up
03:39 - next if you're working in vr here's a
03:41 - photography kit it's really quite
03:43 - interesting you can basically create
03:45 - your own high-end photography studio
03:47 - directly in vr so you can physically
03:49 - pick up a camera place it anywhere you
03:51 - can grab some lights change with the
03:52 - caller fov and so on pick up a second
03:54 - monitor position your subject and so on
03:57 - so it looks like it would be really fun
03:58 - just to play around this one or you
04:01 - could possibly use it even in a non-vr
04:03 - game just to go inside the game and take
04:05 - some really great screenshots of your
04:06 - models and over here we have another
04:08 - useful tool called asset cleaner like
04:11 - the name implies it helps you clean up
04:12 - your project folder so easily find all
04:15 - the essence that are not being used and
04:16 - purge them with a single click if you're
04:18 - in the habit of importing tons of assets
04:20 - when you just need a single one then
04:22 - this can be quite useful to keep your
04:23 - project from ballooning in size
04:25 - alright so those are my top 10 new tools
04:28 - and systems on the unt assessor for
04:29 - apron 22. there's a link so in the
04:31 - description and as a bonus you can use
04:33 - the coupon code monkey10 to get 10
