00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here's a quick video to help you
00:03 - choose the correct unity version for
00:05 - your project
00:06 - the way versions are set up is actually
00:08 - some quite simple logic but can also be
00:10 - a bit confusing for a beginner so let's
00:12 - see
00:12 - if you want the quick and easy answer
00:14 - just go with the latest lts version
00:16 - but for more detail keep watching the
00:18 - video one quick note here the important
00:20 - takeaway from this video
00:21 - are the categories and what they mean
00:23 - the specific versions that i'm going to
00:24 - mention
00:24 - are just examples but the categories in
00:26 - which they fit is the important part
00:28 - which should still be relevant even if
00:30 - you're watching this many months or
00:31 - years in the future
00:32 - so first let me cover the naming scheme
00:35 - the first part is the year when that
00:36 - version was first released
00:38 - the second part is the major version
00:40 - number then it's the minor version along
00:42 - with the state alpha beta or final
00:45 - at any given point in time there are
00:47 - usually three versions you can choose
00:49 - at the time of this recording you have
00:50 - 2019.4
00:52 - 2020.2 and 2021.2 those fall into three
00:56 - categories
00:56 - you have long term support tech and
00:59 - preview
00:59 - now you might think that the best
01:01 - version to choose is the very last one
01:03 - however that's not exactly right the
01:05 - very last version which as of right now
01:07 - is 2021.2
01:09 - is in the alpha or beta stage meaning
01:12 - that it's potentially unstable
01:13 - so it should only be used if you want to
01:15 - help unity with their beta testing
01:17 - program
01:17 - which by the way they also have some
01:19 - nice prices to give away if you do
01:20 - manage to find a bug
01:22 - so this version represents the future
01:24 - and since it's an alpha or beta
01:26 - version it is potentially unstable after
01:28 - that comes the tech release
01:30 - which as of the time of this recording
01:31 - is 20.2
01:33 - this one is more stable than the alpha
01:35 - or beta versions but still potentially
01:37 - unstable as it is constantly receiving
01:39 - new features and updates
01:41 - this one contains lots of preview
01:42 - packages so that people can test them
01:44 - although again that comes at the cost of
01:46 - potential instability
01:47 - and finally you have the lts version or
01:50 - long term support
01:51 - this is the most stable version possible
01:53 - this version has gone through rigorous
01:55 - extensive testing to ensure everything
01:57 - works perfectly and all of the validated
01:59 - packages work correctly without any
02:01 - issues
02:01 - the only updates this version gets are
02:03 - bug fixes it does not get any new
02:05 - features after it goes into lts
02:08 - unity keeps actively supporting their
02:09 - versions for 2 years after release
02:11 - so you won't find two separate lts
02:13 - versions right now you can use 2019.4
02:16 - lts or 2018.4 lts
02:18 - also one quick note regarding the lts
02:20 - major version number
02:22 - previously unity was making four major
02:24 - releases per year with the last one
02:25 - being the lts version
02:27 - so that is why you have 2018.4 in 2019.4
02:31 - those are the lts versions
02:32 - however last year they switched to only
02:34 - three major releases per year in order
02:36 - to make each release more stable
02:38 - so that means that in a few months when
02:40 - 2020 goes into lts it will be 2020.3 lts
02:44 - so putting all of this together how do
02:45 - you choose a unity version is very
02:47 - simple
02:47 - do you want to help unity with their
02:49 - beta testing program
02:50 - if so then choose the preview version
02:52 - otherwise ask yourself what does your
02:54 - project require
02:55 - does your project absolutely require
02:57 - features which are currently in preview
02:59 - and only available in the tech version
03:01 - so for example is your game dependent on
03:03 - something like unity dots
03:04 - if so then you do need to use the attack
03:06 - version but do ask yourself if you
03:09 - absolutely need those features
03:11 - in the vast majority of cases your game
03:13 - will not be pushing the limits of what
03:14 - is possible so you should be using the
03:16 - lts versions and if there are multiple
03:19 - lts versions available and you're just
03:20 - starting out then simply choose the
03:22 - latest lts version
03:23 - that is why even though we're already in
03:25 - the middle of 2021 i am still using
03:27 - 2019.4 on my projects
03:29 - that's because it's the most stable
03:30 - version and most of the things that i
03:32 - cover are normal things which do not
03:33 - require anything special
03:35 - however as an example i've also done
03:37 - some machine learning videos
03:38 - those are indeed on the bleeding edge so
03:41 - for those i did use 20 20 because that's
03:43 - what the package requires
03:44 - whenever 2020 enters lts then it'll
03:46 - switch into using that version
03:48 - also you can have multiple versions and
03:50 - so on here in the unity hub you can go
03:53 - into install and here you see all of the
03:54 - available versions that i just mentioned
03:57 - and here you can see that i have quite a
03:58 - lot of them installed at the same time
04:00 - and if you have more than one then when
04:02 - you go into create a new project you can
04:04 - click on the arrow icon
04:06 - and this lets you choose specifically
04:07 - which version you want to use to create
04:09 - the new project
04:10 - also somewhat related to the unity
04:11 - version are the package versions so let
04:13 - me quickly mention them as well
04:15 - on the packages you also have three
04:16 - states you have preview
04:18 - released and verified preview packages
04:20 - like the name implies are in active
04:22 - development and should only be used to
04:24 - preview what's coming in the future
04:26 - in order to even see the preview
04:27 - packages you need to go into the options
04:29 - to show the preview packages
04:31 - and if you install any of them you will
04:32 - also see a big button letting you know
04:34 - that you are using preview packages
04:36 - which might be unstable
04:37 - then you have release packages they have
04:39 - gone through preview and are considered
04:41 - stable
04:42 - and after that you have verified
04:44 - packages these are just like the lts
04:46 - versions
04:46 - they have gone through extensive
04:48 - rigorous testing with a specific unity
04:49 - version to ensure maximum stability
04:52 - so when it comes to packages ideally you
04:54 - should be using the verified packages
04:56 - combined with the unity version they
04:57 - were verified for
04:58 - but in my experience the funny release
05:00 - packages are also very stable so don't
05:02 - worry about using those
05:03 - and again the preview packages are only
05:05 - meant for testing and researching the
05:07 - feature of the engine
05:08 - so just to reiterate on how to choose a
05:10 - unity version
05:11 - the alpha or beta versions are meant
05:13 - only for testing
05:14 - if you want to be an active tester then
05:16 - use those but if you just want to make
05:18 - games then don't touch them
05:20 - then comes the tech version if you want
05:21 - to experiment with the bleeding edge of
05:23 - tech and see what the future won't feel
05:24 - like then do use those
05:26 - but again if you just want to make games
05:28 - then don't finally the
05:29 - lts version in 99 of cases this is what
05:33 - you should be using since it won't do
05:34 - everything you want to do and it will
05:36 - have the utmost stability
05:38 - alright hope that helped you understand
05:39 - how unity versions work
