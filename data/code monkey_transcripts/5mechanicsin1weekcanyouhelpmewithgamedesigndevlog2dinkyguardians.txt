00:01 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:03 - crafting machine resource spawn areas a
00:05 - janki y some awesome building capsules
00:07 - heat mechanic and a spawn manager so
00:10 - here's the progress that I made in my
00:11 - game this last week now as you can see
00:13 - this is a new format that I'm trying out
00:14 - so let me know what you think and stick
00:16 - around to the end where I will ask you
00:17 - some design questions that I currently
00:19 - don't have an answer to that's
00:21 - as soon as I finish writing the very
00:22 - first devlog I get back to work on the
00:24 - game as always see challenges combining
00:26 - working on the game and continuing to
00:27 - make regular videos but thankfully this
00:29 - past week things actually went quite
00:31 - well I was still busy with regular
00:32 - videos took some time to edit the
00:34 - previous devlog then I had to get the 22
00:36 - LTS video done and I was also editing a
00:39 - really awesome video for next week but I
00:40 - did manage to work on the game for maybe
00:42 - about 4 days full time so I was able to
00:44 - do quite a bit of work I managed to
00:46 - implement quite a lot of these systems
00:47 - the game is definitely starting to take
00:48 - shape although right now I'm actually
00:50 - working against a pre-strike deadline
00:52 - I've got to get a working build in the
00:54 - game ready by the 10th so that I can
00:55 - have the build reviewed by Steam and
00:57 - ready to go on live for the festival in
00:59 - case you don't know how Sim works the
01:00 - first time you upload a build you have
01:02 - to go through their manual review
01:03 - process basically so they can verify
01:05 - that the game works and has nothing
01:06 - malicious in it after the first manual
01:08 - build review then you can easily upload
01:10 - any new version without issue so that
01:12 - means I only need the nice polish demo
01:14 - done by the 19th but in order to have
01:16 - time to go through the review process I
01:17 - need to openload a working build at the
01:19 - latest by d10 so anyways if I keep
01:21 - working like this like I did this week
01:23 - then that should be doable on the last
01:24 - devlog I already had quite a lot of
01:26 - mechanics so now it was mostly just
01:27 - continuing to build upon it I already
01:29 - had all of these buildings and all these
01:31 - moving vehicles and container buildings
01:32 - once again thanks to the power fighting
01:34 - good clean code I was able to easily add
01:36 - tons more features really quickly first
01:38 - was the crafting mechanic which
01:39 - obviously the game has to have a
01:41 - crafting mechanic personally I love
01:42 - crafting in just about any game so of
01:44 - course I wanted to add it to my own game
01:45 - thankfully it's actually pretty easy
01:47 - crafting really just means inputs and
01:49 - outputs I actually made a video quite a
01:51 - long time ago on how to make a nice
01:52 - crafting system just like Minecraft that
01:54 - one is using strip mall objects so here
01:56 - I'm doing pretty much exactly the same
01:57 - thing the one big design question is do
01:59 - I use a container building for the input
02:01 - another one for the output or do I just
02:03 - toss the output item right in the air
02:04 - end up going with throwing the output
02:06 - item just because I think it's a bit
02:07 - more fun to watch the item as it flies
02:09 - away unfortunately like the recipe that
02:11 - was actually the tricky part or not
02:13 - necessarily tricky just very time
02:14 - consuming building the entire UI
02:16 - definitely took much longer than
02:17 - expected for some reason I thought I
02:19 - could quickly build out on the uis
02:20 - around the machine in about one hour but
02:22 - I was definitely deeply mistaken in
02:24 - reality it took more like six hours to
02:26 - get it all working one really tricky
02:28 - part was the UI for selecting which
02:30 - container building is linked now I want
02:31 - the game to have lots of Interlocking
02:33 - Systems so all the buildings are nicely
02:34 - separated the crafting requires an input
02:36 - but the crafting building doesn't come
02:38 - with that input so it's up to the player
02:40 - to construct a container building and
02:42 - then link them both together this way
02:43 - only buildings work very well with one
02:45 - another which makes the player have
02:46 - quite a bit more ownership over the
02:47 - world so I think that's fun I use render
02:49 - textures to show all of the nearby
02:51 - container buildings I also covered red
02:53 - detections in detail in a previous video
02:55 - it's a really awesome EMT tool you
02:57 - should definitely know about them but
02:58 - making the Y was really tricky I
03:00 - refactored the code for selecting the
03:01 - link container building about five times
03:03 - constantly writing and rewriting code
03:05 - which I guess this is a teaching moment
03:07 - so regardless of how experienced you are
03:09 - and I do have quite a lot of experience
03:10 - I still write and rewrite and refactor
03:12 - tons of code I definitely don't get it
03:14 - all working the first time so if you
03:16 - don't write your code perfectly the
03:17 - first time that's perfectly normal
03:18 - that's exactly what happens to everyone
03:19 - so anyways I wanted to be really well
03:22 - written since I knew and lots of
03:23 - buildings would use this same element
03:24 - now if you want to learn how to write
03:26 - Googling code then check out my free
03:28 - course in the multiplier expansion
03:29 - alternatively for more advanced level
03:31 - check out my turn-based strategy course
03:33 - which I just recently updated with the
03:34 - second free expansion anyways back to
03:36 - the game so the UI took quite a lot of
03:38 - work it's very janky I definitely need
03:40 - to remake this for the final demo but
03:42 - for now it's functional so that's good
03:43 - enough I can go up to any building and
03:45 - interact with it to open up the UI for
03:47 - that building and then I can modify the
03:49 - settings for that building by the way
03:50 - the way the interactions work is I'm
03:52 - using a real nice interface just like I
03:53 - covered in a nice NPCs video then the
03:56 - next step was handling the building now
03:58 - initially when I first saw it was why
04:00 - don't I do it just like I've done in
04:01 - pretty much all my games meaning just
04:03 - have some buttons at the bottom where I
04:05 - can select what building I want to
04:06 - construct and then just like to place it
04:07 - now that works very well for Mouse based
04:09 - games but this game is meant to be more
04:10 - controller friendly so I didn't really
04:12 - want a button overlay my solution is
04:14 - actually something that I'm very happy
04:15 - with I made some proper objects to hold
04:17 - essentially the building blueprint now
04:19 - for me I love dragon ball and I love the
04:21 - sci-fi capsules that Bulma makes just a
04:23 - tiny capsule then she throws around and
04:25 - the building is constructed so here I
04:27 - did pretty much exactly that I made some
04:29 - more objects these are regular carry
04:31 - objects so any object can carry them
04:32 - however they extend the base word
04:34 - modular class to add some more data for
04:36 - which building it is then I easily added
04:38 - the recipes for all these objects
04:40 - obviously none of the inputs are real
04:41 - right now they all just cost one green
04:43 - gem but they won't have a proper
04:45 - building cost now the next mechanic is a
04:47 - simple but very important one the game
04:49 - is meant to have lots of resources but
04:50 - obviously resources have different tiers
04:52 - the basic style resources should be
04:54 - eased together but then other hand
04:56 - leveling resources those should require
04:58 - some special attack together the
04:59 - solution that I came up with was to make
05:01 - a resource area which is where a
05:03 - resource exists in the world and then I
05:05 - Define how many of those resources are
05:06 - spawned natural so for things like basic
05:09 - apples which is the food that the
05:10 - dinkies eat for this I can just make
05:12 - them spawn constantly but then for
05:14 - purple gems which are a much more
05:15 - advanced resource for this one I made it
05:17 - so that nothing spawns constantly but
05:19 - the resource area is still there in
05:20 - order to get resources the player needs
05:22 - to Resource some kind of fracking
05:23 - machine which when placed on top of the
05:25 - resource spawn area it suddenly spawns
05:27 - some resource so this is another nice
05:28 - mechanic which works alongside all of
05:30 - the other regular machines now I've
05:31 - actually got a design question to ask
05:33 - you related to this mechanic but before
05:34 - that here's the last two mechanics that
05:36 - I worked on this week first is an
05:37 - extremely important mechanic which is
05:39 - the heat mechanic honestly I don't know
05:41 - if that's quite a good name for it I'll
05:43 - definitely have to think about the name
05:44 - a bit more but basically every game
05:46 - needs some sort of antagonist and in
05:48 - this case it's a zombies which want to
05:49 - eat the dinkies so I want a mechanic
05:51 - that will handle basically how the
05:52 - zombies are spawned I didn't want to
05:54 - have just a basic wave spawn timer that
05:56 - the player had no control over I wanted
05:58 - a bit more skill base and I also want to
06:00 - encourage the player to think carefully
06:01 - about how they set up all of their
06:02 - automation machines so my answer to that
06:04 - design problem is the heat mechanic
06:06 - which defines how many zoombies are
06:07 - spawned and how often and how the heat
06:09 - is calculated that one is based on loose
06:11 - objects in the world basically objects
06:13 - like the output for the mining machine
06:14 - these experience panlets the building
06:16 - capsules the heat manager simply Cycles
06:18 - through the entire map and counts up all
06:20 - of these objects these this mechanic is
06:22 - meant to encourage the players to make
06:23 - their colony nice and efficient rather
06:24 - than just Gathering resources Non-Stop
06:26 - and it also has a fun secondary benefit
06:28 - since it encourages the player to clean
06:30 - up the world it also actually helps in
06:31 - terms of performance since some of these
06:33 - loose objects these are own physics
06:34 - objects I also want this mechanic to be
06:36 - kind of self-correcting meaning kind of
06:38 - like Dynamic difficulty if the player is
06:40 - doing badly then it will essentially
06:41 - become easier so if the player has tons
06:43 - of objects all over the place then there
06:45 - won't be tons of zombies spawned and
06:46 - those will then overrun the player and
06:48 - eat all of the dinkies but then as that
06:50 - happens these zombies spawn a mountain
06:51 - intensity that one is based not just on
06:53 - the heat amount but also on the dinky
06:55 - Mount so as a zombie seat a bunch of
06:56 - dinkies and a bunch of objects then
06:58 - difficulty will essentially go down that
07:00 - way if the player messes up and is
07:01 - overrun it's not an immediate game over
07:02 - but it will destroy tons of the colony
07:04 - and at the same time make future waves
07:06 - much more easy so they can take their
07:08 - time to rebuild now the next mechanic
07:10 - that I worked on is the opposite of this
07:11 - one which is a dinky spawning I had a
07:13 - rough idea for what I wanted but I still
07:15 - need to sit down and think exactly what
07:17 - do I want I know that I want the dinkies
07:19 - to be based on houses the player builds
07:21 - some houses and then Dickies simply
07:22 - spawned from those houses so I
07:24 - refactored the house to have a list of
07:25 - dinkies all the dinkies that were
07:27 - spawned there there's unlimited dinky
07:28 - per each house then every x amount of
07:30 - time basically the dinky spawner goes
07:32 - through all the houses finds all the
07:33 - houses that still have a valid thank you
07:35 - position and simply spawns a brand new
07:37 - dinky so right now this is really just
07:38 - the bare bones design for this mechanic
07:40 - and then next week I want to flash this
07:41 - out quite a bit more speaking of next
07:43 - week here are some design questions that
07:45 - I'm thinking about that maybe you might
07:46 - help me answer as well as what I'm going
07:48 - to work on next week so first design
07:49 - question is related to the resource node
07:51 - spawn areas right now I'm just placing
07:53 - the game object in the editor but
07:55 - obviously the player needs to be able to
07:56 - see where these resource node areas are
07:58 - now the first obvious answer is some
08:00 - kind of overlay I've actually done that
08:02 - pretty much in every single one of my
08:03 - Sim games there's always some overlay to
08:05 - see some more data but just like what I
08:07 - mentioned with the UI that doesn't
08:08 - really seem to fit this game I really
08:10 - want this to be more controller based
08:11 - more worm based so right now I'm
08:13 - actually thinking something more like an
08:14 - item that the player can equip which
08:16 - then enables them to speed the spawn
08:17 - areas something like some kind of radar
08:19 - and then that actually leads me to the
08:21 - second design question which I also
08:22 - don't have an answer for which is if I
08:24 - give the player the ability to hold
08:25 - special items how exactly am I going to
08:27 - do that so do I do some kind of
08:29 - invisible infinite inventory that's one
08:32 - approach or do I keep the player holding
08:34 - the items just like they can right now
08:36 - carry some physical objects personally I
08:37 - really like the physicality of seeing
08:39 - the player holding the objects but
08:41 - obviously that limits the player to just
08:42 - holding one special item at a time now
08:44 - technically that design can be fun
08:46 - especially since the main goal only is
08:47 - for the game to be multiplayer so I do
08:49 - like the idea of having players work
08:51 - together as a team and each carrying a
08:52 - different item but at the same time that
08:54 - could also become more annoying than
08:55 - interesting yet another related design
08:58 - question is what am I going to do about
08:59 - combat now I'm thinking the player would
09:01 - be able to hold some kind of baseball
09:02 - bat or some kind of mini pistol to
09:04 - really take out the zombies but again do
09:06 - I go with an infinite invisible
09:07 - inventory or do I force a player to
09:10 - carry and drop the weapon like I said
09:11 - these are some questions that I'm
09:12 - thinking about still don't have a clear
09:14 - answer so let me know your thoughts on
09:15 - these design questions now here's what
09:17 - I'm planning to work on next week and
09:18 - some more design questions first of all
09:20 - I want to implement the power system
09:21 - right now the buildings they don't work
09:23 - for no cost I want power to have cost
09:25 - I'm thinking about making some kind of
09:27 - power object that the player can then
09:28 - feed into the machines then I want to
09:30 - implement the trash mechanic like I said
09:31 - the heat mechanic is all based on loose
09:33 - object so I want some way to destroy
09:35 - those objects and that's where the trash
09:36 - mechanic comes in basically the player
09:38 - won't be able to have some kind of
09:39 - building where they can input something
09:40 - and just destroy that object then I also
09:42 - want to work on tier 2 dinkies and
09:44 - crafting now thinking along the lines of
09:46 - something like Anno where some higher
09:47 - tier people require some more complex
09:49 - items then I also want to implement some
09:51 - more automation interactions this is
09:53 - another design question which is right
09:54 - now I like how the automation
09:55 - interactions work so I've got a mining
09:57 - machine tosses an item then the atom
09:59 - wherever picks it up and drops it on the
10:00 - container counter and then the moving
10:02 - vehicle moves it around those are good
10:03 - but at the same time all those machines
10:05 - pretty much just interact with one other
10:06 - machine I want a bit more complex
10:08 - interactions I want each machine to be
10:10 - able to work with a variety of others so
10:11 - the player can really Flex their
10:13 - creative muscles so I definitely need to
10:14 - think long and hard about that and then
10:15 - I want to implement the game and goal
10:17 - the idea right now is you repopulate
10:20 - this one with tons of keys and then
10:21 - basically construct a rocket to fly out
10:23 - into space and then colonize another
10:25 - world so I need to make the mechanic for
10:27 - defining the gong and then sort of
10:28 - record the gameplay to see if the world
10:30 - is safe so that the player can actually
10:31 - exit finally the most important thing
10:34 - that I really need to implement is
10:35 - actually an obvious one which is
10:36 - Implement networking right now the game
10:38 - is only single player but it's obviously
10:40 - meant to be multiplier it is meant to
10:42 - have both options and in order to make
10:43 - the belt for review I do need it to have
10:45 - working multiplayer I have no idea how
10:47 - complex this fast won't be I did really
10:49 - enjoy working with network for game
10:51 - objects that was surprisingly easy but
10:53 - still this could be quite difficult so
10:55 - perhaps next week this is actually all
10:56 - that I'll be able to do but still this
10:58 - week was very productive hopefully next
10:59 - week won't be the same so stay tuned for
11:01 - the next level now as you can see from
11:02 - this video I'm experimenting with a
11:04 - different sound for these Devon walks to
11:05 - hopefully make them a bit more
11:06 - interesting let me know in the comments
11:08 - if you like this style for more General
11:09 - devlogs I'll probably keep doing regular
11:11 - videos just without camera just a voice
11:13 - over whenever I do some kind of Deep
11:14 - dive like the one that I'm planning for
11:16 - the automation mechanics but for General
11:18 - levels I think this style might be
11:19 - better either way let me know in the
11:20 - comment alright so go ahead and thank
11:22 - you Gardens here wishlist thank you for
11:24 - watching and I'll see you next time
11:39 - [Music]
