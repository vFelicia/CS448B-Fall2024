00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - in this video we're continuing to make a
00:03 - tool tip in unity we're going to add the
00:05 - ability to flash a warning let's begin
00:09 - so here is our window and here is our
00:12 - Tilton
00:13 - it shows up when we pass the mouse over
00:15 - a button and displays text which in here
00:18 - is static and in here we have text that
00:20 - is updated on every frame so this attack
00:22 - button has the cool-down behind it and
00:25 - again we can see the cooldown displayed
00:27 - on the tooltip updating on every frame
00:29 - so this is great for displaying extra
00:31 - information to the player now something
00:34 - else that is also very useful is
00:35 - flashing the tooltip whenever we have
00:37 - some important warning information like
00:39 - for example an error message so in this
00:41 - case we could show a flashing warning
00:44 - when we click on the attack button if
00:46 - the cool-down isn't over yet now there
00:49 - are several ways we can do this we could
00:51 - modify this class to add that behavior
00:53 - however in doing so we would make this
00:55 - class needlessly complex and cause many
00:58 - issues with having a tanta any warning
01:00 - visible at the same time so what I
01:02 - normally do in my games is have the
01:04 - normal tooltip and then a separate total
01:06 - warning class this causes some code
01:09 - duplication but keeps our analogic nice
01:10 - and simple so here in our project folder
01:13 - let's duplicate our tooltip class and
01:16 - let's call this the tooltip
01:17 - warning so here we just change the name
01:20 - and here we also duplicate our transform
01:23 - this is the total tip and then we have
01:25 - these auto boarding and drag over and
01:28 - you only create a class okay so we now
01:30 - have two separate tooltips that we can
01:32 - use so let's see the tooltip warning
01:34 - code here is the class and most of the
01:36 - code won't be mostly the same so for
01:39 - example following the mouse that acts on
01:41 - both tooltips and setting the text as
01:43 - well one of the main differences is that
01:45 - the warning is meant to be visible only
01:48 - for a short while whereas the normal
01:49 - tooltip is visible until it is actually
01:52 - manually hidden so let's create a very
01:55 - simple timer to hide it after some time
01:57 - so appear we simply make a private float
01:59 - for the show timer and on our update
02:02 - let's simply reduce that timer by
02:04 - time.deltatime and if it is under zero
02:08 - then we want to hide our total and in
02:13 - our show total function we're going to
02:16 - have an optional parameter for a float
02:18 - show timer Max and let's default it to
02:21 - two seconds
02:24 - and here we simply set our show timer to
02:28 - be our show timer max so we start off at
02:31 - let's say 2 seconds and then comes down
02:33 - every frame when it's under zero it
02:35 - should hide the total ok so which is a
02:37 - very simple timer but it should be
02:38 - working so let's go into our window
02:40 - class and here on our attack button
02:43 - let's do a simple if if the attack come
02:46 - down if it is bigger than 0 then we are
02:49 - currently in the attack cooldown so in
02:52 - here we want to showcase a warning so
02:54 - we're going to our tooltip warning class
02:56 - and we want to show a simple warning
03:00 - saying cannot attack and if not then we
03:04 - do the attack which just sets the attack
03:07 - kunda ok
03:08 - so let's test ok here is the normal tool
03:11 - tips on works perfectly fine if I click
03:13 - on the attack the normal one still works
03:15 - click again and yet there you go there's
03:17 - the cannot attack warning message and
03:19 - after a while the message went away
03:21 - alright so the basics for our warnings
03:24 - on tip are working we have a warning
03:26 - that we can display and it stays
03:27 - displayed and stays following the mouse
03:30 - just like the normal tone tip and
03:32 - disappears after some time now obviously
03:34 - since this is meant to be a warning we
03:36 - want to make it more visible so let's do
03:38 - a simple flashing animation so we're
03:40 - here on our updates let's create a
03:42 - simple flash so we need some variables
03:45 - for that so a float for the flash timer
03:48 - and they end for the flash state so here
03:56 - we increase the flash timer by
03:57 - time.deltatime let's also define a float
04:01 - for the flash timer Max and if the flash
04:06 - timer if it is bigger than the flash
04:08 - timer max then let's increase the flash
04:12 - state and then we do a switch on the
04:16 - flash state so just like that every time
04:19 - we go past flash timer max the state
04:21 - won't increase so in here using odds and
04:24 - evens we can set a different color to
04:26 - make a very simple animation so case we
04:29 - have state of 1 let's set our tooltip
04:32 - text that color
04:35 - into wines and we also want to change
04:39 - the background color so here let's grab
04:41 - a image for our background image and we
04:49 - set the background to a red color in
04:51 - case we have a too we do essentially the
04:55 - reverse we put the background in white
04:57 - and we put the text in red so just like
05:01 - that we should have a nice flash now
05:03 - again we don't want it to flash just
05:04 - once so we can simply add a few more
05:07 - cases so like this we should have a nice
05:12 - flash so now all we need to do is go
05:14 - down into the show tooltip and here we
05:19 - set our variable so set the flash time
05:20 - we're back to zero and the flash state
05:23 - also back to zero okay so when we show
05:27 - our tone tip we set the flash timer and
05:29 - flash state both to zero then on every
05:32 - frame we increase the flash timer by the
05:34 - adult time if it is above flash time or
05:36 - max which in this case is set to 30
05:38 - frames per second if it is we increase
05:41 - the flash state and if it is either one
05:43 - three or five then we show the tooltip
05:45 - using a white color and the background
05:47 - using a red color if there is a two or a
05:49 - four then we show the tone tip in red
05:51 - and the background in white so again on
05:54 - our window we have our warning being
05:56 - shown if we click once the attack
05:58 - cooldown is still active so let's see if
06:01 - that is flashing saying cannot attack
06:03 - okay here we are
06:05 - there's the tooltip working perfectly
06:06 - fine there's the attack if I click once
06:08 - yep there's a code out now click again
06:10 - if there you go a nice very visible
06:13 - warning saying we cannot attack because
06:14 - the calm down is still active and as you
06:17 - can see this is great for displaying
06:18 - error messages to the player so there
06:21 - you have it we took our tooltip and
06:22 - duplicated it to create a warning tone
06:24 - tip that flashes to show the player a
06:26 - error message as always you can download
06:28 - the project files and utilities from
06:30 - unity code monkey comm if you have any
06:32 - questions post them in the comments and
06:33 - I'll do my best to answer them subscribe
06:35 - for more videos and I'll see you next
