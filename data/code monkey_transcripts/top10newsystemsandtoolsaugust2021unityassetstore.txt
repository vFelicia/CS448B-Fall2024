00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:01 - the asset source full of awesome tools
00:03 - and assets to help you make your own
00:05 - games there's more and more awesome
00:06 - stuff coming out every month so in this
00:08 - video let's check out some of the
00:09 - highlights that were released in july of
00:11 - 2021. this is the list of paid systems
00:14 - and tools in the last video i already
00:16 - covered the best free new assets so go
00:18 - check that if you haven't seen it yet
00:20 - and in the next video i will be covering
00:21 - the top assets and effects let me know
00:23 - which ones of these you're most
00:25 - interested in and i might do a detailed
00:26 - review on it as always there's links to
00:28 - the ads in the description and as a
00:30 - bonus you can use the coupon code
00:31 - monkey10 to get 10 off your order
00:34 - and by the way right now there's a mega
00:35 - bundle happening it's a massive discount
00:37 - at 95 percent off it's pretty nice in
00:39 - terms of variety lots of systems props
00:41 - particles and sounds these bundles are
00:43 - always great value if just one of these
00:45 - assets interests you then the home
00:46 - bundle is worth it check the link in the
00:48 - description to see it and by the way
00:50 - check out my own assets on the store so
00:51 - far i've made the free key door system
00:53 - which is a super simple way to add keys
00:56 - and doors to your games and the mouse
00:57 - cursor system pro which is a very easy
01:00 - to use tool to help you create some
01:01 - custom animated cursors to really make
01:03 - your game stand out i'm currently
01:05 - working on converting more videos into
01:06 - pro systems so stay tuned for that
01:08 - alright so starting off with one that is
01:10 - possibly extremely useful the low poly
01:13 - mesh generator so one of the issues with
01:15 - picking up third-party assets is making
01:17 - them all look like they fit together
01:19 - that's when the reasons why i like the
01:21 - low poly style it's very consistent
01:24 - but there's also a ton of realistic
01:25 - assets that would possibly work great
01:27 - with your game but they don't fit within
01:29 - low poly style so that's where this acid
01:31 - comes in you take a high-end mesh and it
01:34 - generates a low-poly mesh
01:36 - meaning that you can use all of the
01:37 - high-end realistic models that you
01:39 - already have and use them in a low poly
01:41 - game while keeping the look of the game
01:43 - very consistent this really seems like
01:45 - an excellent tool i never thought about
01:46 - this approach as an option so i'm very
01:48 - interested in checking this one out then
01:50 - if you want to highlight some parts of
01:52 - your models here is bone zones easily
01:55 - split your model into various zones so
01:57 - very good for making some weak points on
01:59 - your enemies or maybe you add some
02:01 - dismemberment mechanics kind of like
02:03 - that space based on the video it seems
02:05 - like it works very well you can make as
02:07 - many areas as you need and use them to
02:09 - make some interesting mechanics
02:11 - if you're working on a game with
02:12 - vehicles check out this simple live
02:14 - recreator
02:16 - start with a blank canvas and paint all
02:18 - the details change the base color add a
02:20 - bunch of decals on top really build
02:22 - something nice it comes with two
02:24 - vehicles and over 75 stickers vectors
02:27 - and shapes
02:28 - it works on those vehicles but really it
02:30 - can work on any mesh from what i can
02:32 - tell this is running when you play the
02:34 - game meaning that you can include this
02:36 - tool in your game in order to let the
02:37 - players create their own libraries and
02:39 - in combination with the previous asset
02:41 - here is the mobile drift physics also
02:43 - from the same developer it's a drift
02:45 - physics system uses to quickly get a
02:48 - racing drifting game working naturally
02:50 - it includes all the mobile controls also
02:52 - has a very detailed documentation
02:54 - explaining all the components
02:56 - these types of systems are all about
02:58 - feel so thankfully they have a demo on
03:00 - the page that you can try before you buy
03:03 - if instead you're interested in physics
03:05 - puzzle platformers here's a great
03:06 - starting pack this is very much similar
03:09 - to games like gangbeast or human fall
03:11 - flat it's a fully featured fully working
03:13 - framework so this is perfect for picking
03:15 - it apart and seeing how it all works
03:18 - everything is of course using physics so
03:20 - it leads to some very wacky gameplay
03:22 - lots of boxes and buttons to push you
03:24 - can grab a home to something and rappel
03:26 - down use the elevator or grab some
03:28 - planks if you are interested in this
03:30 - genre definitely study this one then
03:32 - here's a really interesting one for a
03:34 - level design the procedural generation
03:36 - grid it's a very powerful tool for
03:39 - automating level creation you define a
03:41 - whole bunch of rules a whole bunch of
03:43 - assets and then the algorithm designs
03:44 - where to place all the objects
03:47 - looking at the video the results are
03:48 - pretty great i wouldn't say that those
03:50 - levels were procedurally generated don't
03:52 - look very natural you can use it
03:54 - internally without writing any code or
03:56 - if you want you can also use code to
03:58 - create some unique raw notes it works
04:00 - for both generating objects and edit
04:02 - time as well as during play mode so this
04:04 - is one of those things that if you put
04:06 - in the time to learn this tool i can see
04:07 - it being a massive time saver
04:09 - also this one is currently in beta which
04:11 - is actually great because it means that
04:13 - the current price is already 50 off the
04:15 - final price so if you're interested get
04:17 - it quick up next here is lean texture
04:19 - plus
04:20 - this is a tool for doing just about
04:22 - anything to do with textures it features
04:25 - channel packing seamless texture
04:26 - conversion normal map generation edge
04:29 - coloring really tons and tons of actions
04:31 - you can take on just about any texture
04:33 - this looks like a great tool so you can
04:35 - use textures that you get from various
04:37 - asset packs and make them fit into your
04:39 - games
04:40 - and it also has a bunch of effects like
04:42 - tint blur pixelate and more it works
04:44 - both in the editor as well as in game
04:46 - there's also a free version you can try
04:48 - out so it's a really interesting tool
04:50 - i'd love to try this one out
04:51 - then for something very niche and very
04:53 - interesting the face recognition system
04:56 - you give it the image of a face then an
04:58 - image with a lot of faces and it
05:00 - recognizes that one face
05:02 - it works offline so there's no
05:03 - connection required to any external
05:05 - server like i said this is a very niche
05:07 - tool i'm guessing maybe this might be
05:09 - very useful when working on some ar
05:11 - games or perhaps just for building some
05:13 - tool within unity always remember that
05:16 - unity isn't just for making games you
05:17 - can build anything this one also has a
05:20 - free version you can try out
05:21 - and up next here is orvis dot strains
05:24 - in last month's video i highlighted a
05:27 - dots character controller and now here
05:28 - we have a terrain like i said back then
05:31 - it's great that there's a bunch of dots
05:32 - still starting to come out
05:34 - this one is all about terrain which is
05:36 - perfect for that it lets you create some
05:39 - massive insanely detailed terrains
05:41 - since dots is insanely fast you can
05:43 - easily modify terrain during run time it
05:46 - all runs on jobs so it never blocks the
05:47 - main thread
05:49 - vegetation is streamed in and out based
05:51 - on the camera position
05:52 - and it also includes a floating origin
05:54 - system so you can build some insanely
05:56 - massive worlds
05:57 - works on both flat terrain as well as
05:59 - some spherical terrains it's a real
06:01 - impressive asset again just like the
06:03 - other one this one can be a great tool
06:05 - to learn from you can get it and inspect
06:07 - the source code to see how it all works
06:09 - and then we have the leaning animator it
06:11 - does exactly what it says adds some
06:13 - leaning to your animations to add that
06:15 - extra bit of polish it's subtle but it
06:17 - definitely makes a difference worse for
06:19 - leaning to the sides while running in
06:21 - circles but also for making the
06:22 - character appear much more natural when
06:24 - going up or down the rims features a
06:26 - custom inspector to really make it super
06:28 - easy to use
06:30 - if you're in the polished stage of your
06:31 - game definitely look into this one
06:33 - alright so those are my top 10 new tools
06:35 - and systems on the unity asset store for
06:37 - july of 2021 there's links to all in the
06:40 - description and as a bonus you can use
