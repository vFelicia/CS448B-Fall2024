00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're going to use the
00:03 - camera system we created previously to
00:05 - move the camera when the mouse touches
00:07 - the edges of the screen well let's get
00:09 - sir
00:13 - so we previously created our camera
00:15 - system and made it very easy to move and
00:18 - zoom around a position so for the scene
00:21 - let's set up our camera to form a
00:22 - position that I will manually move with
00:24 - the keyboard and then later add movement
00:26 - with the mouse so let's go into my game
00:30 - or I have a reference to my cameraphone
00:32 - script so as you saw in the previous
00:34 - video we created a setup function inside
00:37 - that setup function we send it a func
00:40 - that returns a vector3 so in this case
00:45 - let's make a private vector3 to hold our
00:49 - camera follow position and this is what
00:54 - we're going to send to our camera home
00:56 - script and for our zoom let's just send
00:59 - a fixed value let's say a TF just a
01:02 - fixed zoom we don't want to touch that
01:03 - for now so on our private void update we
01:08 - want to test for keyboard input so we're
01:11 - going to do if input dot get king of T
01:14 - code w we're going to implement wise
01:18 - movement so if we press W we're going to
01:21 - increase our camera follow position Y
01:25 - we're going to increase it by a move
01:28 - around and go here float move amount and
01:33 - let's say 20 M + x time.deltatime so
01:38 - this code is frame rate and the pennant
01:41 - okay do the same thing for all the other
01:43 - keys okay so here is my keyboard input
01:51 - and we should now be able to control the
01:53 - camera using the keyboard let's go into
01:55 - our scene test it out there it is I can
01:58 - press W and moves up I can process moves
02:01 - down D moves right and a moves left
02:04 - okay let's actually increase the speed
02:06 - but you know the controls are working so
02:09 - we now have our camera following the
02:12 - vector three for our camera follow
02:14 - position and we're modifying that vector
02:16 - 3 using keyboard input so let's also
02:18 - modify that when the mouse touches the
02:21 - edges of the screen so on our update
02:24 - down here
02:25 - we're going to do a test based on our
02:26 - input mouse position and our screen dot
02:29 - width so in here if input dot Mouse
02:33 - position dot X if it is bigger than the
02:37 - screen dot width minus a edge size
02:41 - let's set up a edge size in here and
02:45 - let's say 10 pixels so if the mouse
02:49 - position that X is bigger than the width
02:51 - minus our edge size so if it is with
02:54 - within 10 pixels of the right side we're
02:56 - going to move it to the right so let's
02:59 - see here I am here's my mouse and when I
03:03 - moved to right when I get within 10
03:05 - pixels it starts moving yep there it is
03:09 - okay let's increase our edge size a
03:11 - little bit and that's support for all
03:13 - the other edges so in here we have
03:15 - moving to the right now let's add moving
03:18 - to the left so that is if the X is less
03:21 - than the edge size then we move to the
03:24 - left then if input that Mouse position
03:27 - dot y if it is bigger than the screen
03:31 - dot height minus our edge size then we
03:35 - want to move up and if it is under the
03:40 - edge size and we want to move down okay
03:44 - so this is the edge to our right this is
03:48 - edge what-o
03:52 - and edge down let's test it out Here I
03:57 - am I can still move it with the keyboard
03:59 - and now let's move the mouse and when I
04:01 - get to the edge there you go moving to
04:04 - the right stops moving up stops moving
04:07 - down stops and moving left and stops
04:10 - okay let's had a simple boolean to
04:13 - enable and disable edge scrolling so
04:16 - let's go up here and make a private bull
04:20 - edge sprawling and on our update let's
04:25 - enable it by pressing space so if input
04:28 - not yet key down
04:31 - of keycode space if we press space let's
04:35 - set our edge scrolling to the inverse of
04:38 - edge scrolling let's pop up a message
04:42 - displaying if it's enabled or disabled
04:44 - so let's go into our code monkey tony's
04:47 - using the CMD bug class which is always
04:50 - you can grab the code monkey utilities
04:52 - from unity code monkey comm so let's go
04:54 - make a text pop up on the mouse position
04:57 - and say edge scrolling and then + edge
05:02 - scrolling and in here we're only going
05:05 - to test this if we are edge from down
05:09 - here and there you go okay let's see if
05:13 - we can enable and disable by pressing
05:15 - space okay here I am I'm moving with a
05:18 - keyboard okay great I go to the side
05:20 - then it is currently disabled I hit
05:23 - space and I can move to the side move up
05:26 - down left right okay awesome I hit space
05:29 - again and it's disabled and there you
05:32 - have it we can Pan the camera normally
05:34 - with a keyboard or scroll by moving the
05:36 - mouse to the edges as always you can
05:39 - download the project files in utilities
05:40 - for free from unity code monkey comm if
05:43 - you have any questions post them in the
05:45 - comments and I'll do my best answer okay
05:47 - see you next time
06:00 - you
