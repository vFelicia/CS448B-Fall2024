00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made with young teen launch in
00:05 - June 23. this was quite an interesting
00:06 - month I thought perhaps there would be a
00:08 - few releases because the steam Festival
00:10 - but not really still tons of games and
00:12 - still very difficult to pick just 10.
00:13 - the reason why I make these videos is to
00:15 - show you everything the engine can do
00:16 - the limit is really just your own skills
00:18 - and Imagination and the variety and the
00:20 - awesomeness of the game shown here
00:21 - really puts out to the test of these
00:22 - games are uniquely impressive so don't
00:24 - listen to no particular order except for
00:25 - the number one game that is my personal
00:27 - pick them also speaking of the steam
00:29 - Festival my own game dinky Guardians was
00:30 - part of it with a free demo which is
00:32 - still available right now it's a fun
00:34 - Solo or Co-op game with some automation
00:36 - building and defense where you must keep
00:38 - the tiny defenseless dinkies safe from
00:40 - harm go try out a demo edit your
00:42 - wishlist and phone for devops alright so
00:43 - starting off at number 10 with a fun
00:45 - unique game called Driftwood this one is
00:47 - all about downhill longboarding and very
00:49 - importantly you play as a sloth so
00:51 - definitely a very nice genre but great
00:53 - presentation the concept of a sloth
00:55 - going downhill at high speeds is
00:56 - definitely quite interesting personally
00:58 - I love the original style very nice and
00:59 - appealing it looks like a more slightly
01:02 - casual racing game which personally I
01:03 - quite like you've got some drift
01:05 - controls to go down on turns in a nice
01:07 - satisfying way there's a trick system so
01:09 - you can do 360s and keep on going you
01:11 - can travel to new places and experience
01:13 - some interesting tracks all with a nice
01:15 - relaxing soundtrack you can play either
01:16 - solo for a nice casual time or if you
01:19 - prefer there is also a competitive mode
01:20 - where every second counts it is out now
01:22 - in Early Access with 200 very positive
01:24 - reviews then for some building and
01:26 - physics here is Mars personal Logistics
01:28 - it's a very physically accurate
01:30 - simulator where you build some machines
01:32 - from realistic pieces and set them up to
01:34 - complete all kinds of tasks like name
01:36 - implies you're on Mars so you start off
01:38 - with some basic machines just some
01:40 - wheels and Grabber easy to pick up a
01:42 - simple object and move it around then
01:43 - you complete some missions and unlock
01:45 - new parts to play with the level of
01:47 - customization is truly insane there are
01:49 - tons of parts that can be combined in an
01:51 - infinite way to build any machine you
01:52 - can think of the missions involve
01:54 - carrying all sorts of strangely shaped
01:56 - objects and you need to build your
01:57 - machine in such a way that it can
01:59 - actually pick up those objects also has
02:01 - a nice visual Style with some thick
02:03 - outlines several games have done this
02:04 - already and I think it always looks good
02:06 - if you like some realistic physics
02:08 - Simulator games and this looks like a
02:09 - great new one it is out now in Early
02:11 - Access with 200 very positive reviews
02:13 - next here's one that is definitely not
02:15 - for me but it does look great it's
02:17 - called killer frequency personally I am
02:19 - not a fan of horror games I get scared
02:21 - way too easily so I don't normally look
02:23 - at them for these lists but this one has
02:25 - so many insanely positive reviews that I
02:27 - just have to give it a look and it
02:28 - actually doesn't seem to have too many
02:30 - jump squares so perhaps I could even
02:31 - handle this one the premise is you're a
02:34 - late night radio talk show host where
02:36 - the colors are being installed by a
02:38 - mysterious color it's essentially a
02:39 - first person puzzle game through your
02:41 - choices you can decide who lives and who
02:43 - dies and either don't listen to their
02:45 - size of relief or their screams of
02:47 - horror explore your surroundings gather
02:49 - some Clues and try to help each of your
02:51 - colors survive the night the voice
02:52 - acting is absolutely excellent and
02:54 - Visually the game also looks gorgeous
02:56 - this is something that a lot of horror
02:57 - games do very well all the SSRS super
03:00 - high quality tons of great effects it is
03:02 - out now with 500 overwhelmingly positive
03:04 - reviews so that is 95 positive so if
03:07 - this intrigues you definitely give it a
03:08 - look next if you're into Colony building
03:10 - with tons of objects and tons of
03:12 - automation here is novolence you'll land
03:14 - on an alien planet and you have your
03:16 - trusty rayton weapon thingy that can
03:18 - help you gather resources and construct
03:20 - buildings and machines start off by
03:22 - manually harvesting some resources then
03:24 - quickly boost your productivity with
03:25 - some automated Bots tell those Bots to
03:27 - grab resources from one place and drop
03:29 - them somewhere the map is really
03:31 - interesting in that it is based on tiles
03:33 - you explore the world and unlock more
03:35 - and more tiles which are very unique
03:36 - each style has different objects and
03:38 - different resources you can also engage
03:40 - in combat and uncover Mysteries you
03:42 - expand and get to a point where you can
03:44 - even build a spaceship and fly towards
03:46 - the Stars to mine some asteroids and
03:47 - bring them back to land this game looks
03:49 - really massive while also looking quite
03:51 - inviting and the mechanic of unlocking
03:53 - different tiles in the world makes it
03:54 - more quite interesting it is out now and
03:56 - already has 500 very positive reviews
03:58 - next here is one with a very unique
04:00 - visual mechanic it's called pallav it's
04:02 - a building game where you start on a
04:04 - small plot of land and slowly build
04:06 - vertically you build houses for your
04:08 - people then those people also have needs
04:10 - they need some power food water and all
04:12 - kinds of things keep building upwards
04:14 - and keep your people happy unlock new
04:16 - buildings and resources complete some
04:18 - islands and discover new ones or hop
04:20 - onto sandbox mode and build without any
04:22 - limitations visually it looks really
04:24 - great a very nice chill style so
04:26 - something kind of like landscaper but
04:28 - only in a really tiny confined space it
04:30 - looks like a nice mix between a very
04:32 - cozy and inviting game but also one
04:34 - where you must pay attention and fulfill
04:36 - the needs of your people and bonus
04:38 - points there's also a nice friendly
04:39 - whale you can pet it is out now in Early
04:41 - Access and has over 200 very positive
04:44 - reviews then every month there's tons of
04:46 - new vampire survival likes here's an
04:48 - interesting one called Army of Ruin
04:50 - features the gameplay that you expect
04:51 - with these kinds of games so tons and
04:53 - tons of units and lots of ways to get
04:55 - rid of them these games are also about
04:57 - polish and based on trailer this one
04:59 - will looks really satisfying to play
05:01 - it's a great case study to see how you
05:03 - can make just something like unlocking a
05:05 - chest feeling really satisfying features
05:07 - tons of unique abilities with some very
05:09 - unique visuals the game looks really
05:10 - nice and colorful which is also nice and
05:12 - different from all of the other vampire
05:14 - survival likes you can upgrade your
05:15 - weapons unlock better more powerful
05:17 - weapons take out thousands of enemies
05:19 - and do it all over again it is out now
05:21 - and already has over a thousand very
05:23 - positive reviews for some VR here is an
05:25 - awesome one called battle Talent it's a
05:28 - super fast-paced physics-based sword
05:30 - fighting world-like name this is one of
05:32 - those where I really love how it looks
05:33 - the gameplay looks excellent it's a nice
05:36 - mix of swords and pistols so you can
05:38 - slash your enemies throw them in the air
05:39 - and then shoot them so kind of like a
05:41 - first person Devil May Cry or the
05:43 - weapons also remind me of the movie
05:44 - equilibrium really awesome movie one of
05:46 - my favorites just based on the awesome
05:48 - style Beyond swords and pistols you also
05:50 - have some magic so you can throw some
05:51 - Fireballs or some ice spells and a bunch
05:53 - more all of the objects they are all
05:55 - physically based which makes it look
05:57 - really satisfying you can fight over 80
05:59 - enemy with a hundred weapons and 60
06:01 - perks on top of all that it even has
06:03 - already over a thousand player created
06:05 - mods now the question with melee and VR
06:08 - is just how good does it feel and this
06:10 - one seems so fast paced with some
06:11 - excellent sound effects that it does
06:13 - look like pairing and striking feels
06:15 - very satisfying it looks really intense
06:16 - which some people can't handle
06:18 - thankfully this one also has a free demo
06:20 - so if you want to try it out and see if
06:22 - you can handle this much movement give
06:23 - it a try it is out now with almost 200
06:25 - very positive views which is a great
06:27 - amount for a VR game then here is one
06:29 - that is targeted for a very specific
06:31 - audience which you can tell by the name
06:33 - alone it is called slayer's X terminal
06:36 - aftermath Vengeance of the Slayer with a
06:38 - name like that and visuals you can
06:40 - really tell that it's going for a really
06:41 - over the top retro style very old school
06:43 - visuals intentionally low quality assets
06:46 - and Sprites with some very inventive
06:47 - weapons and enemies the music is awesome
06:49 - I mostly don't pay attention to music
06:51 - but I really enjoyed listening to the
06:52 - trailer so if the final game has music
06:54 - just like that then that's awesome
06:55 - basically if you like retro Shooters if
06:58 - you enjoy what you're seeing right now
07:00 - then give it a shot it is out now and
07:01 - already has overwhelmingly positive
07:03 - reviews with over 500 of them at 98
07:06 - positive which is insane up next here is
07:09 - a very strange spin-off it's called
07:11 - Kingdom 80s this one is part of the
07:13 - Kingdom series those medieval sites
07:15 - rolling strategy games this one is all
07:17 - about being set in the 80s now that's a
07:19 - very strange concept for a spin-off but
07:21 - honestly I do think it looks great it
07:22 - features similar side swirling gameplay
07:24 - so you grab your bike going left or
07:27 - right pick up some coins you build up
07:28 - your town with some defenses and stay
07:30 - safe from these mysterious monsters it
07:32 - is more story focused so you can meet
07:34 - some unique characters and befriend them
07:36 - you can ride together and give them
07:37 - roles as either Builders or soldiers go
07:40 - out on adventures expand your kingdom
07:41 - fortify it with walls and defensive
07:43 - turrets and when the Night Comes then
07:45 - you can defend them during the day you
07:46 - can explore the town you can visit the
07:48 - shops or find some items on the skate
07:50 - park all in all it's definitely a
07:51 - strange concept for a spin-off but it
07:53 - doesn't look quite interesting it has
07:55 - mostly positive reviews with the main
07:56 - negative being the short duration but if
07:59 - you don't like the a 80 style and short
08:00 - story Focus games and give it a try and
08:03 - at number one for my personal pick the
08:04 - month here is a huge hit of this month
08:06 - battle bit remastered honestly it's not
08:08 - just a hit of this month but almost the
08:10 - biggest hit of the year it had Peak
08:12 - concurrent users of 86 000 this is an
08:14 - insane amount for any game let alone an
08:16 - indie game this likely means it already
08:18 - sold millions of copies the game itself
08:20 - is a massive online shooter with
08:22 - combined arms something like Battlefield
08:23 - meaning you've got some infantry
08:25 - helicopters tanks ships and a bunch more
08:27 - all fighting on huge worlds with 256
08:30 - players so really massive scale and it
08:32 - also features tons of very satisfying
08:34 - destruction so very much like
08:35 - Battlefield Bad Company 2 which
08:37 - personally I really love playing down
08:38 - the Gunplay is of course excellent for a
08:40 - game like this to be successful
08:41 - everything needs to be on point they
08:43 - also have a focus on high performance
08:45 - and high-tech rate servers clearly they
08:47 - focus very heavily on making the
08:48 - gameplay as perfect as possible features
08:50 - a classic class system with some Medics
08:53 - assault engineer Recon and support
08:54 - drones it's got 19 huge Dynamic maps and
08:57 - 45 weapons now this one is called
08:59 - remastered but I have no idea what the
09:00 - original was whatever it was clearly
09:02 - people wanted a bunch more it just
09:04 - recently came out and already has 25
09:07 - 000 very positive reviews even though
09:08 - it's only an early access truly one of
09:10 - the biggest hits not just this month but
09:12 - the entire year it's really awesome to
09:13 - see Indie devs find this much success
09:15 - from what I can find this team is mostly
09:17 - just three people working on this game
09:19 - for several years really impressive
09:20 - alright so that's 10 awesome new games
09:22 - made with Indian launch in June 23. I
09:24 - hope this list helped you see how the
09:25 - empty engine is capable of building
09:27 - anything the limits are really just your
09:28 - own skills and Imagination check out my
09:30 - own same game dinky Guardians and edit
