00:54 - you've got lots of awesome environments
00:55 - and most of these work with unity the
00:57 - unreal specific things are just these
00:58 - vehicles although technically could also
01:00 - just grab the models and the materials
01:02 - take it without the scripts and use it
01:03 - inside Unity so if you need tons of
01:05 - realistic awesome SES then check it out
01:07 - all right so starting off with a super
01:09 - highquality character here is a demonic
01:11 - Warrior it's a really cool design it
01:13 - looks like it could be a special
01:15 - character that lives in moror the
01:16 - character apparently has a name it's
01:18 - called arendel that really sounds like a
01:20 - very Lord the Rings like name or just
01:22 - fantasy it's got a sword some clot
01:24 - simulation and some face blend shapes
01:26 - this publisher makes some of the highest
01:28 - quality characters that I've seen so if
01:29 - if you want something super high-end
01:31 - definitely check out the entire page
01:32 - next up here is the latest Cindy asset
01:34 - and this one is very different from
01:36 - their usual it's a UI pack it's kind of
01:38 - interesting to see them explore
01:40 - different areas a while ago they also
01:41 - made their first animation pack this one
01:43 - is called sci-fi Soldier and looks
01:45 - really awesome you've got lots of
01:47 - Sliders buttons weapons mini Maps
01:49 - portraits and so on there's some loading
01:51 - screens some targeting rectangles
01:53 - there's lots of controls and tons of
01:54 - weapon and item icons looks like a
01:56 - really great pack I definitely hope they
01:58 - do more of these then here here's a
02:00 - really cool one it's an upgradeable car
02:02 - pack this one immediately reminded me of
02:04 - a game that I love playing as a kid it
02:05 - was called Gearhead garage and it was
02:07 - kind of a car mechanic Simulator game
02:09 - you could remove some screws and bolts
02:11 - you could fix some things and put them
02:13 - back together with this pack you could
02:14 - build a simple game just like that
02:16 - something based on buying a car and
02:18 - fixing or upgrading it this pack
02:20 - contains multiple bodies you've got
02:22 - various engines hoods wheels and a bunch
02:24 - more so this would be really great for
02:26 - some mechanic game or really just a
02:28 - racing game with some pre-made C T cars
02:30 - then if you need some particle effects
02:32 - here's a nice one these are sales which
02:34 - I personally always love this pack
02:36 - includes 60 effects everything from
02:38 - slashes aurus projectiles explosions
02:41 - there's some great looking fire some
02:42 - awesome looking stun or sleep effects or
02:44 - maybe just some nice smoke that you can
02:46 - combine with some powerful tornadoes
02:48 - next if you want a nice Battlefield
02:50 - check out this one this is a really huge
02:52 - pack almost 800 prefabs it's a
02:55 - battlefield with a ton of weapons some
02:57 - cannons and some great looking towers
02:59 - and Tents look at this one reminds me of
03:01 - the first mission in The Witcher 2 you
03:02 - could build a castle seed just like that
03:04 - with this pack the video looks really
03:06 - gorgeous with some nice natural lighting
03:08 - so whether you're making a castle game
03:10 - or really if you're just someone who
03:11 - likes to build worlds for fun then this
03:13 - looks like it would be great to play
03:14 - with then if you're making a Samurai
03:17 - game here is a modular Samurai it's a
03:19 - very high-end realistic model or
03:21 - actually multiple models being modular
03:23 - means that with just this one pack you
03:25 - can create hundreds of characters pretty
03:27 - much enough to populate an entire world
03:28 - you can make some really serious samurai
03:30 - or make some innocent villagers maybe
03:32 - some Yakuza members or some Farmers
03:35 - you've got plenty of different body
03:36 - parts and different materials to make
03:38 - tons of variation so really if you'd
03:39 - like to make a game inspired by some
03:41 - like ghost of sushima then this pack
03:43 - would be an excellent staring Point next
03:45 - if your game has some knife weapons and
03:47 - you need some animations for that and
03:48 - check out this one you've got over 300
03:50 - Knife Animations so everything from even
03:53 - just standard regular walking idle and
03:55 - crotch animations all while holding a
03:57 - knife you've got those as well as some
03:58 - really nice attacks slashes stabs and
04:00 - Combos and it also has some equip
04:03 - animations and some nice Movement Like
04:04 - vaulting over a crate then if you're
04:06 - making a cyberpunk like game and you
04:08 - need some Neon Lights check out this one
04:10 - basically what makes something cyberpunk
04:12 - versus just sci-fi is really an
04:13 - abundance of Neon Lights this pack
04:15 - includes over a thousand prefabs that's
04:18 - a huge amount you've got lots of signs
04:20 - Holograms and glitchy screens all of it
04:22 - to populate your city and this one also
04:24 - comes in modular parts and if you want
04:26 - the city on top of all these neon signs
04:28 - if so then this St has more packs in the
04:30 - same style or maybe if you're hungry
04:33 - then here's some gorgeous Japanese food
04:35 - these are some really delicious looking
04:37 - models they are nice and stylized but
04:39 - not too cartoony you've got some rice
04:41 - some Ramen and a bunch of things that
04:43 - I'm really not familiar with there's a
04:45 - 150 Assets in this pack and this da has
04:47 - a bunch more packs in the same style so
04:49 - if you'd like to make some kind of
04:51 - Japanese restaurant tycoon game if so
04:53 - then this would be a really great
04:54 - starting point or maybe you're working
04:56 - on some shooting game if so here are
04:58 - some nice fantasy rifles these are some
05:00 - very strange very unique models they
05:03 - look mechanical and also a little bit
05:04 - organic some of them look almost
05:06 - religious or something so seems like a
05:08 - little bit of a Warhammer Vibe others
05:11 - look like they could belong to some Orcs
05:12 - from World of Warcraft so it's a very
05:15 - strange pack but if you want to make
05:16 - your game send out and this looks like
05:18 - it would be great or if inste of weapons
05:20 - you need some Vehicles check out this
05:21 - one personally I quite like the style
05:23 - it's nice and cute all very rounded this
05:25 - one is a pre- giant pack with tons of
05:27 - variation you've got some regular cars
05:29 - some cop cars there's some industry
05:31 - Vehicles some taxi racing hot rods and a
05:34 - bunch more looking at this one reminds
05:35 - me of playing the game Micro Machines
05:37 - when I was a kid this would be a great
05:38 - pack for making a game just like that
05:40 - one then if you're more into a realistic
05:42 - style if so then look at this Victorian
05:44 - menion my iMed reaction is this looks
05:46 - like a house straight out of Resident
05:47 - Evil personally I always find this style
05:49 - very spooky this kind of Victorian thing
05:52 - it always scraps me out so this would be
05:54 - perfect for some kind of horror game but
05:55 - really horror is all about lighting so
05:57 - if you take exactly this if you put this
05:59 - this house with some nice natural
06:00 - lighting it would actually look quite
06:02 - gorgeous then if you need some icons but
06:04 - in 3D check out this one making 3D icons
06:07 - can sometimes look better than 2D
06:09 - especially because makes them easier to
06:11 - animate so these are great for things
06:13 - like weapon or item pickups or really
06:14 - just to make your UI send out a little
06:16 - bit more this one is a nice pack with
06:18 - 100 icons you've got some chests locks
06:21 - gears weapons and of course a bunch of
06:23 - exclamation points for all your quests
06:25 - next if you watch Dune and you wanted to
06:27 - make a game just like it if so here's a
06:29 - sand to get you started it looks very
06:31 - aggressive very nasty this one is a
06:33 - super high-end model this Dev really
06:35 - excels at making a realistic Style with
06:37 - some gorgeous super high quality
06:39 - textures this creature can be either
06:41 - giant or small and it includes 20
06:43 - animations for you to play with then
06:45 - here's some really cool looking Androids
06:47 - this one reminds me of the movie chappie
06:49 - that was a fun movie it's a great
06:51 - highquality model with six different
06:52 - skins it says the model is rigged
06:54 - although I'm not sure if it's a humanoid
06:56 - rig either way it looks really great and
06:58 - comes with a bunch of weapons then for
07:00 - some effects here are some map markers
07:02 - these are really great for any kind of
07:04 - RTS game or maybe even something like
07:06 - Diablo so a top down action game or
07:09 - perhaps these could also be great in a
07:10 - game kind of like hell divers you could
07:12 - use that to Showcase some kind of air
07:14 - strike location then if you need an
07:16 - underground map check out this one this
07:17 - one looks really perfect for some kind
07:19 - of game inspired by aliens or maybe just
07:22 - a fun map for some fun multiplayer
07:24 - shooting game it looks like a pretty
07:25 - large level so you can just use the demo
07:27 - scene as is or build your own then
07:30 - here's a cool generic anime guy with a
07:32 - sword it's a pretty nice design it's
07:34 - generic but it does look the part this
07:36 - could be really great in some kind of
07:38 - jrpg game only difficulty would be
07:40 - finding other characters that match this
07:42 - style but perhaps you could use this in
07:44 - a game kind of like Devil M cry and if
07:46 - so you would only need to find some
07:47 - monsters next here's a really cool
07:49 - looking effect pack this one is all
07:51 - about chain skills so immediately of
07:53 - course I would say this looks inspired
07:55 - by scorpion for Mortal Kombat I can
07:57 - almost hear that get over here line it's
07:59 - got a nice variety of attacks from
08:01 - simple to complex so definitely a very
08:03 - Niche thing but if you need some chain
08:05 - then this looks really great or perhaps
08:07 - you just need an entire stylized Island
08:09 - if so look at this one it looks really
08:11 - gorgeous I especially love the top down
08:13 - view a few months ago I played
08:14 - Desperados 3 and this looks like the
08:16 - perfect environment for a mission in
08:18 - that game you could just add some
08:19 - characters control them from a top down
08:21 - perspective Implement some skills add
08:23 - some enemies and with that you have a
08:25 - gorgeous level or of course just go down
08:27 - into first person and build your own of
08:29 - Thieves all right so those are my top 20
