01:21 - starting off with the latest cyti asset
01:23 - called Dark Fantasy right away I love
01:25 - this one I must say my favorite theme of
01:27 - pretty much anything is basically
01:29 - medieval fantasy so basically Lord of
01:31 - the Rings and yep for that this one is
01:33 - absolutely perfect it has got their
01:35 - signature excellent style this is one of
01:37 - those massive packs with over 600 unique
01:39 - prefabs there's lots of characters
01:42 - character attachments there's tons of
01:43 - props environment weapons and even some
01:45 - modular buildings naturally you can
01:47 - expand this even further with some of
01:49 - their similar packs like for example the
01:50 - also excellent Elven Realms pack then if
01:53 - that's a bit too dark and you want
01:54 - something a bit more Jolly here's a
01:56 - really nice dinosaur pack it's got some
01:58 - very cute cartoony creatures and if cute
02:00 - is what you need then these come in all
02:02 - shapes and sizes including from fully
02:04 - grown to Tiny adorable babies so right
02:06 - away looking at this makes me want to
02:08 - make some kind of zoo tycoon game where
02:09 - you can breed and grow dinosaurs one
02:11 - game I loved as a kid was called safari
02:13 - Tycoon I'd love to make something like
02:15 - that with a pack like this one it
02:17 - includes 64 dinosaurs all of them with 6
02:19 - anation and all sharing just one texture
02:22 - next for some particle effects here's a
02:24 - really nice one with a bunch of them
02:26 - that are meant for characters they are
02:28 - made with the VFX W so they look
02:30 - absolutely excellent all the effects
02:32 - apply perfectly to the mesh so as the
02:34 - character moves and animates the effects
02:36 - follow along with it the fire effect
02:38 - looks absolutely excellent the smoke
02:40 - effect also looks great following the
02:41 - movement perfectly they all have tons of
02:44 - parameters so you can get them looking
02:45 - exactly as you need them then if you
02:47 - need a super high quality weapon check
02:49 - out this one it's technically just one
02:51 - weapon but in reality it's all modular
02:53 - so you can make it look like many
02:54 - different unique weapons the models are
02:56 - extremely detailed with some 4K high
02:59 - resolution texture
03:00 - all the parts are separated which also
03:02 - makes it animation ready so you can very
03:04 - easily animate any single part it also
03:06 - includes a variety of grips stocks
03:08 - magnifiers muzzles and more if you want
03:10 - you can look at my own weapon attachment
03:12 - system tutorial to see how you could add
03:14 - something like this to your game next
03:16 - for something a bit more fun here are
03:17 - some dance moves and yep it's exactly
03:20 - what you expect this could be a great
03:22 - addition if you have some sort of scene
03:23 - in your game that is inside a nightclub
03:26 - and you basically need some background
03:27 - characters to be doing something or
03:29 - perhaps this could also be useful if
03:31 - you're making some DDR or Just Dance
03:33 - inspired game definitely a unique pack
03:35 - but if you need some club dance moves
03:37 - then yep there it is then if you'd like
03:39 - to make some kind of factory game here
03:40 - is a nice bag to help you get starting
03:42 - it contains a whole bunch of machines
03:44 - and belts it's a pretty cheap Pack so
03:46 - it's a perfect starting point you've got
03:48 - six unique machines all of them look
03:50 - really nice all of them with some great
03:52 - animations they look really nice and
03:54 - Casual so nothing too serious and if you
03:56 - like this style then this dev has a ton
03:58 - more in a similar Style if you need some
04:00 - UI check out this wooden pixel art pack
04:03 - it's got lots of icons backgrounds
04:04 - frames buttons and Sliders all of them
04:07 - looking really wooden exactly as you
04:09 - expect so I could see this being great
04:11 - for some kind of forest tycoon game or
04:13 - perhaps simply something like an old
04:15 - school MMO those used to have some UI
04:17 - sort of like this one then from
04:19 - something pixel art to something a lot
04:21 - more futuristic here is a Sci-Fi heavy
04:23 - station it's a really really high
04:25 - quality model it includes both the
04:27 - exterior and the interior you've got
04:29 - lots of rooms displays beds you've got a
04:32 - mes hle a command center and a bunch
04:34 - more so basically if you've been playing
04:35 - Starfield and you want to make something
04:37 - similar to it then this would be a great
04:39 - fit then for some more cozy Interiors
04:42 - here is a giant mega pack this one is
04:44 - definitely huge over 350 interior assets
04:47 - all of them look really nice and cozy
04:49 - you've got plenty of sofas a bunch of
04:51 - desks cupboards appliances and more so
04:54 - this would obviously be perfect for some
04:56 - kind of game inspired by The Sims now if
04:58 - that's a bit too calm for you you then
04:59 - check out this awesome fighter animation
05:01 - pack you've got some really great
05:03 - animations there are some regular
05:05 - realistic ones like some basic punches
05:07 - and then you've got some that go really
05:09 - crazy you could just take this add some
05:11 - particle effects and some flying enemies
05:13 - and you can make something really
05:14 - awesome with this one and again this Dev
05:16 - is also really prolific so if you like
05:18 - this pack then this dev has tons more
05:20 - next if your game has character
05:21 - customization then check out this one
05:23 - basically it's a modular character
05:25 - creator this pack is actually a bundle
05:27 - which includes several others so for a
05:29 - total of over 2,000 modular pieces
05:32 - that's pretty much a near infinite
05:33 - endless amount of variation being low
05:36 - poly also means you can easily recolor
05:38 - eyesee them for even more variation the
05:40 - characters can look either regular or
05:42 - very cyberpunk like it includes all the
05:44 - parts as well as some pre-made icons for
05:46 - all of them so that alone really saves
05:48 - you a bunch of time then for a single
05:50 - really high quality character check out
05:52 - this demon creature certainly looks very
05:54 - demon-like I could see this being taken
05:56 - straight from the most recent Doom it's
05:58 - a super high qual quity model basically
06:00 - if you have a game with demons then this
06:02 - would fit perfectly next for some more
06:04 - particles here is a pack with a ton of
06:06 - SZ explosions personally I always love
06:08 - SZ explosions they always look so good
06:11 - this one has 37 prefabs everything from
06:14 - some regular explosions a bunch of air
06:16 - explosions and even some really intense
06:19 - nukes so for example if you'd like to
06:21 - make a stylized Oppenheimer game then
06:23 - maybe this would be perfect for you this
06:25 - Dev Gabriel he has tons more VFX pack so
06:28 - if you like this style then check out
06:29 - his full page or perhaps you're into
06:31 - something a bit more pirate like if so
06:33 - check out this one it's a really nice
06:35 - pirate Village quite a large pack with
06:37 - hundreds of props dozens of characters
06:40 - and some really great looking ships this
06:42 - one looks great in both daytime and
06:43 - nighttime if you're working on a 2d side
06:46 - scroller check out these awesome
06:47 - cityscape backgrounds it's got lots of
06:49 - layers for a really nice Parallax effect
06:52 - I can see this one being perfect for
06:53 - some kind of beat them up game where you
06:55 - have a section where you fight on a car
06:57 - or really just could be a simple cut
06:59 - scene seen on a story heavy 2D game or
07:01 - maybe you need something in a steampunk
07:03 - style if so check out this one it's
07:05 - another huge pack with over a th000
07:07 - objects obviously it's got lots of gears
07:09 - and some very all looking objects so
07:12 - this is one of those packs where with
07:13 - all of these parts you can build an
07:15 - entire huge world with just this one
07:16 - pack then if you need a spooky Dark
07:19 - Forest check out this one it's very high
07:21 - quality this is an hrp scene it's a Prem
07:24 - massive scene with some outside and some
07:26 - Interiors of some catacombs or a spooky
07:29 - church so I could see this one being
07:31 - great for some kind of game inspired by
07:32 - Elden ring next for a nice stylized
07:35 - character here is a great Anubis great
07:37 - looking cartoony character so this could
07:39 - be taken straight from the game Smite it
07:41 - includes a character and over two dozen
07:43 - animations so this could be either your
07:45 - player or maybe some enemy then if
07:47 - you're making something with some
07:49 - highend visuals themed in ancient Rome
07:51 - then check out this one it's a gorgeous
07:53 - looking very high in scene it's a temple
07:56 - SL city with a bunch of fire in
07:58 - construction basic it looks like
08:00 - something bad has just happened looking
08:02 - at this one it looks like this one could
08:03 - be taken straight from the gorgeous game
08:05 - rice and of Rome which personally I
08:07 - really enjoy that game but if you're
08:08 - more into sci-fi then check out this
