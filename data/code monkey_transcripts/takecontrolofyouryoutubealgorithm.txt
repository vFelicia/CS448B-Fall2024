00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - so i make a ton of videos on a lot of
00:03 - topics
00:04 - i'm always trying to give you some good
00:05 - information so you can become better at
00:07 - making your own games and making your
00:08 - dreams a reality
00:10 - that's my goal with pretty much every
00:11 - video that i make now one simple
00:13 - question
00:14 - did you see my recent videos unlike the
00:15 - inventory tetris or the cleaning
00:17 - minigame or the house building system
00:19 - chances are there are some videos that
00:21 - would be very useful to you but the
00:22 - youtube algorithm simply didn't
00:24 - recommend them
00:25 - so you missed out on those videos which
00:26 - means you missed out on some knowledge
00:28 - that could help you make your games even
00:29 - better
00:30 - or give you some ideas for your next
00:31 - project now just in case you're not
00:33 - familiar with how the youtube algorithm
00:35 - works
00:36 - essentially the more videos of a channel
00:37 - that you watch the more they get
00:39 - recommended to you
00:40 - so if you click on every single video of
00:42 - a channel then youtube won't keep
00:43 - recommending
00:44 - it but at the same time if you don't
00:46 - watch one or two videos then youtube
00:48 - might stop recommending that channel
00:49 - altogether regardless if you're a
00:51 - subscriber or not now in this channel i
00:53 - try very hard to cover on lots of topics
00:55 - to keep the channel interesting
00:57 - so i do tons of video topics in
00:58 - different formats and i assume that some
01:01 - people are more interested in one topic
01:02 - and others prefer a different one
01:04 - so i don't expect everyone to be
01:06 - interested in every single video that i
01:08 - put out
01:08 - so let's say for example you're someone
01:10 - who really likes watching the tutorial
01:12 - videos but you're not really that
01:14 - interested in the monthly game releases
01:15 - or the asset review videos
01:17 - if that's the case then because you
01:19 - didn't watch some videos
01:20 - then youtube is less likely to recommend
01:23 - the next tutorial video that i put out
01:24 - which means again you might miss out on
01:26 - some knowledge that could help you
01:28 - greatly in making your next game
01:30 - so that's the problem and in order to
01:31 - try to solve that problem i've made a
01:33 - simple update to the website
01:35 - you can log in and go to your account
01:36 - settings and manage email notifications
01:39 - the goal with this is essentially to put
01:40 - the power in your hands so rather than
01:42 - relying on youtube making the decisions
01:44 - for you
01:45 - and only showing you some videos and not
01:46 - showing others you can instead make sure
01:48 - you're always notified and then you can
01:50 - decide if you want to watch each video
01:52 - or not
01:53 - you can set it up to receive the normal
01:55 - monthly newsletter where i highlight
01:56 - some of the videos for that month as
01:58 - well as any new announcements and news
02:01 - or you can receive one email each week
02:03 - with that week's videos
02:04 - or get an email when each video goes
02:07 - live you can get notified of new
02:09 - announcements like new courses new games
02:11 - or assets
02:12 - and specifically on the live streams
02:13 - this might be very useful since so many
02:15 - people seem to miss them
02:17 - or if you just want to make sure you
02:18 - never miss anything just select them all
02:20 - and then you decide
02:21 - so like i said the goal with this is to
02:23 - put the power in your hands i really put
02:25 - in a ton of work into making lots of
02:26 - videos to help you on your game
02:28 - development journey
02:29 - and it sucks that sometimes i might make
02:31 - a video that could very well be perfect
02:32 - just for you
02:33 - but if youtube doesn't recommend it then
02:35 - you might never see it
02:36 - so hopefully with this simple update
02:38 - those kinds of issues won't happen again
02:40 - and you get to decide what videos you
02:42 - want to watch
02:43 - instead of having youtube decide for you
02:45 - alright hope that helps
02:46 - check out the website to set your
02:48 - preferences stay tuned for
02:49 - lots of exciting new videos thank you
02:51 - for watching and i'll see you next time
03:04 - [Music]
03:08 - you
