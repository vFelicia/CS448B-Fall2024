00:00 - here's a quick empty tip one very
00:01 - important concept in writing clean code
00:04 - is to never use magic numbers
00:06 - magic numbers are numbers which are used
00:08 - without being clear what they're doing
00:10 - so over here i have some code changing
00:12 - the position and then doing a distance
00:14 - check
00:14 - so i'm changing the position by 20 and
00:16 - testing for the distance by 5.
00:18 - this is some simple code so you might be
00:20 - able to figure out what it means but
00:21 - still it should be clear what the code
00:23 - is doing
00:23 - the 20 in here means the movement speed
00:25 - that's why it's changing the position
00:27 - and multiplying by the direction
00:29 - and the 5 here what it means is the
00:30 - attack distance so if the distance to
00:32 - the target is less than 5 units then he
00:34 - will attack
00:34 - we can make this code much more readable
00:36 - by simply defining variables for these
00:38 - numbers so we simple foiled for the
00:40 - attack distance and a float for the move
00:41 - speed
00:42 - if any of these numbers are used
00:43 - elsewhere then we should define them as
00:45 - either class variables or as constants
00:47 - with this simple change now it's much
00:48 - more clear that we're moving the unit
00:50 - and then testing if the target is within
00:51 - the attack distance
00:52 - always remember to keep your code clean
00:54 - by defining clear variables instead of
00:56 - using magic numbers subscribe for more
