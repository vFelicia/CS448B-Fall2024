00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're continuing to
00:03 - create a graph in unity we're going to
00:05 - add some customizable labels to our axis
00:08 - separators let's get started
00:12 - so here I have the graph from the
00:14 - previous video with my data points and
00:16 - the axis separators right now the x-axis
00:20 - is displaying the index of each data
00:22 - point and on the y-axis it's displaying
00:25 - the value of that data point in seven
00:28 - let's customize the label text on the
00:29 - x-axis to say something like day one day
00:32 - two day three and so on and on the
00:34 - y-axis let's display the value as a
00:37 - dollar amount so we previously created
00:40 - this graph here which is displaying all
00:42 - of our values our values are represented
00:44 - in code as a list of integers so now for
00:47 - a bit of Polish and let's customize the
00:49 - unlabeled text so let's say in here
00:51 - instead of posting the index we want to
00:53 - say something different like day 1 day 2
00:55 - day 3 and so on and here and let's say
00:58 - we want to display it in dollars instead
01:00 - of just values so in here on my show
01:03 - graph I'm also going to receive two
01:05 - funks the funks are in using system now
01:09 - a func is a delegate that returns
01:11 - something so in this case we're going to
01:14 - use a func to get a label for my x axis
01:17 - the x axis is in an INT and it will
01:21 - return a string and let's call it get
01:24 - axis label x and make the same thing for
01:28 - my y axis y except this one takes a
01:33 - float let's make these values optional
01:36 - so we still have the default
01:38 - functionality so let's set equals known
01:41 - and here let's validate our inputs so if
01:44 - get axis label x if it is no then let's
01:48 - do the same thing we were doing
01:49 - previously so we're going to create a
01:51 - get axis label X which will be a
01:54 - delegate that receives an int and it's
01:57 - going to return a string now the string
02:00 - that it will return in the case of our
02:02 - default behavior we have in here just
02:04 - the I dot two strength so go into in
02:08 - here and return the I dot two string so
02:11 - this is the default behavior in case we
02:13 - send null in here for the wine let's
02:16 - copy this set the Y which actually takes
02:19 - a float and for my Y you can see down
02:24 - here this is what I
02:25 - displaying by the phone so this is what
02:28 - I'm going to go in here and display we
02:32 - are rounding the float value and this
02:34 - point as a string
02:36 - okay so let's use these functions when
02:38 - we go down here so for my label X
02:40 - instead of displaying the eye I'm going
02:43 - to use that func to send it the eye and
02:45 - it will return a string and down here
02:48 - when I'm making the Y separators when I
02:51 - set the text let's make the get access
02:54 - label on Y and I'm going to send it the
02:56 - value which is the normalized value x dy
03:00 - maximum okay so we have set up the
03:03 - defaults to function exactly the same as
03:05 - previously so let's go back into our
03:07 - scene make sure everything is working
03:08 - exactly the same and there you have it 0
03:11 - 1 2 3 0 10 20 ok great now let's
03:14 - actually apply some funks so we can
03:17 - modify it don't leave on tags
03:19 - so appear on my show graph for my gap
03:23 - axis and label X I'm going to receive an
03:25 - int and I'm going to return some string
03:28 - then I'm going to have the get X is
03:31 - labeled Y which will receive a float and
03:33 - return another string now in here for my
03:36 - wine let's say I wanted to say de and
03:39 - then the I plus 1 so it doesn't start
03:42 - with 0 so the first one won't say the 1
03:45 - day 2 day 3 and so on and for my
03:47 - floating here and let's say I want to
03:49 - say dollars and then still the way math
03:52 - F dot Brown 2 went of my foot okay so we
03:57 - should now be correctly displaying our
03:59 - custom labels as we want and yep there
04:02 - you go the accent label is now saying
04:04 - day 1 day 2 day 3 day 4 and so on and
04:07 - for my y axis it is displaying a dollar
04:09 - amount so there you have it we have
04:12 - added the ability to customize the
04:13 - labels in our axes this way you can
04:16 - clearly describe whatever information
04:17 - you're trying to graph in the next video
04:20 - we're going to automatically modify the
04:22 - scale of our graph based on our list of
04:24 - values as always you can download the
04:27 - project files in utilities from unity
04:29 - code monkey comm if you have any
04:31 - questions post them in the comments and
04:32 - I'll do my best to answer them ok
04:34 - see you next time
