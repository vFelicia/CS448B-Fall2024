00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - the asset source full of awesome tools
00:03 - and assets help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some of the highlights
00:09 - that were released in august 2021 in
00:12 - this first video i will be covering a
00:13 - list of free assets and in the next ones
00:15 - i will be covering paid assets and tools
00:17 - check out the phone plan list to see all
00:19 - of the highlights every month you might
00:20 - find something that would be perfect for
00:22 - whatever project you're currently
00:23 - working on let me know in the comments
00:25 - if you pick up any of these and what you
00:26 - intend to do with them and by the way
00:28 - check out my own assets on the store so
00:30 - far i've made the free key door system
00:32 - which is a super simple way to add keys
00:33 - and doors to your games
00:35 - and the mouse cursor system pro which is
00:37 - a very easy to use tool to help you
00:39 - create some custom animated cursors to
00:41 - really make your game stand out alright
00:43 - so starting off with a pretty impressive
00:44 - sci-fi police pack
00:46 - really high quality and tons of objects
00:48 - for a free pack it's in a low poly style
00:50 - so the characters look like playstation
00:52 - 1 models
00:53 - so it contains characters buildings
00:55 - vehicles weapons and tons of props could
00:57 - be great for a heist game or maybe a
00:59 - starting point for an open world game
01:01 - something like gta
01:03 - then if you need tons of medieval
01:04 - characters also in a low poly style
01:06 - there's this pack
01:08 - they are modular so you can create tons
01:10 - and tons of variation
01:11 - if you like this style then this
01:13 - developer has a bunch of other character
01:14 - packs and they are all using the same
01:16 - rig so you can easily mix and match to
01:18 - get even more variation next up an rpg
01:21 - combat system
01:22 - so this is a great starting point you
01:24 - just drag and drop and you have a
01:26 - working character with movement jump
01:28 - dash and attack supports both keyboard
01:30 - and gamepad inputs and it even includes
01:32 - a simple ai enemy so if you have a quick
01:35 - rpg idea you'd like to try out then this
01:37 - would be a great super fast starting
01:39 - point or maybe you need a quick
01:41 - environment to try out here is a nice
01:43 - desert it's a very large map with a
01:45 - bunch of rocks cliffs and dry vegetation
01:48 - includes 14 prefabs so you can expand
01:50 - upon it or reuse it in any other scene
01:53 - import this whenever you want to test
01:54 - some game idea but you want something
01:56 - that looks a bit better than just a
01:57 - boring plane
01:59 - for an interesting tool here is the
02:00 - quick object replacer tool normally when
02:03 - prototyping your game ideas you probably
02:05 - tend to use basic shapes so just a bunch
02:07 - of spheres capsules cubes and so on
02:10 - eventually you do want to switch it out
02:12 - for some proper meshes now doing that
02:14 - manually is very tedious so this simple
02:16 - tool lets you select the objects you
02:18 - want to replace select the object you
02:20 - want to replace them with and just swap
02:21 - them all with a click of a button
02:23 - so it's simple and it does exactly what
02:25 - it's supposed to do next up here's a
02:27 - simple free bicycle looks really nice
02:30 - very sleek very clean design
02:32 - maybe it could be a vehicle in your open
02:34 - world game or maybe use it in a downhill
02:36 - prototype also comes with a ramp so
02:39 - maybe to make some tricks as well as a
02:41 - finish line then for some nice textures
02:43 - here's a great pack includes five
02:45 - materials all of them with tons of maps
02:47 - so the final result looks really good
02:49 - not just a flat visual you've got some
02:52 - wood and a bunch of brick types next up
02:54 - if you want a character creator with a
02:56 - realistic style check this one out it's
02:58 - a male model with a humanoid rig and it
03:01 - includes a bit of customization
03:03 - this developer also has tons more really
03:05 - high-end models so if you like this
03:07 - style then check it out or maybe you
03:09 - need a really cool effect for your sword
03:11 - slash here's a great looking one it's a
03:13 - mesh so it works great on both 2d and 3d
03:16 - games
03:17 - just swap out the material with a
03:19 - different color and it looks completely
03:20 - different and finally another
03:22 - interesting tool this lets you define a
03:24 - bunch of voice types then you populate
03:27 - it with a bunch of audio clips for each
03:29 - voice and through code you play the clip
03:31 - for that selected voice i can see this
03:34 - being very useful for something like an
03:36 - open world game where you have lots of
03:37 - npcs all of them saying the same ai
03:40 - barks but with different voice types
03:42 - also this has integration with an ai
03:44 - voice generator which could also be very
03:46 - useful alright so those are my top 10
03:48 - free new assets on the unity asset store
03:50 - for august 2021 there's links to all of
03:53 - them in the description
