00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and this is a prequel tutorial over here
00:04 - let's learn how to change a character
00:05 - visual this tutorial is pretty general
00:07 - and applies to just about any controller
00:09 - but specifically here i will be using
00:11 - the official third-person star asset
00:13 - made by unity this one is a really
00:15 - awesome controller it's commonly free i
00:16 - highly recommend it i covered it in
00:18 - detail in another video
00:20 - here's the 10 second answer for how to
00:21 - swap the character you change the skin
00:23 - mesh render then you change the bones
00:25 - and you use the avatar for that new
00:27 - character that's it
00:28 - now here's the longer answer with some
00:30 - common pitfalls and errors
00:32 - so here i've got the unity star as
00:34 - controller with the included robot
00:36 - character
00:37 - now of course when using this controller
00:39 - chances are you want to use a custom
00:40 - character that makes sense for your game
00:43 - so over here i've got a character from
00:44 - the polygon cinti pack this pack was
00:47 - free a bunch of times so chances are you
00:48 - already have it alternatively another
00:50 - place where you can get characters is
00:52 - from miximo which is a free website i
00:54 - also cover that process in another video
00:55 - so here i've got another character that
00:57 - i grab for free from maximo all right so
00:59 - now let's swap out our controller to any
01:01 - of these two characters now if we
01:03 - inspect we can see how it's set up so
01:05 - we've got the player armature with all
01:06 - the various logic scripts
01:08 - also note how this one has the animator
01:11 - then if we look inside it inside this
01:13 - geometry game object we've got the
01:14 - armature mesh so this is the actual skin
01:16 - mesh render and then also next to it
01:19 - we've got the skeleton which are all the
01:20 - bones so let's say i want to swap out
01:22 - this character for this one from the
01:23 - cindy pack now there's only three things
01:25 - you need to do you need to change the
01:27 - skin mesh render you need to change the
01:29 - bones and you need to assign the avatar
01:31 - for that new mesh
01:32 - okay so let's try doing that now first
01:35 - find the character that you want from
01:36 - the project files so on some asset packs
01:39 - some of them come with the prefab others
01:40 - just have the fbx file either one is
01:43 - fine you can just select either of them
01:44 - and just drag the scene like this when
01:46 - you do you have the character object and
01:49 - then over here is the point where a lot
01:50 - of people get wrong myself as well i
01:52 - have this issue all the time
01:54 - so you want to use the animator from the
01:57 - third person controller but you want to
01:59 - use the visual from this one and the
02:00 - visual itself is of course composed of
02:02 - the skin mesh render and the various
02:04 - bones so you might think that one way of
02:05 - getting these two objects would be to
02:06 - just duplicate it so just ctrl d then
02:09 - just drag these new ones over there onto
02:11 - that one make sure transform is all on
02:13 - zero zero so they match get rid of the
02:16 - previous ones
02:17 - and finally of course remember to assign
02:19 - the avatar that relates to this mesh so
02:22 - let's go into the mesh grab the avatar
02:24 - for this new visual and just assign this
02:27 - one okay we've done all three steps we
02:29 - swapped the skin mesh render we swapped
02:31 - the bones and we assigned the correct
02:32 - avatar for this mesh
02:34 - however if we hit on play
02:36 - and nope the character is stuck in t
02:38 - pose so there are no animations now the
02:40 - reason as to why this is happening it's
02:42 - actually quite simple over here on the
02:44 - animator we did assign the new avatar
02:46 - but if we try to open this avatar over
02:49 - here we can see that this avatar had all
02:51 - of the various bones assigned but they
02:53 - are assigned you can see over here for
02:54 - example the bones start with root
02:57 - whereas if we go and see which one we
02:59 - just placed this one is named root and
03:00 - then has the one because we duplicated
03:02 - this game object so the way the avatar
03:05 - works is based on the exact game object
03:06 - name so since we duplicated it at this
03:09 - one at the end because of that the
03:10 - animator cannot find the bones because
03:12 - the name is not exactly what the avatar
03:13 - is expecting so if you have this issue
03:15 - then it's pretty simple just make sure
03:17 - the bones game object is named exactly
03:18 - as it was on the original character so
03:20 - you can either check the original
03:22 - character and see it was named root or
03:23 - again you can look inside the avatar and
03:25 - over here see yep the bones should be
03:27 - named root
03:29 - so if we just rename this one to that
03:31 - also another quick thing that should
03:32 - have happened automatically when you
03:34 - duplicated is if you go on the skin mesh
03:36 - render over here make sure the root bone
03:38 - transform make sure this one is the
03:39 - correct reference okay so do that make
03:41 - sure the name is exact and now if we run
03:43 - play
03:44 - if there you go now the animation zoo
03:46 - perfectly worked so we correctly
03:47 - retargeted all of our animations all of
03:49 - them work perfectly with our new mesh so
03:51 - i can move around with my new character
03:52 - and everything works perfectly alright
03:55 - awesome okay so now let's see the
03:56 - process for a free character from miximo
03:59 - now like i covered in the maximo video
04:01 - you select the character and you
04:02 - download it for free then you just add
04:04 - it onto your project files so here is a
04:06 - character that i downloaded and first
04:08 - thing you need to do is select the
04:10 - character so the fbx object
04:12 - then go over here onto the rig tab and
04:14 - under animation type make sure it's set
04:16 - to humanoid so select humanoid and click
04:18 - on apply with that done you can now
04:20 - again just drag the object onto the game
04:23 - scene
04:24 - and again you've got the object with the
04:25 - animator with the avatar inside we've
04:27 - got the skin mesh render and inside
04:29 - we've got a reference to all the various
04:31 - bones so again how to swap out our
04:33 - character controller let's do the exact
04:34 - same thing so let's duplicate these ones
04:36 - let's drag it on to the new object let's
04:39 - place them on zero zero zero let's get
04:41 - rid of the previous visual then on the
04:44 - skin mesh renderer make sure the
04:45 - reference is correct so it's the one
04:47 - we've duplicated and again make sure the
04:49 - name is correct so this one get rid of
04:51 - that and the final thing is assigning
04:52 - the avatar so let's drag the avatar that
04:54 - we downloaded assign it there and that's
04:57 - it and yep over here is my character
04:59 - download from maximo and yep it's
05:00 - working perfectly with all the
05:02 - animations with the controller
05:03 - everything works perfectly
05:05 - alright great so here are all three
05:07 - characters working perfectly over here
05:09 - is the original robot
05:11 - then the character from the asset store
05:14 - and finally the one downloaded for free
05:15 - off miximo
05:17 - so once again just follow that checklist
05:19 - make sure you follow all the steps make
05:21 - sure the character is humanoid make sure
05:23 - the skin mesh renderer has the correct
05:24 - reference to the bones make sure the
05:26 - bones are named correctly swap out the
05:28 - avatar and everything will work alright
05:31 - hope that's useful check out these
05:32 - videos to learn some more thanks to
05:34 - these awesome patreon supporters for
05:36 - making these videos possible thank you
