00:02 - testing your game you will probably
00:03 - modify some parameters while playing it
00:05 - for example let's say while playing you
00:06 - think this transform should really be on
00:08 - this position instead
00:10 - but when you stop playing these values
00:11 - get reset so one thing you can do is
00:13 - memorize these values or take a
00:14 - screenshot and write them manually
00:16 - or a much better approach is to right
00:18 - click on the component and copy

00:20 - then you stop the game and then right
00:22 - click and paste component values
