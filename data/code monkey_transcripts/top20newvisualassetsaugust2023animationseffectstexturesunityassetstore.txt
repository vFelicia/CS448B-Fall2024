00:55 - this style is perfect this one is a huge
00:58 - pack features over 2 and prefabs
01:01 - everything from Modular Buildings
01:03 - animals characters and tons of plants
01:05 - this would be the perfect pack if you'd
01:07 - like to make a quick farming minigame or
01:09 - maybe you're working on something a bit
01:10 - more hardcore if so here's a really nice
01:12 - Katana animation pack great animations
01:15 - they are sandwich but not too outlandish
01:17 - features some simple slashes and some
01:19 - really impressive moves it's also even
01:21 - got air attacks so you could use this
01:23 - for something more grounded like ghosts
01:25 - of tsushima or maybe something inspired
01:27 - by Devil May Cry and if you have Katana
01:29 - animations you need some Samurai visual
01:31 - here's a great looking one super high
01:34 - resolution extremely high quality
01:35 - character this one could really be taken
01:37 - straight from Ghost of tsushima the
01:39 - character also has 80 blend shapes on
01:41 - the face so you can make some
01:42 - expressions or even use it in some
01:44 - real-time AR apps next here's a pack
01:46 - with a ton of gorgeous skyboxes with
01:48 - environments this is a great way to make
01:50 - your game look so much better with very
01:52 - little effort just add a gorgeous Skybox
01:55 - and these also come with some
01:56 - environment images so just with this one
01:58 - and your world will immediately look
02:00 - great or maybe you need some hyper
02:02 - realistic explosions if so check out
02:04 - this one these are Olympic explosions
02:06 - which makes them look really extremely
02:08 - smooth the smoke looks a little bit too
02:10 - thick but the Fireballs do look perfect
02:12 - this is all based on vertex colors so it
02:15 - uses no textures these also react on
02:17 - lighting although they will not interact
02:19 - with physics objects then here's a fun
02:21 - one a ton of cartoony emoticons this can
02:24 - be used in either 2D or 3D this town
02:27 - looks really nice nice depth effect in
02:29 - some of those there are some cartoony
02:31 - explosions lots of emotions thought
02:33 - Bubbles and various icons then for
02:36 - something more serious here is a Fantasy
02:38 - Castle environment it's got a very very
02:40 - realistic style these are some really
02:42 - high-end meshes and props I have no idea
02:44 - what you'd call the style is this Gothic
02:46 - or something either way it looks taken
02:48 - straight from some like dark souls or
02:49 - Elden ring if instead you need some TD
02:51 - here is an isometric pixel art character
02:53 - it looks really nice every angle is
02:56 - included the Sprites are very clearly 3D
02:59 - meshes that were processed with a pixel
03:00 - Shader so that makes for an interesting
03:02 - look this pack has 5 characters each
03:04 - with some nice variations and animations
03:06 - then here's a fun one it's a stunt car
03:09 - racing pack definitely a very unique
03:11 - asset this would be perfect if you're
03:13 - making a car game inspired by something
03:15 - like trackmania or Hot Wheels It's Got
03:17 - Some Loops some jumps and sidebands
03:19 - really a very unique pack then for some
03:22 - tune animations check out this one it's
03:24 - amazing how animations can also have a
03:26 - tune sound but yep that is correct they
03:28 - do look clearly very very toony honestly
03:31 - looking at this one makes me want to
03:32 - replace the red similar animations that
03:34 - I'm using in my upcoming steam game link
03:36 - Guardians these will look a lot more
03:37 - cartoony which would fit the game
03:39 - perfectly looking at the animations
03:40 - applied to tune characters doesn't look
03:42 - really nice then if you need a stylized
03:44 - modular character here's one it features
03:47 - a male and female body types it's a
03:50 - regular humanoid ring so works with any
03:51 - animations it's got multiple eye shapes
03:54 - multiple hairstyles phone outfits shirts
03:56 - and pants so I could see this one being
03:58 - perfect for making something like a Sims
04:00 - game if you want something more near
04:02 - futuristic here is a ton of props and a
04:05 - cyberpunk character it looks very flashy
04:07 - very stylized it's futuristic but not
04:10 - too far in the future it includes a nice
04:12 - character on a really interesting
04:13 - hoverboard then for something more in
04:16 - the past here is a wild west modular
04:18 - pack it's a realistic sound looks really
04:20 - nice looking at this one makes me want
04:22 - to build something inspired by Red Dead
04:24 - it's got lots of modular building Parts
04:26 - signs and props so you can really make
04:28 - your own really nice Western Village
04:29 - then for something scary and cute here
04:32 - is in Little Ghost it's a really nice
04:34 - style spooky but casual perfect for a
04:36 - game inspired by Casper or something
04:38 - like that it includes lots of colors for
04:40 - some very nice variation and even some

05:12 - one it's a Mario style environment it
05:15 - definitely fits that description looking
05:17 - at it for half a second you can only
05:19 - tell this was inspired by Mario so if
05:21 - you'd like to make something that is
05:22 - indeed inspired by the same style as
05:24 - Mario then this would fit perfectly
05:25 - great for making any kind of 3D
