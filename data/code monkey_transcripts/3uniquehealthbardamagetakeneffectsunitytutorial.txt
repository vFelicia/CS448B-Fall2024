00:00 - in this video we're going to create
00:01 - various ways of showing damage taken in
00:03 - a health bar this is a great way for the
00:05 - players to see how much damage he took
00:07 - in the very last hit we're going to make
00:09 - three versions of the effect so you can
00:10 - pick which one best suits your game all
00:12 - right let's begin
00:16 - [Music]
00:21 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:23 - and this channel is all about helping
00:24 - you learn how to make your own games
00:26 - with nf2 torrents made by a professional
00:28 - indie game developer so if you find the
00:30 - video helpful consider subscribing so
00:32 - again here are our three effects over
00:35 - here we have one that fits into nothing
00:37 - so we trigger damage there's the damage
00:39 - part and after a while it fades into
00:41 - nothing then we have this one which
00:43 - shrinks so we take some damage and after
00:46 - a while it shrinks to match the bar and
00:48 - yep there you go and finally have the
00:51 - cut which gets cut from the health bar
00:53 - and after a while falls down and
00:55 - vanishes all three are great effects
00:58 - that add polish to your game so here I
01:01 - am in an empty scene let's start off by
01:03 - making our basic health bar so first we
01:06 - go into the campus and create an empty
01:08 - game object this will be our health bar
01:10 - fail so this will be the one with the
01:13 - fading effect let's add a new UI image
01:17 - inside this will be for our background
01:20 - and on top we have another image for the
01:24 - actual help
01:32 - okay so this is our basic health bar we
01:35 - have the main container then we have a
01:37 - background and then we have a bar with
01:39 - our gradient sprite now in here on the
01:41 - image type let's switch from simple into
01:43 - filmed select horizontal and left to
01:46 - right and just like that we can now
01:48 - modify the fill amount in order to set
01:49 - our bar size okay now let's make a
01:53 - script to handle this health bar so here
01:57 - create a new C sharp script
01:59 - this will be our health bar faint drag
02:03 - it onto the game object and let's write
02:05 - some code okay now in here let's first
02:08 - grab a reference to our image so we make
02:10 - a private void awake to grab our
02:13 - references we define a private image
02:15 - reference for our bar image okay so we
02:23 - have our reference now let's make a nice
02:25 - set health function so we make a Fred
02:27 - boy set he'll and in here we're going to
02:32 - receive a float for the health normalize
02:34 - so we receive a normalized value and all
02:38 - we need to do is go into the bar image
02:39 - set the Philmont to our normalized val
02:42 - and that's pretty much it so now on
02:45 - private void start let's do some testing
02:48 - and here we do set home and let's put it
02:51 - at 80 percent so we pass in point eight
02:54 - okay let's see if the health bar is
02:57 - indeed at 80 percent and if there is the
03:00 - health bar pretty much at 80 percent
03:01 - okay great now in order to make our
03:04 - effects we're going to need a very
03:05 - simple health system so in here a new C
03:08 - sharp script for the health system and
03:12 - now in here I'm going to write a health
03:14 - system very quickly just to make sure
03:15 - that this video is focused on a health
03:17 - bar instead of the health system
03:39 - okay so here it is I have done a video
03:42 - on a health system at health bar so
03:44 - check those out for a more in-depth look
03:45 - into how this works also you can pause
03:48 - the video to write the code if you're
03:49 - following along or you can download the
03:51 - project files from the website in this
03:53 - video all we care is that we have events
03:56 - notifying us when the health changes
03:57 - then here we have a function which
03:59 - returns our corn health normalized and
04:02 - we have functions to heal or damage our
04:04 - health system so this is very basic now
04:07 - let's apply this to our health bar so
04:10 - here on the health bar feed code let's
04:12 - make our testing here on the start so
04:14 - first we're going to create a new health
04:16 - system so we start a new health system
04:20 - with a hundred health and now we set the
04:22 - health instead of being a number we go
04:24 - into the health system when we get the
04:25 - health normalized then in order to make
04:29 - sure the bar updates has the health
04:31 - system takes damage or heals
04:32 - we simply subscribe to the events so the
04:34 - health system subscribe to the undamaged
04:37 - event and here we're going to do the
04:39 - same thing we update the health bar and
04:41 - also subscribe to the health system on
04:44 - heal defense and we do the same thing we
04:47 - update our bar okay okay so that's
04:54 - pretty much it and this should be
04:55 - working let's just run the code to make
04:57 - sure our bar shows up as fully healed
04:59 - any up there it is the bar is that a
05:02 - hundred percent okay great now let's
05:04 - create some buttons so we can test out
05:06 - the healing and damaging in order to
05:09 - create some really quick testing buttons
05:11 - we can use the CMD bar class which is
05:14 - part of the code mock utility as long as
05:18 - you can grab the utilities for free from
05:19 - unity code monkey calm so in that class
05:22 - we have a function where we can easily
05:23 - create a button on UI so it's perfect
05:26 - for testing put it on a certain position
05:31 - so this will be our damage button and
05:33 - then we pass in an action that we want
05:35 - to happen when we click on this button
05:37 - so in this case we want to deal some
05:39 - damage so the action will go into the
05:41 - Health System and cause some damage and
05:45 - then next to it let's make a heal button
05:49 - okay so we should have two nice testing
05:52 - buttons let's see okay here we have our
05:55 - nice testing buttons now if I press on
05:58 - damage yep there you go the health
06:00 - system took damage and the bar does
06:01 - indeed show that damage okay and I can
06:03 - heal and goes back up all right so right
06:07 - now we have a very basic health bar
06:08 - working now it's time to start working
06:11 - on adding our effects so first here in
06:14 - the editor let's think about what we
06:15 - were going to need for this bar we're
06:18 - trying to make the fade effect so we
06:21 - want the bar to take damage and have
06:22 - another bar behind it showing the damage
06:24 - different then that bar will start to
06:27 - fade after some time so for that we can
06:30 - simply duplicate our bar this will be
06:32 - our damaged bar instead of using this
06:35 - texture let's just make it in white okay
06:39 - so this will be our damaged bar image we
06:42 - just have a bar working example like the
06:44 - health bar except it says behind it and
06:46 - essentially this will show this amount
06:48 - and then after a while it won't start to
06:50 - fade and then if we get hit again it
06:52 - will calculate the same fill amount and
06:54 - so on and so forth okay so now we can go
06:56 - back into the code and here the first
06:59 - thing we're going to need is a reference
07:00 - to our damage bar image now let's also
07:06 - store the current color when we grab our
07:08 - reference and for starters we're going
07:15 - to start off with the Alpha at zero so
07:17 - that the damage bar is invisible and we
07:22 - also need a timer in order to know when
07:24 - we should start to fade so up here we
07:26 - make a private hole for the damaged
07:29 - health fade time
07:32 - so this is the current timer when this
07:36 - is under zero then we're going to lower
07:38 - the Alpha so that means we also need a
07:40 - maximum timer so for that let's define
07:42 - it as a constant so here we do a private
07:45 - on squad for the damage how fade timer
07:49 - max and four stars and let's put it at
07:52 - one second so the bar will be visible
07:55 - for one second and then start to fade
07:57 - away so with all these we have all the
07:59 - elements to be able to create our effect
08:02 - so in order to do the effect let's
08:04 - create a private roid update and first
08:08 - we test if the image is visible by
08:10 - testing the current alpha so we test if
08:13 - the damage color dot a if it is bigger
08:16 - than zero then the image is currently
08:19 - visible so if it is visible we countdown
08:21 - the timer so we set the damaged health a
08:24 - timer
08:25 - mine is equals by time time then we test
08:29 - if that timer is under zero then we want
08:34 - to start fading so we go into the
08:36 - damaged color and we start lowering the
08:39 - alpha by a certain fade amount and then
08:46 - we set the damaged bar image dot color
08:50 - to be our damaged color
08:52 - okay so that's pretty much it for the
08:54 - code for our fade effect now we need is
08:57 - to set a timer and show the bar when we
08:59 - do get hit so let's go down here into
09:01 - our on damaged function so this is
09:04 - triggered by an event on the Health
09:06 - System so whenever the Health System
09:08 - takes damage we get this and when we do
09:10 - before we set the helm let's check if
09:13 - the image is not visible so if the
09:16 - damaged color alpha if it is under zero
09:22 - then the damage bar image is invisible
09:26 - so if it is invisible then let's set the
09:30 - current size before we damage the bar so
09:33 - we set the damage bar image dot fill
09:35 - amounts to be the same as the bar is
09:38 - currently showing so the bar image
09:42 - so the image of our image won't keep the
09:45 - same size that had happened before he
09:47 - took damage then we also said the damage
09:50 - Colorado alpha to one set the image
09:53 - color to the damage color and we set the
09:59 - timer to our timer max okay so that's
10:04 - pretty much it for activating the effect
10:05 - when the bar is invisible so essentially
10:08 - that means it's been a long time since
10:10 - he took the last damage amount so
10:11 - everything is reset back to normal then
10:14 - we take some damage and we run all this
10:15 - we set the damage of our image to the
10:17 - same as the previous bar image fill
10:19 - amount we set the color alpha to 1 we
10:22 - set our image convert to that color and
10:24 - we set the fate timer to the maximum
10:27 - however let's say he gets hit twice in a
10:30 - row instead of resetting the effect and
10:32 - resetting the damage of our image fill
10:34 - amount we just want to reset the timer
10:36 - and the Alpha so in here we do anything
10:39 - else so damage bar is already visible so
10:47 - if it is already visible then we don't
10:49 - want to reset the size so we simply do
10:51 - this we set the Alpha to 1 in case it's
10:54 - in between the fade and we reset the
10:56 - timer back to the maximum so if we get
10:58 - hit twice really quickly then it will
11:00 - show the whole thing as just one bar
11:02 - okay so that should do it now in here as
11:05 - you can see we have some duplicated code
11:07 - this way it should be easy to follow
11:09 - what is happening when the damage bar is
11:11 - invisible versus when it is visible but
11:13 - we can also simply shorten this by
11:15 - putting this outside to make sure that
11:17 - we always reset the Alpha and the timer
11:19 - regardless of what happened and when the
11:22 - bar is visible all we do is update the
11:24 - size okay so here it is the exact same
11:26 - logic just more compact so that you do
11:28 - it well let's test and see okay here's
11:31 - the bar now if I click on the image if
11:33 - there you go there's the white part and
11:35 - it fades after one so it showed that
11:36 - this is the amount of damage that we
11:38 - took now if we hit it again yep there
11:40 - you go that's the amount of damage that
11:42 - I took now hit twice very quickly so hit
11:44 - once twice and you know the whole thing
11:46 - resets the timer and then the whole
11:48 - thing fades and the heal some works
11:50 - exactly as in time heal the image
11:53 - and yep there you go okay great so this
11:55 - is our first effect fully working one
11:58 - example of this effect in action is in
12:00 - apex legends you can see it in the game
12:02 - the bar slowly vanishing and I also
12:05 - recreated it in unity so check out the
12:07 - link in the description for the full
12:08 - video of recreating the apex legends
12:10 - health system okay so with the first
12:12 - effect only working let's remake these
12:14 - testing buttons just to make it look a
12:16 - bit better so here in the editor I'm
12:18 - going to create some buttons here on the
12:20 - side okay so here are these two buttons
12:38 - just to look a bit better than those
12:40 - testing buttons so let's go to the code
12:43 - and then here and let's go up here
12:45 - here's where we were creating our
12:47 - testing buttons so instead of this lets
12:49 - you first get the reference for our
12:52 - buttons okay so that's pretty much it so
13:00 - the buttons have the button UI component
13:02 - which is part of the code mock you
13:03 - tommy's it's just a simple class that
13:05 - Hamill's buttons and we trigger the
13:08 - click function to be this damage and
13:10 - heal so now we can get rid of these
13:12 - testing buttons and let's see again and
13:15 - yep here's our bar and here's our two
13:17 - buttons so I can click to damage any of
13:19 - there you go take damage and it works
13:21 - after wild fades and heal and everything
13:23 - works okay great this is just so it
13:25 - looks better to do our testing so now
13:27 - let's get to work on making the
13:29 - shrinking effect so for that let's go
13:31 - into the editor and let's duplicate the
13:33 - bar so that was the bar fade and this
13:36 - will be the bar shrink the composition
13:41 - will be essentially the same we're still
13:42 - going to have a damaged bar except
13:45 - instead of fading away it won't simply
13:46 - shrink to the size of the health bar
13:49 - okay so now let's also duplicate the
13:52 - script so we have a nice starting point
13:54 - so this will be the health bar shrink
13:56 - now let's go to the code in here let's
14:00 - fix all these errors and get rid of all
14:02 - the fade codes so this will be the
14:04 - our shrink get rid of the fade code on
14:06 - our update and also here on damaged so
14:12 - here is pretty much our normal health
14:14 - bar it simply has the health system and
14:16 - it shows all this stuff okay so now for
14:19 - the logic on the shrink we're also going
14:21 - to have the damage bar image so we can
14:22 - leave that and now we need to have a
14:25 - timer in order to know when we should
14:27 - start the shrink so let's go up here
14:28 - make a proud float this will be the
14:32 - damaged home shrink timer and if we have
14:37 - a timer we also need a maximum so up
14:39 - here a constant for the damaged help
14:44 - shrink timer max and that's pretty much
14:50 - it for all the elements that we need so
14:53 - now let's go into our update in order to
14:55 - make our effect and the first thing
14:57 - we're going to do is count down the
14:59 - timer then we test if the timer is under
15:04 - zero if so then we change the damage bar
15:08 - fill amount towards the action bar fill
15:10 - not so if the bar image dot fill amount
15:15 - if the current partial amount is less
15:18 - than the damage bar image that amount
15:21 - that that means the curve bar is smaller
15:24 - than the damage bar so if so and the
15:27 - timer is down then we simply shrink our
15:29 - damage bar fill now to reduce it by a
15:32 - certain amount
15:37 - and that's pretty much it for this
15:39 - effect so we count down the time work
15:42 - when the timer is under zero then we
15:43 - check if the current bar is smaller than
15:46 - the damage bar and if so then we shrink
15:48 - it now we need to set the timer so let's
15:51 - go here into the undamaged event and
15:54 - really all we need to do is go into the
15:56 - timer and we set the timer to the timer
15:58 - max so all that remains is to set the
16:01 - damaged bar image film on and we're only
16:04 - going to change that when we do get it
16:05 - heal
16:06 - so in here when we heal we set the help
16:09 - and we set this fill amount didn't burn
16:11 - image that film I'm not so whenever we
16:14 - heal the damage bar heals along with it
16:16 - and whenever we damage first we set the
16:18 - health which will only change the bar
16:20 - image then we set the shrink timer which
16:22 - after a while will start to shrink the
16:23 - damaged bar image and on start we also
16:27 - need to do this in order to make sure
16:28 - that the damaged bar image starts off
16:30 - exactly like the health bar image ok so
16:33 - that should do it
16:34 - alright let's try out and test in order
16:37 - to test we need to go here and make sure
16:39 - that we set the hump bar shrink and add
16:41 - it in here so we still have our faith
16:44 - health bar let's leave it at that and
16:45 - the shrink with the shrink code let's
16:47 - see okay here we are this is the fade
16:49 - bar and this is a shrink bar and if I
16:51 - click on the image there's the bar and
16:53 - you pastor well it doesn't need drink so
16:56 - hit there is damage and yep it did
16:58 - shrink now hit twice once twice and
17:01 - there you go choose this amount and then
17:03 - it shrinks towards that and if we heal
17:05 - and damage again yep there you go it
17:07 - says that's the amount of damage we took
17:09 - in that amount and that amount so we
17:12 - have correctly built our second method
17:13 - of displaying damage this effect is used
17:16 - for example in second row shadows I
17:18 - twice I also did a video covering the
17:21 - recreation of the health and posture
17:22 - system so if you're interested check out
17:24 - the link in the description so we have
17:26 - our two bars that we can play around so
17:28 - this one as you can see it fades after a
17:30 - while and this one shrinks after I want
17:32 - now we want to work on the final effect
17:35 - and the final effect is having the hump
17:37 - bar essentially be cut whenever the
17:39 - player takes damage so we take the image
17:42 - it cuts this part and then after a while
17:43 - this part should fall down instead of
17:45 - shrink so let's get to it we're going to
17:49 - start off in the same way so we simply
17:51 - come
17:51 - in the editor and we duplicate and this
17:54 - will be the health bar cut now this time
17:58 - in here for the components for our
18:00 - health bar the damage bar image won't be
18:03 - used as a template that we will later
18:05 - duplicate so let's call this damaged bar
18:08 - template here on the anchor and let's
18:11 - anchor it come only to the in left sign
18:13 - so when we get hit we're going to
18:16 - duplicate this template then we're going
18:18 - to place this bar exactly on the spot
18:20 - after the bar was hit then we're going
18:23 - to give it the fill amount that contains
18:25 - the amount that it took and after a
18:27 - while we're going to move this transform
18:29 - down so that's a goal
18:31 - now let's disable the template by
18:33 - default we're going to enable it through
18:35 - code all right now again for the code
18:38 - let's go here and duplicate this class
18:40 - this will be our health bar cut now
18:43 - let's go in and again get rid of the
18:45 - shrinking code okay so here we are again
18:52 - working as a regular bar here in the
18:55 - editor let's add the health bar cut in
18:57 - here and get where the other one okay so
18:59 - now to make our effect let's first grab
19:02 - a reference to the template so in here
19:05 - we grab a credit transform or the
19:07 - damaged bar template and we grab it in
19:12 - here then with the reference to our
19:16 - template let's go into the undamaged
19:18 - function and down here we're going to
19:21 - duplicate our template so we instantiate
19:24 - the damaged bar template so this will be
19:28 - our transform for the damaged bar we
19:32 - need to make sure that we instantiate as
19:33 - a channel that this transform so we pass
19:36 - in like that okay now with our newly
19:38 - created damaged bar
19:39 - let's first enable the transform since
19:42 - the template is disabled by default so
19:43 - we simply go into the damaged bar set
19:45 - the game object dot set active and set
19:48 - it to true okay now we need to place it
19:50 - in the correct location so for that we
19:53 - know the film amount of the current
19:55 - health bar which is a normalized value
19:56 - so in order to figure out the correct
19:58 - location all we need is the maximum
20:00 - width that way we can multiply the
20:02 - normalized value by that weight and
20:04 - get the correct position so let's check
20:06 - in the editor and over here we can see
20:09 - the tonal size of the bar which is 500
20:11 - so now I can go back into our code and
20:14 - go up here to define a constant so a
20:16 - private constant for the bar width which
20:20 - will be 500 and now we can simply go
20:24 - down here and after we duplicate our
20:26 - damaged bar we set the damaged bar we
20:29 - get the component for erect transform
20:31 - and we set the anchored position and on
20:37 - the X we're going to place it on the bar
20:40 - image dot fill amount which again is a
20:43 - normalized value multiplied by the bar
20:45 - width and for the wine let's use the
20:48 - same way as the anchored position okay
20:53 - so just like that we should be correct
20:55 - on locating our damaged bar at the edge
20:57 - of our current health bar now we need
20:59 - the film mount for our damaged bar and
21:01 - that will really just be the difference
21:04 - between the current film mount and the
21:06 - one before we set our help so let's
21:09 - define here a float for the before
21:11 - damage bar fill UNAM and to be based on
21:15 - the bar image on film mount so here all
21:21 - we need is to set the damage bar
21:22 - getcomponent
21:23 - of type image and we set the fill amount
21:26 - to be the V for damage fill amount minus
21:32 - the current bar image fill now and
21:34 - that's it okay so this should do it
21:37 - let's see and we should be able to see
21:39 - our template being duplicated whenever
21:41 - we take some damage okay here we are and
21:44 - the bar down here is the cut bar so when
21:47 - I damage if there you go there's the
21:49 - white part exactly as intended
21:51 - so now let's pause and make sure
21:54 - everything is indeed exactly as intended
21:56 - here is the hump bar cut and here is our
21:58 - template clone and yep as you can see it
22:01 - is perfectly located at the edge of our
22:03 - current health bar and the film mount is
22:06 - perfect to match towards the end so we
22:09 - have successfully cut the part of the
22:11 - bar that we want now all that's left is
22:13 - to make this phone down after some time
22:15 - so for that the simplest way is to make
22:18 - the script so this will be our health
22:22 - bar cut fall down inside this will be a
22:25 - very simple script let's define a simple
22:29 - vote for the timer on our private void
22:35 - awake we set default down timer then on
22:40 - our private void update we simply calm
22:42 - down the timer so minus equals timed out
22:44 - the time then if it is under zero then
22:51 - we need is to start moving this fret
22:52 - transform down okay so we simply move
23:02 - the reference from angered position down
23:04 - by a certain fall speed then after a
23:06 - while we wanted to start vanishing so
23:08 - let's define a time where to start
23:10 - fading so a private cloud for the fav
23:13 - timer so first he counts on the phone
23:17 - down timer after one second he starts
23:19 - falling down when he does we start
23:21 - counting now the faith hammer if the
23:26 - fate time Reza laps then we start
23:27 - lowering the Alpha so let's go up here
23:29 - and also define a color
23:38 - so when the fete timer is elapsed we
23:41 - start counting down the alpha then we
23:43 - apply that to the image and finally if
23:51 - the colored alpha is under zero then
23:55 - this is completely invisible so we can
23:57 - now safely destroy this game object okay
24:01 - so that's pretty much it we have a very
24:02 - nice very simple code we count down the
24:05 - phone down timer when it's under 0 we
24:07 - start falling down by modifying the
24:09 - electrons from anchored position then we
24:11 - start counting down the fate timer when
24:13 - that one is under zero then we start
24:15 - fading our color apply the color to the
24:17 - image and when the color is completely
24:19 - invisible
24:20 - then we destroy this game object now we
24:22 - need is to actually use the script so
24:24 - let's go into the healthbar script in
24:27 - here we have our in Senshi ated damage
24:29 - bar we place it we size it then we go
24:32 - into the damage bar the game object and
24:36 - we add the component for our health bar
24:38 - cut found out okay so that's pretty much
24:41 - it
24:41 - let's test ok so here we are with our
24:45 - three health bars and down here is the
24:47 - cut now when I press the image and let's
24:49 - see there's the white part and if there
24:51 - you go after while the white part film
24:53 - down start to vanish and completely
24:55 - disappear so we can pause to make sure
24:57 - that yep we only have our hidden
24:58 - template the other one indeed fell down
25:00 - and disappeared so you can trigger more
25:03 - damage and you've there you go after a
25:05 - while everything starts to fall and
25:06 - looks very nice
25:08 - and we can heal back up and damage again
25:10 - any up there you go everything looks
25:12 - nice if we wanted we could apply some
25:15 - simple extra logic and make them merge
25:17 - before falling down but like this
25:19 - actually looks quite great so again here
25:21 - are our three effects over here we have
25:24 - one that fits into nothing so we trigger
25:26 - damage there's the damage part and after
25:28 - a while it fades into nothing then we
25:31 - have this one which shrinks so we take
25:33 - some damage and after a while it shrinks
25:35 - to match the bar and yep there you go
25:38 - and finally we have the cut which gets
25:41 - cut from the health bar and after a
25:43 - while falls down and vanishes
25:45 - all three are great effects that add
25:47 - polish to your game so just like that we
25:50 - have created three different
25:51 - but for shown damage taken in a hump bar
25:53 - it's up to you to decide which one best
25:55 - fits your game as always you can
25:58 - download the project files in utilities
25:59 - from mt code monkey comm if you liked
26:02 - the video subscribe to the channel for
26:03 - more unity tutorials
26:05 - post any questions you have in the
26:06 - comments and I'll do my best instrument
26:08 - alright see you next time
