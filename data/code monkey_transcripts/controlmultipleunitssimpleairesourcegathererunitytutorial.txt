00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and in this video we're continuing our
00:03 - resource gatherer AI we're going to add
00:05 - support for multiple gatherers let's
00:07 - begin
00:11 - so here's what we have so far here is
00:14 - the gatherer and here are multiple notes
00:17 - if I click on this note in here the
00:20 - other goes to him he minds it three
00:22 - times one two three when the note is
00:25 - depleted he takes it to storage and
00:27 - right now he's waiting for another order
00:30 - now if I tell him to go in mind this
00:33 - note in here he's going to go he's going
00:35 - to mine it one two three that one is a
00:38 - blatant goes to storage and now he
00:40 - automatically searches for another note
00:42 - located near the one that he was told to
00:44 - mine when on the nodes nearby the
00:46 - original order position have been
00:48 - depleted he waits for another order
00:51 - again so yep he finished mining all of
00:53 - these and now he's again waiting for an
00:55 - order and again I can tell him to go
00:56 - somewhere okay great so now let's not
00:58 - support for controlling our gatherer but
01:01 - with multiple gathers we're going to set
01:03 - it up to first select together we want
01:05 - to order and then give him the specific
01:08 - order on the gathering game object let's
01:11 - begin by adding a selected circle so
01:14 - what's going to the gatherer game object
01:16 - here you can see the gatherer is not
01:18 - visible since the animation system only
01:21 - runs when the game is running but you
01:23 - can see by the shadow the character is
01:25 - placed around here okay so we want to
01:28 - add a circle to display when together is
01:31 - selected so let's create an empty game
01:33 - object and let's name this some like the
01:37 - circle going to add a sprite renderer
01:40 - component and drag this circle texture
01:43 - in here
01:44 - yep there you go there's a circle now
01:46 - let's place it to roughly the same thing
01:50 - as his shadow okay alright so we have
01:53 - our selected circumscribe completed so
01:56 - this is the sprite that won't be
01:57 - displayed when together is selected so
02:00 - let's start off with it disabled it
02:02 - won't be enabled when we actually some
02:04 - like together
02:05 - now in order to click on him we need to
02:07 - have a box Collider and a button sprite
02:09 - the same way we did for the resource
02:11 - nodes so let's go up here and to the
02:13 - gatherer and add a box Collider 2d and a
02:16 - button sprite to our character okay
02:20 - great let's shift it to increase to
02:23 - about this
02:24 - just like that the character mesh is
02:26 - only sentient on runtime but I can see
02:29 - the shadow and I know how roughly how
02:31 - tall the character is so about that you
02:33 - did the trick okay so we now have the
02:36 - ability to click on this gather the
02:39 - button sprite is a helper script that
02:41 - helps us click on a box Collider 2d it
02:44 - is part of the code monkey utilities so
02:46 - now that we have together and let's
02:48 - duplicate them and here let's make unit
02:51 - - exactly the same let's just push it to
02:53 - the side okay and let's also duplicate
02:56 - some of our resource nodes so put it in
02:58 - there a couple more notes here and a
03:00 - couple more nodes here okay
03:02 - now let's go into the gallery I script
03:04 - and capture our clicks so here's the
03:07 - gatherer AI script and in here we're
03:09 - going to do very much the same thing we
03:11 - did for the resource node so we're going
03:12 - to have an event that won't fire when
03:14 - the gatherer is clicked and that event
03:17 - won't be triggered on the button sprite
03:19 - click func so let's do pretty much the
03:21 - same thing let's copy this go into our
03:23 - gallery alright and let's use it in here
03:38 - alright so on the awake of our gatherer
03:41 - we are going to the transform grabbing
03:43 - the component for the button sprite and
03:45 - on click func we are going to fire this
03:47 - event which is a static event that won't
03:50 - fire whenever together is clicked and
03:53 - here just make sure that everything is
03:55 - working let's do a CMD bug text pop up
03:58 - on the mouse position just say click the
04:02 - CMD bug class is part of the code Mach
04:04 - utilities which you can grow for free
04:06 - from Unity code monkey comm so let's
04:09 - test it out and see if the size of our
04:11 - colliders are correct okay here are both
04:14 - gathers and if I click yep there you go
04:16 - you can see the pop-up and if I click
04:18 - outside nothing and there click and same
04:21 - thing on this one okay right we can now
04:22 - click on our gathers so now that the
04:25 - clicks are working let's set it up to
04:27 - catch them in the game handler so on the
04:30 - game handler in here just like we did on
04:32 - the resource node we have a function to
04:35 - capture the click so it's also
04:37 - make another function to capture the
04:39 - gatherer on gathered clink let's make
04:42 - this in here okay great and on the
04:45 - objects under we actually have together
04:48 - a I gather a I equal sender as a gather
04:52 - a I so we are now capturing clicks on
04:56 - the game handler and we can actually
04:58 - know who was late let's go to the
05:00 - gathering I and copy the click onto the
05:03 - game handler to make sure the event is
05:04 - working correctly so let's see
05:06 - everything should be working exactly the
05:08 - same but now the events are going
05:09 - through the game Hamlet rather than
05:11 - directly on the click so I can go here I
05:14 - click and yep it's only got the problems
05:16 - okay so events are correctly working
05:18 - great now let's have an array to store
05:20 - all of our gatherers since in here we
05:23 - just have one and now we're going to
05:24 - have an array of gatherers gather AI
05:26 - array okay and in order to control the
05:30 - gatherer we need to know which one has
05:33 - been selected so let's make a private
05:35 - gather AI for our selected together AI
05:39 - so the array contains all of them and
05:41 - this one contains the one currently
05:43 - selected and in here when we click on a
05:45 - resource node we're going to use the
05:47 - selected together a I however if this is
05:52 - known then we're going to do nothing
05:54 - only if it is different from now well
05:56 - you actually do it so if it is something
06:00 - like to gathering AI is no no one is
06:06 - selected in here order the selected
06:10 - gatherer yeah all right so that's our
06:13 - logic for ordering our gatherers now
06:16 - let's set up to be able to set the
06:18 - selected together a I so in here when
06:21 - we're capturing the gatherer clonk
06:23 - events let's first remove this and we
06:25 - want this gather yeah this is the one
06:27 - that was clicked we want him to be the
06:30 - selected together AI so in here let's
06:33 - make the selected equals this one now we
06:36 - need to showcase the selected sprite so
06:39 - let's go into the other AI and make a
06:41 - couple of functions so let's go all the
06:44 - way down here let's make a public void
06:46 - show some like the sprite
06:49 - another one public void hide selected
06:52 - sprite so in here we're going to go into
06:55 - the transform and find the selected
06:57 - circle that is the game object that we
07:00 - set the sprite for the selected circle
07:03 - and in here set the game object that set
07:05 - active to true and on the hide we do the
07:09 - opposite
07:10 - all right so on the game handler when we
07:13 - set this and like together I let stone
07:15 - to show the selected sprite all right
07:18 - let's see if this bride shows up when we
07:19 - click on it alright here are both units
07:22 - and when I click on them yep the sprite
07:24 - is visible now that one is selected and
07:26 - if I click on this one yep this prize is
07:28 - born out this one it's not lighted ok
07:30 - great we can now accurately select and
07:32 - show which one is selected now obviously
07:34 - there's a mistake here we the selected
07:37 - gather is this one but this one is still
07:39 - shown so we need to tell them to hide
07:41 - the selected sprites before showing the
07:43 - correct one so let's go in our code on
07:46 - the game hammer now in here when we show
07:49 - this light sprite before we set the
07:51 - Neely's unlike together a eye let's test
07:54 - if the selected one if it is not known
07:57 - then we're going to tell him to hide his
08:00 - light sprite if it is known that no one
08:02 - is selected so there's nothing we need
08:03 - to do so let's see and now we should
08:06 - correctly only be able to select one
08:08 - gather at a time all right
08:10 - no one is selected so if I click on the
08:12 - nodes nothing happens now I can select
08:15 - this one yep and now if I click on this
08:17 - one yep as you can see that one was
08:19 - hidden and that one was recent liked it
08:21 - so now I can click on this one and this
08:23 - one ok so we are now correctly selecting
08:26 - a specific gatherer and also showcasing
08:29 - the sprite to show which one is
08:31 - currently selected all right so with
08:33 - this gather selected I can click on here
08:35 - and yep I told to go there using mine
08:37 - and keep mining and now one that one is
08:40 - working I can click on this one to
08:41 - select them and now I tell him to go
08:43 - there so now both of them are working
08:45 - completely independent and as you can
08:47 - see the logic of searching for new one
08:50 - is still working I told this one to go
08:51 - here he mined both of them and went back
08:53 - I toned down to go in here he's mining
08:56 - and he's going to stop once all those
08:58 - been depleted so there you have it we
09:01 - added support for controlling our
09:02 - gatherers by selecting them and telling
09:04 - them which node area they should mined
09:06 - from in the next video we're going to
09:08 - add support for multiple resource node
09:10 - types as always you can download the
09:12 - project files and utilities from unity
09:14 - code monkey comm if you have any
09:16 - questions post them in the comments and
09:17 - I'll do my best to answer them subscribe
09:19 - for more videos and I'll see you next
09:21 - time
