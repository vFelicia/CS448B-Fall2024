00:29 - have noticed that i didn't do one of
00:31 - these videos last month the reason for
00:32 - that is because i was super busy working
00:34 - on my turn-based strategy course which
00:36 - is finally out after five months of work
00:38 - if you want to take your game dev skills
00:40 - from beginner to advanced then check out
00:41 - the course and if you need any visuals
00:43 - right now there's a massive sale on the
00:45 - cinti store almost everything at half
00:47 - price they've got packs for pretty much
00:49 - every single theme or genre for medieval
00:51 - you have their gorgeous fantasy kingdom
00:52 - pack for something cyberpunk you have
00:54 - the sapphire pack for military games you
00:57 - have the military pack or alternatively
00:58 - the post-apocalypse fact there's the
01:00 - heist one that i've used in so many
01:02 - videos the street racer pack for some
01:04 - really nice racing games shops bag for
01:06 - any tycoon and much more so if you're a
01:08 - fan of their style just like me and you
01:10 - need some ass for your game then check
01:11 - it out to the link in the description
01:13 - alright so starting off with a nice
01:14 - simple tool with a very humorous name
01:17 - here is yet another prefab painter just
01:19 - like name implies this is a tool for
01:21 - painting or easily instantiating prefabs
01:24 - pretty much every massive terrain tool
01:26 - usually has something like this but if
01:28 - you want a tool that does just this then
01:29 - this one looks great i'm always a fan of
01:31 - tools that do one thing and one thing
01:33 - alone very well and this is exactly that
01:36 - it works with any prefab so you can drop
01:38 - some rocks trees humans buildings and
01:40 - really anything you want
01:41 - you can include physics or not so to
01:43 - make your scenes much more natural
01:46 - you can even have multiple brushes so
01:48 - one click to place individually or place
01:50 - them along a line or a spline
01:52 - so this looks like a great tool that
01:54 - does a single thing extremely well next
01:56 - up a tool for easily setting up custom
01:58 - inspectors
01:59 - this one features a really nice really
02:02 - easy to use drag drop interface you can
02:04 - add all kinds of fields like some text
02:05 - fields add some colors some game object
02:07 - references booleans and so on you can do
02:10 - all of that without writing a single
02:12 - line of code
02:13 - so this one looks really interesting
02:14 - usually for custom inspectors the best
02:16 - one would be something like odin but
02:18 - this one seems even easier to use in
02:20 - just a few seconds or a few minutes you
02:22 - can have a great custom inspector
02:24 - so this kind of thing that can really
02:26 - help you save a ton of time
02:28 - next up if you want to paint any objects
02:30 - look at this tool honestly this one
02:32 - looks perfect for non-artists just like
02:34 - me to be able to easily modify any of
02:36 - the assets that i use there's a ton of
02:38 - brushes you can use you can just click
02:40 - to paint on any object it's a really
02:42 - advanced tool it also features layers
02:44 - opacity blending modes tons of options
02:47 - also supports pixel art it supports
02:49 - physics and legends for them like
02:51 - paintballs it works on all the render
02:53 - pipelines it's super performant so works
02:55 - well on both mobile and vr
02:57 - it even works in both 3d and 2d there's
03:00 - an undo and redo system and tons more
03:03 - so this looks like a really great tool
03:05 - for getting the most out of all your
03:06 - assets
03:07 - next up if you need some rocks but you
03:09 - don't want to use a static asset pack
03:11 - look at this awesome generator
03:13 - every result generated by this is really
03:15 - unique you have tons of parameters to
03:17 - play with
03:18 - using those you can really see just how
03:20 - much variation you can get it even
03:22 - includes 19 pre-made rock materials so
03:25 - you can get them looking perfectly just
03:26 - like a stylized rock
03:28 - and the rocks themselves use triplaner
03:30 - projection meaning that you can use a
03:32 - single material you can have hundreds of
03:34 - rocks and all of them rendered in a
03:35 - single dracon this one is a really
03:37 - impressive asset personally i think the
03:39 - generated rocks look great so if this
03:41 - town matches your game then definitely
03:43 - check it out
03:44 - then we have another simple but super
03:46 - useful tool the pivot cursor tool this
03:49 - one allows you to click to place the
03:50 - cursor anywhere so it can be on the
03:52 - corner of an object it can be in the
03:54 - middle on a side and so on and then you
03:56 - can do all kinds of operations using
03:58 - that point as the pivot you can scale
04:01 - rotate scale only on two axes easily
04:04 - rotate along the edge or scale in just
04:05 - one direction
04:07 - for me one of my most searched videos is
04:09 - a super quick video that i made on how
04:10 - to modify the pivot basically you need
04:12 - the apparent object and then offset the
04:14 - channel to where you want the pivot to
04:15 - be
04:16 - so the built-in way of doing that is
04:18 - pretty tricky whereas with this tool it
04:20 - seems like it makes the process so much
04:21 - simpler
04:22 - up next we have another simple tool the
04:25 - animation preview it does exactly what
04:27 - it says so basically you just grab
04:29 - whatever character you want to test you
04:31 - dump all of your animations into a
04:32 - single animated controller there's no
04:34 - need to create any transitions anything
04:37 - and it automatically creates a bunch of
04:39 - buttons in the inspector to play each
04:40 - individual animation so it's a really
04:43 - simple tool for previewing whatever
04:44 - animation packs you have and try using
04:46 - them with any character you have then
04:48 - for something a bit more complex here we
04:50 - have a physics joint tool unity has
04:53 - physics joints by default but they can
04:55 - be quite a bit tricky to set up
04:57 - these look much easier and much more
04:59 - capable it includes all kinds of
05:01 - constraints and limits so you can see
05:03 - how it even works with mechanical meshes
05:05 - that are not supposed to deform it also
05:07 - includes some ik so you modify just the
05:09 - target and the other bones rotate and
05:12 - move to reach the final position it
05:14 - features stretching and contracting
05:15 - there's some wiggliness you can even
05:17 - collide and handle collisions with other
05:19 - objects so really quite a lot of
05:21 - possible use cases from some very simple
05:23 - joints to very complex
05:25 - if you have trouble with the built-in
05:26 - tools and maybe some like this can be
05:28 - useful
05:29 - then if you're looking for a character
05:31 - controller here's a pretty advanced one
05:33 - making a simple controller is pretty
05:35 - easy but making one that supports every
05:36 - single interaction that your players
05:38 - expect doing that is pretty difficult
05:40 - this one supports every interaction you
05:42 - can think of so it features some basic
05:44 - movement it also slides on slopes you
05:46 - can push around physics objects you can
05:48 - climb up ladders do a double jump crouch
05:51 - going to anti-gravity and much more
05:53 - you can even apply it to a vehicle and
05:55 - just drive around
05:57 - the demo scene looks like it perfectly
05:58 - shows all the various use cases
06:01 - looks like pretty much a perfect
06:02 - character control up next if you've got
06:05 - a card game and you want to add a
06:06 - character and look at this tool it adds
06:08 - ik to the drivers arms and legs making
06:11 - the character perfectly grab the
06:12 - steering wheel and change gears with
06:14 - their hand
06:15 - this one is a simple thing but really
06:17 - adds up on the immersion factor
06:18 - especially in the first person camera
06:20 - you can really see the massive
06:21 - difference it looks so much better like
06:23 - this rather than just having a ghost
06:25 - steering wheel move by itself
06:27 - also has an easy integration with
06:28 - various other popular car controllers or
06:31 - if you don't have any of those this one
06:32 - also includes a car controller and then
06:34 - over here we have an adaptive split
06:36 - screen tool this one like the name
06:39 - implies it slices the screen to showcase
06:41 - multiple players all at once it has a
06:43 - really natural look so it's not just a
06:45 - boring vertical line up and down the
06:47 - middle instead it dynamically splits and
06:49 - merges the screens depending on where
06:51 - the players are
06:52 - it's really awesome to see it in action
06:54 - it almost looks like magic how all the
06:56 - areas split as the players come apart
06:58 - and they merge back as soon as they get
07:00 - closer to one another so if your game
07:03 - has local multiplayer then this looks
07:04 - like an excellent tool
07:06 - alright so those are my top 10 new tools
07:08 - and systems on the unity accessor for
07:10 - july of 22. there's links to on the
07:12 - description and as a bonus you can use
