00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this course you will learn how to
00:03 - create a builder defender game
00:05 - the design is a really interesting mix
00:07 - between a city builder and a tower
00:09 - defense game so if either of those
00:11 - genres are something you're interested
00:12 - in then this course is just for you
00:14 - with the knowledge you will learn from
00:16 - this course you will be able to make
00:17 - city builders
00:18 - rts's tower defense games tycoons
00:20 - village simulators and much much more
00:22 - even if you are not interested in these
00:24 - particular genres the course will still
00:26 - teach you a ton regarding how to
00:27 - structure a game from start to finish
00:28 - how to use cryptomol objects managers
00:30 - animations effects and so on
00:32 - about me i'm a professional indie game
00:34 - developer with several successful games
00:35 - published on steam covering a wide range
00:37 - of genres
00:38 - i've been programming for over 20 years
00:40 - and using unity for almost 10.
00:42 - also a couple of years ago i started a
00:44 - youtube channel making free tutorial
00:45 - videos to share my knowledge to help you
00:47 - learn how to make your own games if
00:49 - you'd like to try out my learning style
00:51 - before purchasing the course you can
00:52 - watch the over 300 videos available for
00:54 - free on the youtube channel
00:56 - they are presented as clear step-by-step
00:58 - tutorials just like this course
01:00 - now a bit more about the game like i
01:02 - mentioned the game is a really
01:03 - interesting mix between a city builder
01:05 - and a tower defense game
01:06 - so the player has the ability to place
01:08 - buildings and those buildings gather
01:10 - resources
01:11 - there's three starting resource types
01:12 - wood stone and gold although everything
01:14 - is set up in such a way that you can
01:16 - easily add more resource types
01:18 - the resource generation is based on
01:19 - proximity so a wood harvester needs to
01:22 - be placed near trees in order to gather
01:23 - wood
01:24 - the buildings take some time to be
01:25 - constructed and it shows the progress
01:27 - with a nice visual element and a really
01:29 - awesome shader
01:30 - then we have some enemies they are
01:32 - simple but don't look great
01:33 - our hq can defend itself by shooting
01:35 - arrows we can place more towers to add
01:38 - more defenses
01:39 - over time more and more enemies won't be
01:40 - spawned until the player can't take it
01:42 - anymore
01:43 - so it's all about placing buildings
01:44 - gathering resources in order to place
01:46 - more buildings and defending your hq for
01:48 - as long as you can
01:49 - then the whole game has tons of effects
01:51 - and lots of awesome features
01:53 - you can see some cool shaders some glow
01:55 - screen shade post processing
01:56 - a tone tip lots of ui elements smooth
01:59 - camera particles and so on
02:00 - so the final game plays really great and
02:02 - it feels really satisfying
02:04 - the song of course starts with a
02:05 - completely empty project starting
02:07 - completely from scratch
02:08 - and step by step we'll get to this point
02:11 - every single thing in this game is made
02:13 - inside of this course so there's no
02:15 - hidden code anywhere everything is made
02:16 - while on screen
02:18 - also everything is built in a very clean
02:19 - and modular way so you can easily take
02:21 - this as a base and expand upon it with
02:23 - more building types enemies maps
02:25 - resources and so on
02:26 - this course is presented as a thorough
02:28 - step-by-step guide where i will show you
02:30 - exactly how to do what i'm doing and why
02:33 - it is that i'm doing it so you can learn
02:34 - to think like a professional game
02:36 - developer
02:37 - this course will cover a bunch of topics
02:39 - including how to create a building
02:41 - system
02:42 - hand on building construction and
02:43 - resource management handle enemy ai with
02:46 - attack logic and a health system
02:48 - along with projectiles build up the
02:50 - world with resources in specific places
02:52 - and polish it all up with tons of
02:54 - effects particles sound and so on
02:56 - also learn the basics of unity tools
02:58 - like shadowgraph post processing scene
03:00 - machine
03:01 - and much much more as for requirements
03:04 - you really just need to know the
03:05 - absolute basics of unity and c-sharp
03:07 - so if you know how unity works what are
03:09 - game objects and components
03:11 - what is monobehaviour and the basic
03:13 - c-sharp syntax like variables and
03:15 - functions then you should be able to
03:17 - follow everything without any issues
03:19 - if you feel confused or unless at any
03:21 - point in the course then make sure you
03:22 - post your questions in the q a section
03:24 - i will be there to help with whatever
03:26 - issues you may have
03:27 - also every single lecture also contains
03:29 - the starting project files as resources
03:32 - so if you missed one lecture or want to
03:33 - get a refresher on a particular lesson
03:36 - then you can go there and download the
03:37 - resources and follow it from there
03:39 - alright so go ahead join me on the
03:41 - course and let's build this awesome game
03:43 - together
