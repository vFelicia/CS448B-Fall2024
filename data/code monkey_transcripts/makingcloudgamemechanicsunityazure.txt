00:00 - foreign
01:05 - foreign
01:11 - foreign
01:49 - thank you
02:31 - [Music]
02:40 - thank you
04:02 - thing okay
04:05 - all right so go ahead post any question
04:07 - chat and I'll try to keep a nice balance
04:10 - between doing some work and answering
04:12 - some questions
04:13 - okay everything seems good so all right
04:19 - any reason you went to it Azure over
04:21 - gcpr AWS and the answer is really just
04:24 - because Unity recently announced their
04:27 - partnership with Microsoft
04:29 - so pretty much when that happened I went
04:31 - to research Azure so yeah that's pretty
04:34 - much the only reason just because Unity
04:36 - officially partnered with them although
04:37 - that partnership doesn't really mean
04:39 - much at least so far they haven't
04:41 - announced anything specifically but yeah
04:43 - pretty much that that's the only reason
04:45 - just because they announced has
04:46 - partnership so I figured if Unity is
04:48 - going to be more close to Azure then
04:50 - this would be a great time to start
04:52 - learning it that's pretty much it
04:55 - what is the best pricing plan for blob
04:57 - storage
04:59 - I don't know what you mean do you mean
05:00 - in comparison with Google cloud and it
05:03 - only asks actually don't know
05:05 - what is difference to that one but I do
05:07 - know that for the use case that I that
05:08 - I'm trying out for the use case that I'm
05:10 - going to Showcase in the in the video
05:12 - and in these demos these cases it's
05:15 - pretty much free basically on the amount
05:17 - of data that we're storing doing lots of
05:20 - interesting Game Dev mechanics
05:21 - cloud-based game mechanics that actually
05:24 - end up pretty much free since all of the
05:26 - pay as you go they're all extremely
05:28 - generous so yeah
05:30 - this is honestly a really interesting
05:32 - use case and hopefully this video will
05:34 - inspire some of you to add some
05:36 - interesting cloud-based mechanics and so
05:38 - on yeah
05:39 - premium hot cold and archive
05:43 - are you asking what those are I mean hot
05:45 - is basically something that you are
05:46 - constantly uh requesting constantly
05:49 - going to the cloud downloading a
05:50 - pointing and so on calling this when you
05:52 - do that unless often an archive is when
05:54 - you do that like once a year or
05:55 - something like that and pretty much
05:57 - unless often you access the data the
05:59 - more the cheaper it is that's pretty
06:01 - much it
06:03 - but the ENT uses Azure for empty Cloud
06:05 - yep I do think well actually a while ago
06:08 - like uh five years ago something like
06:11 - that Unity actually announced a
06:12 - partnership with Google so I think
06:14 - things like multiplay I think those are
06:16 - based on Google Cloud so the other enti
06:19 - gaming services I don't know maybe they
06:21 - are maybe they are Azure base or still
06:23 - on Google Cloud not sure but yeah it's
06:25 - interesting how Unity had a partnership
06:27 - with one provider and then essentially
06:29 - swap for another so anyways all of that
06:31 - is just it's just
06:33 - selections of the underlying company but
06:36 - for a game developer you can use
06:37 - whatever code you want and Azure is
06:38 - actually pretty simple all right so
06:40 - let's do some work so basically on this
06:42 - first one
06:43 - uh on this first demo I've got a little
06:45 - character right here which is actually
06:46 - exactly the same code as all the
06:48 - characters on screen here so I've got a
06:50 - character in the basic world so that's
06:51 - pretty much it and basically what I want
06:53 - to implement in this demo is something
06:55 - kind of like a Steam Workshop so pretty
06:57 - much some place where you can upload
06:59 - some mods some Sprite sheets some code a
07:02 - bunch of things and then in your game
07:03 - people can download them and one
07:05 - essentially a Sim workshop with the add
07:07 - benefit that with the same Workshop you
07:09 - need to be working on seminar for it to
07:10 - work whereas if you build your own using
07:12 - just some basic Cloud Tunes you can
07:14 - essentially deploy it on on Console
07:17 - Switch Mobile whatever so that is pretty
07:19 - much the main benefit all right so let's
07:21 - do this
07:23 - so the main thing that I want is I just
07:25 - want to pretty much go into the cloud
07:26 - and download the file for some kind of
07:28 - NPC and just place the NPC on a position
07:31 - to work so that's the basic thing that I
07:33 - want to do
07:34 - so let's first actually do this over
07:36 - here in the code and then going to
07:37 - handle the connection with that okay
07:41 - I'm waiting for your Zombie Survival
07:42 - game live stream oh did you see that
07:45 - unlisted video yeah that is that is a
07:48 - idea that I very much want to make but
07:51 - yeah requires a bit more a bit more
07:54 - preparation so yeah that one will
07:55 - hopefully be
07:57 - in the future perhaps next week I
07:59 - definitely want to do live streams a bit
08:00 - more regular so yeah live stream be
08:02 - saved as a video Yep this will be and
08:04 - actually for this one usually for the
08:06 - live streams I put them as unlisted
08:08 - videos so if you want to see all of the
08:10 - live streams if you go onto the playlist
08:12 - there's one over here for the live
08:15 - streams there you go
08:17 - so if you want to see all the past live
08:19 - streams they're on right here on display
08:20 - list but for this one I'm actually going
08:22 - to experiment leaving this one as a
08:24 - regular video whereas all of these they
08:26 - are all unlisted so yeah I'm going to
08:28 - leave it as normal and see what what
08:30 - that does basically because previously
08:32 - YouTube would pretty much punish a
08:34 - channel if if it had a bunch of live
08:37 - streams that didn't get many clicks
08:38 - since that's not the kind of content
08:40 - that people usually want to watch so for
08:42 - this one I'm going to experiment leaving
08:43 - it up see what happens with the
08:45 - analytics and so on so yeah that should
08:47 - be an interesting experiment we shall
08:49 - see but yeah so this one will be
08:51 - recorded right from Portugal yep yes I
08:53 - am
08:54 - okay so so let's do this let me just
08:57 - start our first thing let's make uh
09:00 - let's go into over here the workshop
09:02 - let's make a c-sharp script
09:04 - and let's go and with the cloud Workshop
09:08 - and okay so let's see so basically the
09:11 - first thing that I need is what data do
09:13 - I want to store
09:15 - so
09:17 - let's see actually instead of this let
09:19 - me make a crop where are my all right it
09:23 - was just compounding uh so let's make a
09:25 - script for the data that I want uh
09:28 - whatever I want let's say cloud mod
09:30 - something like this it's going to be
09:32 - very generic even though right now it's
09:34 - really just going to be an NPC
09:36 - but okay so over here I just want the
09:37 - glass just to Define what kind of data
09:40 - do I want
09:41 - hey CPU hey thanks for being here yeah
09:44 - White theme yeah sorry but dark mode
09:47 - seriously burns my eye so yeah I can't
09:49 - use dark mode I really have to use
09:52 - always in light mode otherwise I won't
09:54 - die okay so I want to store in Vector 3
09:57 - for this falling position then I want to
10:00 - store some kind of string for the text
10:02 - message and then another string for some
10:05 - kind of uh Sprite sheet URL simulator
10:12 - and then perhaps add some more muddy
10:14 - things but okay something like this it
10:15 - should be good enough as a starting
10:17 - point so this is data that I want and
10:18 - actually all these should be public
10:20 - always make it private by by default
10:22 - yeah
10:23 - okay
10:25 - uh right so let me go into the other one
10:28 - called Workshop close on these
10:31 - okay so let's do a simple input test so
10:34 - get key down
10:36 - so pressing Tiki
10:39 - yeah
10:41 - okay so when that happens let's first of
10:45 - all just instantiate a cloud mod Cloud
10:47 - mod equals a new one and inside spawn
10:51 - position let's decide on some position
10:55 - then for the spreadsheet URL figure it
10:57 - out and text message say hi there
11:00 - not that it's not hit hi all right
11:04 - okay so I've got a cloud demand
11:10 - what skills we need in Triple A
11:11 - companies well that's going to depend on
11:12 - the company I mean some companies use
11:14 - Unity some companies even in real others
11:16 - use a custom engine so yeah it really
11:20 - depends what company what room what
11:22 - thing yeah that varies quite a lot only
11:25 - input system is more pregnant yeah for
11:27 - for super quick prototyping I run like
11:29 - the Simplicity of this one so yeah the
11:32 - new input system is definitely great I
11:33 - definitely encourage you to use it when
11:35 - working on a proper project but for
11:38 - making a quick prototype this one is
11:39 - just so much easier
11:41 - okay so I've got a quad mob now let's
11:44 - handle quite void
11:46 - spawn Fallout mods or just one mod this
11:50 - is a cloud mod Cloud mod and okay
11:55 - they're c-sharp specific collections to
11:57 - use with Azure now really I mean the way
11:59 - you interact at least the way that I'm
12:01 - going to be using it which is using the
12:02 - Azure functions the way you interact
12:04 - with that is really just with a simple
12:06 - web request so I actually got a class
12:09 - that I made in a previous video and I
12:11 - have since updated it so this one pretty
12:14 - much just does a routine on some kind of
12:17 - URL and just return some things
12:19 - and yeah I'm actually I updated this
12:22 - class but I made it originally let's see
12:24 - where's my browser
12:26 - where's my browser there it is
12:28 - um
12:29 - HTTP which one is it yeah right here so
12:33 - if you want to learn how to contact a
12:34 - URL which is pretty much the only thing
12:36 - that you need in order to interact with
12:38 - anything related to the cloud
12:40 - so that's how you do it it's super
12:42 - simple and yeah so basically all of the
12:45 - mechanics that I'm going to be doing
12:46 - whilst they don't look quite a bit
12:47 - complex they're actually pretty simple
12:49 - once you once you've built them so yes
12:53 - all right so okay so what about private
12:56 - spawn Cloud mod so over here I'm going
12:58 - to need the things that I want to spawn
13:00 - so let me make a serialized field
13:02 - private transform for uh just need to
13:06 - spawn some kind of NPC
13:08 - then down here let's instantiate this
13:10 - NPC on the cloud Mod Dot spawn position
13:14 - not the podmod.spawn position and for
13:17 - turning identity let's see transform for
13:20 - the MTC transform
13:22 - uh and okay just like this spawn Cloud
13:25 - mod and best in the cloud mod okay
13:28 - so let's see if I can spawn an NPC but
13:31 - in order to make sure that works
13:33 - well actually I don't remember I haven't
13:35 - used my 2D characters in quite a while
13:37 - but let's go on this project pretty much
13:39 - make a custom Steam Workshop that is
13:42 - pretty much the goal here uh
13:45 - uh right so on this one it's been a long
13:49 - time since I worked with my 2D
13:51 - characters
13:52 - uh Beyond let's say pfnpc com like that
13:56 - let's make it a pre-film
13:58 - and actually I have to remove the
14:00 - character controller I think like this
14:02 - it should still work let's put this
14:06 - somewhere else
14:08 - and let's give it a different
14:10 - body a different Sprite do I have
14:12 - multiples right here I don't think I do
14:15 - um
14:16 - right so actually let me grab
14:19 - a Sprite just for testing so go into
14:21 - Sprites into my characters
14:24 - and let me just put this over here there
14:27 - you go all right so which Sprite do I
14:30 - want to use just for testing how about
14:32 - the blueprint man so let's go with this
14:33 - one
14:34 - and let me just dump it in here
14:37 - so just place it in there okay
14:39 - so I've got my blueprint man then over
14:41 - here let me just duplicate the material
14:45 - why am I not finding the material
14:48 - [Music]
14:51 - why is that
14:54 - Marines 14 3D okay so let me just that's
14:57 - over here let's duplicate it
15:00 - and
15:03 - okay so it's called the Blue Print man
15:06 - drag it up here
15:08 - okay
15:11 - so over here the blueprint man let's use
15:14 - this okay let's just see if this guy
15:15 - spawns
15:17 - what's saying what do you think about
15:19 - visual scripting in unity I think it is
15:20 - awesome I think it is really great that
15:23 - is why one of my courses is on making
15:25 - games internally using visual scripting
15:26 - so yeah I'm a big fan I think it's great
15:28 - I think it's an excellent
15:30 - it can be a learning step if your goal
15:32 - was to become a programmer but if you're
15:33 - going to be a designer then it can just
15:35 - be an excellent thing just by itself so
15:37 - yeah visual scripting really awesome
15:42 - all right so my blueprint man worked
15:44 - perfectly oh okay I did not expect none
15:47 - all right so apparently
15:50 - I can push
15:52 - push the rigid body right because I
15:55 - don't have any controller okay I'll add
15:58 - another controller so or no just yeah I
16:02 - don't care about collisions so let's
16:03 - just make it a trigger just so I can
16:05 - push them around because that's quite a
16:07 - bit tricky okay
16:09 - can you make game like look for that
16:10 - using just Blueprints and Unreal Engine
16:13 - I mean as far as I know blueprints in
16:16 - Unreal Engine are extremely powerful
16:17 - pretty much just as powerful as C plus
16:19 - plus so technically yes although it's
16:21 - always a problem with some kind of
16:23 - visual scripting or blueprints the
16:24 - problem is always performance so yeah I
16:27 - would not attempt to make a game on that
16:29 - scale using entirely just visual
16:32 - scripting I would definitely use
16:34 - something more proper because you can
16:36 - always mix and match you don't have to
16:37 - always go for a full-on visual scripting
16:39 - or fall on c-sharp you can mix them both
16:40 - so yeah okay anyway so and did that work
16:45 - all right I didn't spawn it just make
16:47 - sure that the NPC okay that does work
16:48 - all right that's awesome
16:50 - so now that I've got an NPC let's make a
16:52 - script to run my cloud Workshop so over
16:55 - here let's just reset this
16:58 - let's go what game is he working on not
16:59 - really a game just just uh preparing
17:02 - demos for a future video
17:04 - future video talking about on the kinds
17:06 - of cloud-based game mechanics that you
17:09 - could build which is a pretty
17:10 - interesting topic okay if I press on t
17:12 - and yep and why did it spawn with the
17:15 - own okay I don't know all right so it
17:17 - worked and it didn't work did I selected
17:19 - wrong
17:20 - or did I not override it yeah I didn't
17:23 - override it okay so you use this all
17:25 - right so yep that one did work okay
17:32 - video on Unity twin twin 2.2 water
17:34 - system package well I won't I always use
17:37 - the LTS version so I won't be swapping
17:39 - to Unity
17:41 - 22.2 or 22.3 when that LTS version
17:44 - happens so when that happens I will
17:46 - definitely check out which ones
17:48 - what are the new features on that
17:50 - version because they're always
17:51 - interesting things all right awesome
17:54 - okay so I can press a button and I can
17:56 - spawn a character super simple by the
17:59 - way I can see someone here using a a
18:01 - custom live chat character by the way if
18:04 - you want to know you can actually do
18:05 - that
18:06 - so if you go here's a nice little
18:09 - tutorial so if you want to customize
18:11 - your character you can download the base
18:13 - texture you can draw up on it and then
18:15 - you can make your own character down
18:17 - here be a bit more special so if you
18:19 - want go ahead and use that it's a real
18:21 - interesting mechanic but actually not
18:23 - many people use it I guess it takes a
18:25 - bit of effort to draw on top of it but
18:26 - yeah only to some interesting results
18:28 - okay
18:30 - all right
18:32 - uh okay where was I right so I can press
18:35 - a button and spawn okay let me just move
18:38 - the position a little bit so for the NPC
18:40 - instead of going on zero zero let's say
18:42 - I went over there in the corner so
18:43 - that's on 2 4.4
18:45 - so up here and let's go with a two and a
18:48 - 4.4 F okay great all right so
18:52 - that part is working all right hey Tempo
18:56 - Jones hey thanks for using it that's a
18:57 - really awesome character
18:59 - yeah boy I haven't played Rayman in ages
19:02 - I think the last one that I played was
19:03 - on the game boy yeah I haven't played
19:06 - the part new ones the Rayman Legends and
19:08 - Origins from what I can see they are
19:10 - excellent but yeah definitely need to
19:12 - know a lot of tweeting around yeah
19:14 - figuring out the correct positions for
19:16 - all the things definitely takes a bit of
19:17 - work but I think the results are pretty
19:19 - fun I think it's pretty interesting okay
19:21 - right so I can spawn a button and spawn
19:24 - a cloud mod and honestly this is the
19:26 - basics that I want to do for now now
19:28 - pretty much just what I want to do is be
19:29 - able to grab this not being hard code
19:32 - over here but essentially just being
19:34 - downloaded from the web okay so let's do
19:36 - that now first thing
19:38 - let's figure out how to convert this
19:40 - into Json
19:42 - so let's save this into Json the cloud
19:44 - mod so this one is going to be a string
19:47 - for the Json string
19:49 - and let's do a debug.org on this Json
19:52 - string
19:53 - Okay so
19:56 - all right so let's see if this one works
19:59 - and if so then save a file then upload
20:01 - to the cloud and so on remain in ages
20:03 - character just remind me of him yeah I
20:06 - mean I made them just because I'm not a
20:07 - very good artist so putting them like
20:09 - this with separate body parts makes it
20:12 - easier because I don't have to make any
20:13 - kind of arms or legs but yeah it's a
20:16 - nice uh it's a nice coincidence
20:18 - coincidence or maybe was inspired by it
20:20 - I don't know I made this style such a
20:23 - long time ago but yeah without having to
20:25 - do any arms or legs definitely
20:26 - simplifies the character creation
20:27 - process so yeah
20:29 - that is really great okay was I doing
20:32 - just
20:33 - tools for making good looking UI I mean
20:35 - good looking UI is all about good
20:37 - looking textures so yeah the tone would
20:40 - be whatever artist tools you have so
20:42 - Photoshop then add a lot of animations a
20:45 - lot of flashy things and so on
20:47 - yeah that's pretty much it Jason utility
20:49 - this is from the standard uh Unity
20:52 - Library so in the engine Json utility so
20:54 - this is all include all right so this is
20:56 - the thing okay great
20:58 - now the next thing that I want
21:01 - uh is to be able to download this from
21:03 - the web so let me actually copy this
21:05 - let's make a file that we're going to
21:06 - upload to the cloud
21:07 - so let me go into my desktop okay let's
21:11 - create a new text document
21:14 - uh what I'm going to call it
21:16 - mod yeah just mod.json
21:19 - and yep and let me open this with this
21:23 - and just paste my Json okay now let's go
21:26 - into where do I want to go
21:29 - I want to go into Azure and I want to go
21:31 - into my storage account okay let's go
21:33 - into containers and let's make container
21:36 - called mods and okay by the way if you
21:41 - have no idea what Azure is how to use it
21:43 - then definitely wait a while I'm still
21:45 - editing the video but maybe the other
21:47 - week after that so
21:50 - everything that I'm doing I will explain
21:52 - in that video so
21:54 - if you
21:56 - oh
21:58 - right
21:59 - um
22:00 - so yeah don't worry if you if you cannot
22:03 - follow this this isn't really supposed
22:04 - to be a tutorial
22:07 - all right okay so mod.json I've got my
22:10 - file in the cloud super simple
22:13 - all right so I got that okay
22:16 - and did I use uh
22:20 - right here because I don't get it
22:22 - directly get it through that okay great
22:23 - all right
22:24 - to use Azure 10K villain coming uh
22:27 - actually no really I mean for the use
22:28 - case that I didn't I mean I've been
22:31 - testing out tons of things and so far
22:32 - I've spent zero dollars so yeah for
22:35 - making interesting game mechanics it
22:37 - definitely doesn't cost much I mean if
22:39 - you try to build a service like Netflix
22:41 - where you got terabytes of data yeah it
22:43 - definitely becomes quite a bit like that
22:46 - but if you use for simple game mechanics
22:48 - you can build quite a lot in its own
22:50 - pretty much free okay great right let's
22:52 - focus what am I doing so mod.json okay
22:55 - great so the next thing that I want is
22:57 - to be able to return this through an
22:59 - Azure function
23:01 - so let's go into my Azure functions
23:05 - where it is there it is all right so
23:07 - here I've got a project this one is
23:09 - connected to my Azure and I've got a
23:11 - function
23:12 - so for the function let's rename this
23:14 - called get mod
23:17 - okay let's rename it okay rename this so
23:21 - get mod I'm only going to have a get
23:24 - okay
23:25 - log let's say just some like get mod
23:30 - is azure paid it is free and paid at the
23:33 - same time so it depends on how much how
23:35 - much you do with it yeah uh right so
23:40 - okay for now let's just return testing
23:42 - okay just like this so git mode get
23:45 - testing so that's pretty much it
23:47 - so let's try first of all just a quick
23:50 - test
23:51 - or actually
23:53 - oh yeah this works I was gonna
23:56 - I was going to use that but okay
23:58 - uh right so let's copy these oh crap
24:02 - yeah I shouldn't probably close that
24:04 - so let's go where's my browser it's kind
24:07 - of hard to
24:09 - see things with all the characters down
24:10 - there but if I get my Rosie yeah testing
24:13 - okay so it is working locally
24:16 - Azure preferable using Unity Cloud I
24:18 - mean those are pretty much very uh
24:20 - different things Unity Cloud does have a
24:23 - lot of cloud-based mechanics but not all
24:26 - of them for example the exam that I'm
24:28 - doing here trying to build a custom
24:30 - Workshop the unity Cloud doesn't really
24:32 - have anything equivalent that would
24:34 - allow you to do that so
24:37 - yeah for the things that Unity gaming
24:40 - Services already exists where am I going
24:42 - just close and publish uh for the things
24:46 - that entity gaming Services can already
24:47 - do definitely I would recommend you use
24:49 - that but for the things that don't then
24:53 - yeah using a standard oh that's why this
24:56 - one is open uh using a standard Cloud
24:58 - definitely has yeah a lot more options a
25:00 - lot more possibilities all that
25:06 - all right
25:11 - plan making a video tutorial on this
25:13 - topic yep I'm currently working on it
25:15 - currently editing it
25:17 - so yeah okay so while that is working
25:20 - let's see that of your videos you should
25:23 - stream Unity stuff more often yep I
25:24 - definitely want to that is definitely
25:26 - the plan now that the tech is working
25:29 - because I made a quick Tech test a while
25:32 - ago said because I hadn't live stream in
25:34 - quite a very long time but yeah
25:36 - everything went quite well so yeah okay
25:38 - so over here get key down
25:41 - any advanced course for 2D game art and
25:44 - assets that you suggest please don't say
25:45 - you and me why not use me I mean
25:49 - what I don't know what Unity uh use me
25:53 - what it has wrong
25:55 - uh yeah I'm I'm not an artist so I
25:58 - really can't uh point you to any
26:01 - specific point
26:02 - but yeah there's lots of udemy courses
26:06 - so I don't know why you would
26:08 - why you would intentionally not want to
26:09 - use either me but okay but yeah I mean
26:12 - there's also tons of awesome free videos
26:14 - on YouTube so if you want to learn how
26:16 - to draw I mean the main benefit that
26:18 - courses provide is simply the fact that
26:20 - courses can
26:22 - they provide a guided path but they
26:24 - don't really have any kind of special
26:26 - knowledge
26:27 - so
26:29 - yeah going with courses or free videos
26:31 - either way pretty much works
26:34 - okay response something what's my avatar
26:37 - oh did you upload something different
26:42 - so I'm going to
26:43 - it's a whole
26:45 - manual validation thing
26:48 - so let me see the validation okay where
26:51 - all the page is loading let me just
26:53 - finish this
26:55 - uh so debug.log doing a simple response
26:59 - of this response
27:01 - and on the error
27:03 - always got all the errors so debug
27:06 - download let's say error
27:08 - and say some kind of error okay
27:15 - yeah you updated so I'm validating it
27:18 - right now let's see if anyone else
27:20 - uploaded a custom texture nope
27:23 - apparently not
27:25 - after that or my website is broken but I
27:27 - don't think so
27:29 - just in case you're interested in
27:32 - interested in making your own custom
27:34 - character
27:35 - There's the link
27:38 - okay and let me just update the
27:41 - character customization where CPU yep
27:43 - there you are with the updated character
27:45 - really nice little t-shirt that's nice
27:48 - all right tied dark mode on Ides nope I
27:52 - mean I have tried it and it simply burns
27:54 - my eye so that is why I cannot do them
27:56 - but yeah that is kind of the issue okay
28:00 - so let's go okay that's the file right
28:03 - so let's go up here into my function
28:07 - and
28:08 - that's going to get mod and just get the
28:10 - function URL and read only mode yep I
28:13 - know
28:13 - all right so let's get my function then
28:17 - go into my there you go
28:20 - paste my function and okay so let's see
28:22 - if this one let's see if we have a
28:24 - response from the clouds
28:26 - time is it ready 5 30. okay nice it's
28:29 - getting good so far hope you're enjoying
28:31 - the live stream I'm trying to do my best
28:33 - between doing some nice work and
28:35 - answering questions
28:37 - press the Y and yep we've got the
28:40 - testing response all right awesome that
28:42 - is great
28:43 - that is great
28:46 - because most are from beginners yeah you
28:47 - definitely will find mostly beginners
28:49 - course goodbye
28:52 - all right uh yeah you will mostly find
28:54 - beginner courses just because that's
28:56 - what well honestly that's what courses
28:58 - sell more because there's not a lot of
29:00 - market for more advanced use cases so
29:02 - the more advanced you are the more you
29:04 - have to be kind of an auto dialect
29:06 - that's kind of how things go pretty much
29:08 - most of the things that I that I
29:11 - that I learned nowadays I have to learn
29:14 - the hard way so to speak by going to all
29:17 - the docs and all the things because well
29:18 - when you're trying to learn more
29:20 - advanced stuff there really isn't much
29:21 - hand holding so
29:24 - yeah that's kind of how things are all
29:25 - right great so over here I can return
29:27 - all right awesome and now for another
29:30 - Quick Test
29:32 - actually now that I think about it yeah
29:33 - no reason to you to contact Azure itself
29:37 - if I just want to test then I can just
29:39 - contact my localhost
29:41 - so actually let's do another quick test
29:44 - so let me go and grab the file Json
29:47 - just go out of this one
29:51 - dark mode saves my eyes yep I mean
29:52 - different people have different eyes
29:54 - that's kind of thing some people really
29:56 - enjoy working on an extremely dark room
29:59 - and I do not I cannot do that I got to
30:02 - be in a well-lit room so yeah pretty
30:04 - much just different people have very
30:07 - different eyes can I paste this like
30:09 - this
30:11 - string turn
30:15 - and actually uh
30:19 - right yeah because right yeah I always
30:22 - forget that it has this the paste
30:23 - special paste Json as classes that is
30:26 - really oh crap I don't want to paste it
30:27 - in there so let's base it out here
30:30 - so paste Json as classes all right so
30:33 - I've got a
30:34 - spawn position okay yeah this one is
30:37 - it's a vector three
30:39 - then you got a string another string and
30:41 - the root object what did I call this the
30:43 - class mod where's my other I call this
30:46 - the cloud mod so the cloud mod all right
30:50 - so over here let's uh
30:53 - let's make it Cloud mod Cloud mod and
30:58 - yeah over here I don't have the Json
31:00 - utility this kind of
31:02 - a thing
31:04 - yep nice step on page yeah but I just I
31:06 - just found that out recently like a
31:08 - couple of weeks ago yeah it's super
31:10 - useful you just post some Json in your
31:12 - in your clipboard then go into paste
31:14 - special and automatically paste the
31:15 - thing so if you've got a really complex
31:17 - Json string this is definitely a massive
31:20 - Lifesaver it's super awesome okay so
31:22 - over here instead of using Json utility
31:24 - since I'm not in unity I have to use the
31:26 - Newton soft Json so using Json convert
31:30 - then I always get this these confused
31:32 - the these serializer serialized I want
31:34 - to convert back so that's deserialize
31:37 - deserialize an object and the object is
31:39 - going to be this string
31:44 - did it
31:48 - cannot convert oh never mind uh cloud
31:53 - mod
31:55 - all right awesome okay so I think that
31:59 - should have worked okay so we've got the
32:01 - cloud mode and let's return the cloud
32:03 - okay actually do I need the okay object
32:05 - result I don't think so
32:08 - so let's see now let's make a mod system
32:10 - light one in fact or it won't I haven't
32:12 - seen the mod system like in factorio but
32:15 - oh crap this doesn't
32:17 - yeah wait what am I thinking about I
32:19 - gotta return jit yeah and it was uh yeah
32:21 - I haven't seen the one in factorio but
32:23 - yep absolutely
32:26 - you can't do that so string return Json
32:29 - Json convert.com object pretty much
32:32 - anything that you can do with the
32:34 - standard uh
32:36 - Steam Workshop that's pretty much what
32:38 - I'm trying to emulate on a way that does
32:40 - not require steam that's kind of the
32:41 - going with this demo
32:43 - okay so I've got the return Json let's
32:46 - see if this one is working it should be
32:48 - returning pretty much exactly what that
32:50 - what that string says
32:52 - so here I got my function let's copy the
32:55 - URL then where's my browser over here
32:58 - let's go in there and yep it is
33:00 - returning down okay awesome so now on my
33:04 - game instead of trying to go let's just
33:06 - go into the local host and try to get
33:08 - that one
33:09 - compound do you have experience with
33:11 - nope that is actually another topic that
33:13 - I've been researching because of course
33:14 - Louie is widely used in in uh modding so
33:18 - yep that is another thing that I've been
33:20 - researching I've seen that there exists
33:22 - something called uh moonsharp yep that's
33:25 - it so yeah I've been I'm actually
33:28 - currently researching that so hopefully
33:30 - within the next few weeks I will have a
33:32 - video on how to use Lua for modding and
33:34 - so on because yeah that one that one
33:36 - would obviously fit perfectly with this
33:38 - kind of stuff making a custom Workshop
33:40 - that would be very interesting all right
33:42 - so yep this did work then contact the
33:44 - download
33:45 - set an Azure free plan yep you can
33:48 - actually go into the the crap uh I never
33:53 - know the link but the pricing calculator
33:54 - if you search for that
33:57 - yep you see the this one is in
33:59 - Portuguese English the pricing
34:01 - calculator
34:03 - so you can go over here you can select
34:04 - all kinds of things and see it yep
34:07 - so for example Azure functions
34:10 - and this one as you can see the first
34:11 - 400 gigabytes per second and the first
34:14 - one million executions are free so in
34:16 - terms of making a small indie game this
34:19 - this part is essentially family free and
34:21 - in terms of a storage account this is
34:22 - the other required part making pretty
34:24 - much any kind of thing uh if you put
34:27 - location doesn't really matter pull up
34:29 - storage with standard just like that
34:31 - with local redundancy with a hot access
34:34 - tier and if you store just one gigabyte
34:36 - and you do pretty much a tiny amount of
34:38 - operations if you do all of that and
34:40 - over here 13 cents per month so yeah the
34:43 - functions are free and the storage is
34:45 - going to cost you at most 13 cents per
34:47 - month so yeah using Azure for small
34:50 - indie games this is definitely a
34:52 - fascinating thing that is likely
34:53 - completely free so
34:55 - yeah that is why I'm covering this
34:57 - because it's uh such an awesome thing
34:58 - that I don't think a lot of people know
35:00 - about so yeah
35:02 - Gibson likes unless he's looking for
35:03 - money yeah most games use little for
35:05 - modding it's one of the most popular uh
35:08 - languages so yeah definitely something
35:09 - that I want to research
35:14 - all right so where was I
35:17 - downloading I get the response to Json
35:19 - okay so now I just got to take that I
35:21 - gotta use Json utility from Json convert
35:25 - it into a cloud mod and it's going to be
35:27 - the response and this returns a cloud
35:29 - mod so that's the cloud mod and then I
35:33 - do spawn Cloud mod on this Cloud mod
35:36 - and now it should pretty much do exactly
35:38 - the same thing as it was doing like 20
35:40 - minutes ago except right now it's going
35:42 - to be downloading it from the web so
35:44 - let's see
35:49 - and press the white button and there you
35:51 - go there's my thing all right awesome
35:54 - okay so everything is working pretty
35:56 - nicely there you go the get mod succeed
35:58 - and everything works perfectly
36:00 - okay so the next step is to make it
36:02 - downloaded from the actual cloud storage
36:06 - as opposed to through here
36:08 - uh and actually for that one now I'm
36:10 - thinking I'm probably going to need to
36:12 - refer back to my own tutorial video
36:14 - because
36:15 - I don't remember
36:18 - how this one goes let's see well first
36:20 - of all I've got two
36:21 - uh I've got to install this one so the
36:23 - web job is extension let's install that
36:25 - package
36:27 - okay it's good
36:29 - so how was this one it was the blog path
36:31 - first of all and let's see where did I
36:33 - upload the blog
36:35 - so it's over here where's the container
36:38 - mods and mod.json so mod slash mod.json
36:41 - okay
36:42 - then file access I just want to read
36:45 - and then for the connection string that
36:49 - is the one that I named and what name
36:51 - did I use it Azure web's job storage
36:54 - Azure web jobs storage okay
37:00 - then I just want to read so just for
37:03 - reading let's use a string for the mod
37:05 - Json
37:07 - okay so that's the mod Json and over
37:09 - here for that instead of using the debug
37:11 - which is
37:12 - copy this
37:14 - and instead of that one let's just use
37:16 - the mod Json
37:19 - okay
37:20 - does this work on the
37:23 - right I actually need to
37:25 - make sure that this is using the
37:30 - storage
37:36 - Azure web job storage
37:40 - uh all right yeah I think this should be
37:43 - working
37:45 - it's your web job search okay all right
37:48 - so I think this should be connecting
37:50 - that fix your turn on learn from it and
37:52 - I'm working on my game that's awesome
37:53 - I'm glad the tutorial on some people
37:55 - that's that's a goal so that is awesome
37:58 - I'm glad it helped you okay so let's try
38:00 - this out and see if that one returns
38:02 - even though right now it's going to
38:03 - return pretty much exactly the same
38:05 - thing
38:07 - so okay everything is working correctly
38:09 - now over here oh I actually close that
38:12 - thing so let's copy the get okay let's
38:15 - copy this go up here
38:17 - and yep there you go okay now to make
38:20 - sure this is indeed downloading the file
38:21 - over here let's modify it so over there
38:24 - instead of being on 4.4 let's put them
38:26 - to the left side so let's save this okay
38:28 - I want to save now let's refresh and
38:30 - there you go minus 4.4 all right awesome
38:32 - okay so
38:35 - yeah now if I run this on the game
38:37 - itself it should already be working so
38:39 - without touching any of the code in the
38:40 - game
38:41 - all right so let's see now press the Y
38:43 - instead of spawning here it's going to
38:45 - spawn around here press
38:47 - oh right I changed on the Zed yeah it
38:50 - works all right awesome
38:52 - okay so honestly just like this
38:54 - everything's already working quite quite
38:57 - good okay
39:00 - all right I didn't think about how I'm
39:03 - going to hmm
39:05 - trying to think about the
39:07 - file name uh
39:10 - [Music]
39:12 - okay yeah I think that does work
39:16 - to download the character
39:20 - hmm
39:23 - okay I'm trying to
39:27 - trying to think
39:30 - during GitHub do you think they might
39:31 - merge a new service I mean Azure has a
39:33 - lot of Integrations with GitHub so if
39:35 - you've got a GitHub project there's all
39:37 - kinds of things whenever you're making
39:39 - new Azure uh resource there's lots of
39:42 - things to connect it automatically to do
39:43 - continuous integration and deployment
39:45 - whatever so lots of things
39:48 - uh okay so the issue that I'm thinking
39:50 - is spreadsheet how am I going to handle
39:52 - that
39:53 - am I going to
39:56 - return the base64 yeah I think that
39:58 - would be quite tricky but yeah okay
40:00 - something like this I think it's already
40:02 - good I think maybe I'll do the
40:03 - spreadsheet a bit a bit later because I
40:06 - gotta
40:07 - I gotta think how do I convert it into
40:08 - base64 in order to save the Sprite sheet
40:13 - hmm
40:15 - because I don't think that I can
40:19 - alright let me think for a little bit
40:21 - just
40:24 - okay got your turn-based course create
40:26 - course thanks alright that's awesome I'm
40:28 - glad I hope you're enjoying the course
40:31 - took a lot of work to make but I'm
40:33 - really happy with how it came out so I
40:34 - really hope you'll learn a lot from it
40:36 - hey I'll just sort of chain is that is
40:38 - it bad weather there because apparently
40:40 - there's a hurricane around that area
40:42 - that is moving towards this area so yeah
40:45 - I hope you're safe I hope it's not too
40:47 - bad let's see
40:49 - uh
40:51 - okay what am I doing right I just want
40:53 - to see can I access this file
40:56 - from
40:58 - this
41:01 - because I
41:03 - write because I did not enable the
41:06 - public access
41:09 - yeah I think 4A for a
41:11 - hmm
41:14 - yeah I think for well
41:17 - I don't know um
41:19 - yeah I mean I think it does work
41:20 - perfectly fine trying to think about
41:21 - it's always the the question when making
41:23 - a kind of tutorial do you focus on the
41:26 - absolute Basics or do you make something
41:28 - a lot more robust that's kind of
41:32 - the thing but yeah so essentially
41:35 - yeah I think I'll Focus mainly on Basics
41:37 - so yeah okay so basically like this I
41:40 - just need to upload also something so
41:41 - let me also upload a character
41:46 - right so let's do a poem yeah because I
41:49 - haven't done a poll in a long time and
41:50 - this one does work so
41:53 - which Sprite sheet
41:55 - and let's see which one do I want to use
41:57 - about Captain America
42:00 - then perhaps
42:02 - Spiderman
42:04 - and who else
42:07 - uh
42:10 - let's see
42:12 - there he is Spiderman or the stickman
42:15 - let's see
42:17 - which one of these one or how about the
42:19 - TF2 medic
42:21 - okay let's make a nice pole and see who
42:23 - wins all right go ahead and vote in chat
42:26 - with exclamation vote and the number so
42:28 - vote one two three or four
42:30 - just select the the Sprite sheet to use
42:33 - for this modding thing
42:35 - so for me which one am I gonna vote for
42:37 - I like the tf2matic so let's go with
42:39 - that one
42:41 - so let's see what's up okay so this is
42:44 - work okay great because I hadn't I
42:46 - hadn't used the poll in quite some time
42:48 - so yeah
42:50 - all right so let's see
42:53 - yeah just write vote and then the number
42:55 - so don't include the n
42:57 - just vote in the number so
43:00 - okay let's see so I'm essentially going
43:01 - to post that then I'm going to save the
43:04 - file name URL on the on the thing then I
43:08 - have to download that file name URL and
43:10 - I'm going to do that with web requests
43:12 - yeah
43:13 - so on web requests I've got a function
43:17 - to get a texture that's exactly what I
43:19 - want so I'm going to post a URL then
43:22 - I've got a string error
43:24 - error
43:26 - and then I've got a cropped beyond
43:30 - Behind the votes string no it's not a
43:33 - string it's a
43:35 - yeah a picture 2D
43:37 - yeah crap
43:39 - texture today for texture 2D
43:42 - so this is what I'm going to
43:44 - receive so I get texture to D and then I
43:47 - apply it design so debug the hog just
43:50 - say texture 2D and if not the book.log
43:53 - say an error and error
43:57 - okay
43:59 - all right so apparently the TFT medic
44:01 - wins
44:03 - okay great so let's do that so let me go
44:07 - into my uh where's my browser over here
44:10 - let me upload the TF2 Medics so just go
44:13 - into upload upload a blob
44:16 - and now I need to find
44:19 - can I just drag it yeah I think that's
44:21 - the issue that I cannot write where's
44:22 - the TF2 medic
44:24 - can I drag
44:26 - the file nope I can't
44:28 - ah it's always annoying gotta browse
44:30 - through there
44:32 - okay so let's find it over here Sprites
44:35 - on my characters
44:38 - and find the TF2 medic over here all
44:41 - right great so what's the point okay
44:44 - great
44:45 - all right so I've uploaded the tf2matics
44:47 - branching there's this one yeah it does
44:49 - show that's really awesome uh all right
44:51 - so let's copy this URL and TFT medic is
44:54 - over there okay that's pretty great all
44:56 - right thank you all for voting that was
44:58 - that was fun it's been a while since I
44:59 - did that okay
45:02 - how to validate the email on your
45:03 - website you just go into your spam
45:05 - folder and click whatever link is in
45:07 - there if it isn't there wait a bit
45:09 - that's that's pretty much it there's
45:11 - nothing else to it okay right so I've
45:13 - got a URL and
45:16 - if we're going that does work so
45:21 - okay so let me just think right because
45:24 - I need the whole URL yeah let's hard
45:27 - code it for now and then download a
45:29 - proper thing
45:30 - okay so let's us and see if it does down
45:32 - with the texture and then I have to see
45:34 - how am I going to upload the texture
45:37 - right and I've got the PF and PC so I'm
45:41 - going to spawn that one
45:43 - uh so
45:46 - right I'm going to need to get that one
45:48 - so
45:50 - yeah this is going to be a bit janky I
45:51 - need to
45:53 - need to modify a bunch of things here so
45:56 - spawn Cloud mods so that's a transform
45:58 - for the spawn quad mod transform or just
46:02 - just the
46:03 - clone mod transform okay
46:06 - and then on this one yeah this is the
46:08 - part that is quite a bit changing I
46:09 - should make a proper script but
46:11 - just for testing just make sure that it
46:13 - was work I think it's called body then
46:15 - get component of the mesh renderer on
46:18 - the mesh render I've got a material so
46:20 - material material and then on that
46:23 - material that main texture set to equal
46:25 - this texture 2D and does that work or is
46:28 - it going to have an issue it apparently
46:31 - it does work it's always the question
46:32 - between texture 2D and texture so on
46:35 - yeah the characters Yep they're all
46:37 - right here it's really nice and by the
46:39 - way if you want to customize your
46:40 - character just follow this link and then
46:43 - if you do that let me know because
46:45 - there's a manual validation process but
46:47 - I am you can draw on top and make your
46:49 - character as early as you want it
46:51 - okay
46:53 - Advanced Resource Management 2D course
46:56 - film Defender but need more advanced I
46:59 - don't know that's I mean there is a
47:01 - billion course types that I would love
47:03 - to make I mean making courses only is
47:05 - really interesting making a a I don't
47:08 - know a 20 hour tutorial that's pretty
47:10 - much what a course is
47:12 - that is always really awesome but it
47:14 - takes a massive amount of work so yeah
47:15 - that's always the trade-off I wish I had
47:18 - infinite amount of time but I don't so
47:21 - yeah all right awesome it did work
47:23 - okay so there's my little character that
47:25 - was downloaded from the cloud all right
47:27 - that is really cool
47:29 - okay okay
47:31 - and actually
47:32 - yeah in order to not make it spawn and
47:35 - then despawn so I can do this okay so
47:38 - now on the cloud mods
47:40 - inside I've got the
47:43 - URL so I'm going to spawn this URL so
47:47 - let's go into the yeah I'm still using
47:50 - this one okay sounds good so if I go
47:54 - yeah because if I just if I use the
47:56 - property URL so Cloud mod and instead of
47:59 - that one which is hardcoded let's just
48:00 - save this one here instead of that one
48:03 - if I go into the cloud mod and I have
48:06 - the spreadsheet URL if I didn't like
48:08 - this down it's going to be empty so this
48:10 - one should give an error so let's write
48:12 - out just to see a nice fun error
48:15 - so let's try that out
48:19 - oh and actually there was another thing
48:20 - that I want to test so
48:23 - a little bit all right
48:25 - so press the Y
48:27 - and yep got an error not found okay
48:30 - awesome that's exactly isn't it I did
48:31 - want to receive an error okay now let's
48:34 - go there and let's paste this into the
48:37 - URL so if I go where's my browser my
48:40 - browser over here
48:41 - if I go into my mod file over here I go
48:45 - inside my mod.json and for the URL I
48:48 - include this one all right save it and
48:51 - just like this without touching any of
48:52 - the code if I now update now it should
48:55 - indeed spawn with that one
48:57 - so press the white button and yep there
48:59 - you go all right awesome that worked how
49:02 - much you weren't with your game well on
49:03 - my last game I actually made a video
49:06 - about it so for battle round Tycoon
49:10 - and if there you go you can see how much
49:11 - money the game made so if you're curious
49:13 - as to how much my last game made there
49:16 - you go you can watch that video that was
49:17 - quite a long ago but yeah when was this
49:19 - 2019 yeah that's when I watched my last
49:22 - steam game so it's definitely been a
49:24 - while I definitely want to make another
49:26 - Sim game once again just need to find
49:28 - time
49:32 - of your accent where are you from I'm
49:33 - from Portugal thank you
49:35 - honestly I hate the sound the sound of
49:38 - my own voice so I'm glad you enjoy it
49:40 - that's uh that's nice at least someone
49:43 - enjoys it how do you type so fast while
49:46 - I've been programming for 20 25 years
49:50 - I mean it started when I was 10 and I'm
49:52 - 34 so yeah I've been programming for 24
49:54 - years so yeah when you spend all that
49:56 - time running on a keyboard you do become
49:58 - quite a bit faster okay right everyone
50:00 - hates our sound yeah it's always
50:02 - it's always a thing okay uh right so
50:05 - what am I doing so here honestly
50:07 - everything is already working quite well
50:09 - the only thing is just publish it to the
50:11 - web but yeah everything it's already
50:12 - downloading from the web and let's just
50:15 - okay let's just do a super quick
50:16 - interaction
50:18 - Ally got a full video on an interaction
50:21 - system tutorial
50:23 - working in uh in a few weeks
50:27 - but over here let's try doing that so
50:30 - let's okay let's do a super quick
50:32 - interaction system because I actually
50:33 - got a bunch more games that I would like
50:35 - to try out during this live stream so I
50:39 - definitely got to get this demo done
50:40 - quickly and yeah the other project that
50:43 - I also wanted to try out
50:47 - so yeah okay but before that one
50:51 - finishes loading let's try doing this
50:52 - one okay
50:54 - so what do I want Let's uh create new C
50:57 - sharp script I cloud interactable
51:00 - okay let's open this
51:03 - now over here let's make it super
51:05 - quickly let's see how fast I can make
51:07 - this so an interface and I want a void
51:10 - interact
51:11 - that's all I want
51:13 - yeah that is honestly all I want drone
51:14 - so that is super simple okay so now on
51:18 - the NPC
51:21 - so let's make e Square for that let's
51:24 - make an easy sharp script won't be Cloud
51:26 - NPC
51:29 - okay let's open it this is a iCloud
51:33 - interactable all right
51:35 - and on this one I do want to implement
51:38 - the interface okay and on interact for
51:41 - now let's just do a debug.log
51:43 - and say interact
51:46 - okay great so now on the player class
51:52 - you know let's actually make one so I
51:54 - don't modify the bass player class so
51:57 - let's create new C sharp Square called
51:58 - The Cloud Player
52:00 - okay so let's make this one interact
52:03 - with that
52:04 - and actually this game despite using to
52:06 - the Sprites actually TV game
52:09 - or actually yeah I was already using the
52:12 - cloud Workshop but yeah whatever anyways
52:14 - uh update okay so on update
52:17 - um
52:18 - input hit key down let's go with kinko.e
52:21 - and on E let's go into physics Let's do
52:24 - an overlap sphere otherwise here on this
52:28 - transform dot position
52:29 - with a radius of yeah the units are
52:32 - pretty small so let's say about five
52:34 - units that should be big enough
52:36 - okay so this returns a Collide array
52:39 - so for either array
52:42 - and then let's see we four inch
52:45 - so for each collider collider in the
52:48 - collateral array and for each of these
52:50 - collider dot try get component try get
52:53 - component of type iCloud interactable so
52:57 - cloud interactable
52:59 - so I tried doing this and if this one
53:02 - does have that component so the current
53:04 - interactive one dot interact all right
53:06 - that's it super simple okay
53:08 - all right
53:09 - so now just need to attach the scripts
53:11 - so there's my player character
53:14 - and on the player let's Hitachi Cloud
53:16 - Player and on the NPC Apache cloud and
53:18 - PC
53:20 - you see the right did I not make it
53:22 - derive
53:23 - uh where's the script
53:26 - right yeah I need to make it mono
53:29 - behavior and icon Dragon alright
53:31 - I'm gonna use the Mickey utility package
53:33 - you mean my code monkey tones I mean
53:36 - I've been working on that since pretty
53:37 - much my first steam game so I guess I
53:39 - would be since 2013 so maybe around
53:41 - eight years since I've been building
53:44 - those interesting utility functions
53:46 - which actually I haven't used quite a
53:48 - lot in quite some time but
53:50 - yeah there was quite a lot of
53:52 - interesting stuff oh crap I cannot see
53:54 - the oh there you go I couldn't see it
53:56 - behind my own character
53:58 - all right
54:00 - I'm as quick as you come up with quick
54:02 - solution I mean that is only just just
54:04 - based on experience so once you have 10
54:07 - years of Game Dev experience like I do
54:09 - then Things become much simpler
54:12 - so yeah the only thing that I can say is
54:14 - just keep on it okay so if I pre yeah
54:17 - actually if I press the E key then
54:19 - nothing happens because there's no NPCs
54:20 - but if I press the Y in order to
54:22 - download an NPC from the cloud
54:24 - and then we're down oh it's the texture
54:27 - now pressing e and yep I do got the
54:29 - interact all right awesome so
54:33 - can I spawn the chop bubble
54:38 - hmm okay now I'm oh
54:41 - just saying
54:43 - custom
54:45 - Avatar
54:47 - uh yep let me just refresh the page just
54:51 - wait for that to refresh
54:53 - um
54:56 - what did I want to do oh right it was on
54:58 - the chat bubble which I think I've got
55:01 - on this
55:02 - script
55:04 - yeah I don't think this part is gonna
55:06 - work is it uh probably not but let's
55:08 - just say
55:10 - well I don't know let's give it a try
55:12 - because actually yeah I should have
55:14 - where did I use this all right it's on
55:17 - the other interaction script
55:19 - okay so there's two new custom
55:21 - characters so let me validate them
55:24 - okay now let me tell the thing to update
55:29 - and let's see if they update actually oh
55:31 - there you go there's a custom character
55:34 - all right so there you go it does work
55:35 - you can draw on top of anywhere you want
55:37 - and yep it does show up and there was
55:40 - someone else with a nice character
55:43 - but apparently not here or is that over
55:45 - there in the corner maybe anyway it's
55:47 - really nice I'm really happy that this
55:49 - system works it's something pretty
55:50 - simple yep there you go it's in there
55:52 - really nice uh
55:55 - um okay so what was I sorry I'm a bit
55:58 - lost in all of my tabs it's all kind of
56:01 - like done
56:03 - second favorite after breaking so I
56:05 - thank you that's quite an honor I mean
56:07 - practice is
56:08 - still great you definitely left quite a
56:10 - legacy so yeah
56:16 - all right so on this one I don't think
56:17 - this is gonna work but
56:22 - yeah I really don't think this is gonna
56:24 - work
56:28 - but we shall see
56:33 - uh yeah let's see if that one does work
56:35 - correct sorry
56:37 - 6 p.m I gotta hurry up because I still
56:40 - want to make the other game
56:42 - um
56:44 - [Music]
56:45 - right so is that one going to actually
56:48 - it might work
56:50 - let's see listening to music or podcast
56:53 - well I don't like to listen to music
56:54 - which is the music that you're hearing
56:56 - right now I'm not hearing it because I
56:58 - have to have the Sound Mirror otherwise
56:59 - it would go
57:01 - on the thing but yeah the uh Lo-Fi beats
57:04 - that's pretty basic and super awesome if
57:07 - I press on the E and I've got a known
57:09 - reference exception which one what is it
57:11 - oh it's the text writer okay
57:14 - okay so it's good so with the kind of
57:16 - work yeah I really gotta make the other
57:19 - one and someone was asking how do you
57:20 - make a custom avatar you can follow this
57:23 - nice tutorial to download draw on top of
57:25 - it and so on okay
57:29 - uh yep the music is in the description
57:30 - it's the live stream for the Lo-Fi super
57:34 - awesome super chill so not very
57:35 - intrusive and
57:37 - definitely helps at least it helps me
57:39 - stay focused okay so I just need to add
57:41 - a text writer
57:44 - which is actually a pretty bad name
57:46 - because there's already something called
57:47 - textwriter but anyways
57:49 - uh how old are you on 34.
57:53 - and by the way I don't think I mentioned
57:55 - it during this live stream but if you
57:56 - want to know how the characters work
57:59 - then I cover that in the mesh video see
58:02 - if you want
58:03 - go ahead and watch that and also this
58:06 - it's a transparent into window for the
58:09 - characters down here so if you want to
58:11 - know how that works watch that one
58:14 - and what was the other thing I wanted to
58:16 - check all right the chat bubble which
58:18 - I'm
58:18 - going to be using here is another one so
58:21 - if you want tons of things that I'm
58:23 - using that I've actually covered in
58:24 - previous tutorial videos which is
58:26 - actually a pretty awesome thing I mean
58:28 - you can go you can watch on live stream
58:30 - see what I'm doing then watch the videos
58:32 - and see it in detail all right awesome
58:33 - it worked now obviously it did not work
58:35 - is only as intended because this one
58:37 - is super big okay so how am I going to
58:40 - do this
58:42 - does this return the not this one
58:45 - the create okay so I'm going to have to
58:48 - modify this one to return the transform
58:51 - so we're going to be transform for the
58:52 - chat button transform let's just return
58:54 - this because over here I'm going to need
58:57 - to grab the chat bubble transform
59:02 - I grabbed that one then I need to change
59:04 - the unlock on scale to something Vector
59:07 - 3.1 times something
59:11 - and for the position also need to modify
59:13 - it so over here let's see it
59:16 - so for the chat Bowl I'm going to need
59:18 - to push it up
59:20 - let's say 0.2 is that too small no
59:23 - that's pretty good then a bit to the
59:25 - side just like that okay great so one
59:27 - 1.5 then on the
59:30 - 0.2 so this one
59:34 - new Vector three on one zero is it zero
59:37 - no it's a 1.5 1.5 and then zero
59:42 - okay great so just like this it should
59:45 - be working it should be or it should be
59:48 - spawning it
59:49 - oh the only thing is the yeah it's not
59:52 - looking at the screen that's okay I
59:55 - won't bother too much with that I think
59:57 - it is already
59:58 - working pretty well okay
60:01 - uh
60:03 - right the last thing that I need is just
60:05 - to pass in the actual text that the
60:07 - Cloud should do so it's on the
60:12 - on the cloud Workshop okay I downloaded
60:14 - I spawn the cloud mode
60:16 - I spawn it over here okay spawn the NPC
60:18 - all right then on the NPC and let's get
60:20 - the component of type Cloud NPC and then
60:23 - let's go on a function called set text
60:25 - and I'm going to send the originally set
60:28 - Cloud mod I think that would make sense
60:32 - then I go into this one so probably void
60:35 - set Cloud mode I will receive a cloud
60:38 - mod
60:39 - and then on this one I can do a private
60:42 - Cloud mod to store it and then after
60:45 - storing it when I go into spawn the
60:47 - bubble I say the spawn text text message
60:50 - so this dot Cloud mod equals Cloud mod
60:53 - all right that's pretty awesome
60:57 - so my avatar doesn't disappear into the
60:59 - background
61:01 - not sure
61:03 - um yeah basically whenever people talk
61:06 - they show up up here then don't less
61:07 - often people talk they go into the
61:09 - background then they get deleted so
61:10 - pretty much only shows the
61:12 - recent the recent people to talk okay uh
61:18 - uh I don't even remember what oh right
61:20 - grabbing so right now I should be
61:22 - downloading the NPC info from the cloud
61:25 - and I should be downloading the
61:28 - Sprite sheet as well as e-text so if I
61:31 - press on the Viking it contacts the
61:33 - cloud and it downloads the character
61:34 - spreadsheet and now if I approach and I
61:36 - do a simple interaction and there you go
61:38 - it does say the message from the cloud
61:40 - so now if I
61:43 - let's just actually this isn't the
61:46 - exactly using the cloud because I'm
61:47 - still using the localhost so let's make
61:49 - this properly using the cloud so let's
61:51 - close this over here everything's
61:53 - already working perfectly so I just have
61:55 - to go and publish it to the cloud so
61:56 - let's publish it okay so while that is
61:59 - working
62:01 - over here on the cloud Workshop
62:04 - yeah really the only difference is
62:05 - change the url so instead of going
62:06 - through a local host I go through
62:09 - the cloud URL all right
62:11 - recording will be saved Yep this live
62:13 - stream will indeed be saved so you can
62:15 - watch it in the future okay so that is
62:17 - working now let me just upload some more
62:20 - things to the cloud just to test to make
62:22 - sure that all of this is being
62:23 - downloaded correctly
62:25 - so I'm going to need to upload another
62:27 - blob
62:28 - so
62:31 - so let's go and see
62:36 - okay so let's see which one do I want to
62:38 - download let's say well how about the
62:40 - other two so let's say Captain America
62:43 - well Captain America and
62:45 - we're Spider-Man Spiderman let's upload
62:48 - both of them okay
62:50 - okay they're both in the cloud so now I
62:52 - just need
62:54 - the URL for this which is really just a
62:56 - name
62:57 - so if I go into the where am I going
63:00 - where am I going into the mod.json okay
63:02 - so this is the mod file that contains
63:04 - all the data so you get the message so
63:06 - instead of hi there let's say hello
63:08 - there instead of using the TF2 Sprite
63:10 - sheet let's use the Captain America
63:12 - spreadsheet all right so now let's see
63:14 - without touching any of the code at all
63:16 - let's see if now it downloads
63:19 - let's see if it downloads from the cloud
63:21 - downloads Captain America and says a
63:23 - different message so let's click on play
63:25 - and let's try it out and see
63:27 - once you save your own last live I
63:29 - didn't all of the live streams are
63:31 - unlisted but they're all over here on
63:33 - the live stream playlist so if you want
63:35 - to see all of them including all the
63:37 - first ones that I did you can win this
63:39 - really awesome one with a live chat game
63:40 - which is actually something that I want
63:42 - to test so just a few seconds but yeah
63:44 - you can watch hey how are you doing hey
63:45 - I'm doing nice thank you there you go
63:47 - another custom character that is really
63:49 - awesome
63:50 - uh what was I doing right so I press a
63:52 - button and downloads an NPC from the
63:54 - cloud yep there you go now it's Captain
63:56 - America and our approach I interact with
63:58 - it and now it's a different message all
64:00 - right awesome
64:01 - okay so everything does work so
64:06 - now I could pretty much build upon this
64:08 - make some kind of index for all the mods
64:10 - add some Lewis scripting from things but
64:12 - you have over here I can download I can
64:14 - download a character from the cloud
64:15 - that's pretty much it alright so that's
64:18 - that is really awesome okay so I think
64:20 - that's enough for this demo I want to do
64:23 - the other demo character customization
64:25 - link that's this one
64:28 - just tell me when you do because I have
64:30 - to
64:31 - manually validate it uh right so
64:35 - okay so for this demo basically just in
64:38 - case you just joined I'm pretty much
64:40 - trying to prepare the demos for a future
64:43 - video talking about interesting Cloud
64:45 - mechanics
64:47 - so yeah okay so this first demo trying
64:50 - to do something like Steam Workshop
64:53 - this one is already working very well
64:54 - okay so now the next one that I want
64:56 - would be some kind of asynchronous
64:58 - multiplier hey thank you so much for the
65:00 - Super Chat Prashant result I'm sorry I
65:04 - really cannot I'm no good at uh speaking
65:07 - Indian name so sorry if I butcher that
65:10 - but yeah thank you so much for the Super
65:11 - Chat thank you
65:15 - [Music]
65:17 - right so what do I want uh
65:20 - yeah the other one okay so oh right
65:22 - before that let me just you the other
65:25 - one that is really awesome
65:27 - although I actually forgot to do one
65:29 - thing so let me
65:31 - just quickly do something
65:38 - uh it's on this one all right
65:44 - just a second I'm just
65:46 - doing something on the other monitor
65:49 - trying to get
65:52 - my thing
65:57 - okay let's just see
66:00 - uh where's the code there it is
66:06 - so just go in here copy this okay
66:10 - all right so let's see if
66:13 - just a quick test on the other one does
66:16 - it have that
66:19 - okay I really hope this doesn't
66:22 - burn
66:28 - save better for cloud saving Azure or
66:30 - steam I mean it depends if you want to I
66:32 - mean steam Cloud save is super awesome
66:34 - but obviously it only works on Steam so
66:37 - that's kind of the that's kind of the
66:40 - downside I guess depending on what you
66:42 - want to do with it
66:43 - so yeah what do you use Azure for this
66:46 - specifically simply because Unity
66:47 - recently announced a partnership with
66:50 - Azure so
66:52 - yeah that's the only reason basically
66:54 - when when that happened that's when I
66:56 - started researching Azure and yeah I
66:59 - just use it but from what I can see all
67:00 - the cloud providers they all have pretty
67:02 - much the same thing so yeah you can use
67:05 - whatever you want okay let me just lower
67:07 - the size of the character so that I can
67:08 - actually see the UI for this little game
67:12 - uh and let's see if this actually does
67:14 - work
67:17 - oh boy it's a bit broken but I think it
67:19 - is worth okay it is working okay it is
67:22 - working oh there you go got double super
67:24 - chats I forgot this one also at Super
67:26 - Chat all right thank you okay so we've
67:28 - got a bit of duplication here
67:30 - so this was a mini game that I made like
67:34 - well I didn't actually finish it's only
67:36 - simple but yeah this is a really awesome
67:37 - idea that I really want to make uh some
67:40 - more uh anyways okay so let's make a
67:43 - gather flag in there and a gather flag
67:45 - in there so now basically this is kind
67:47 - of a very interesting live chat game
67:48 - where you just type some commands and
67:51 - your character won't go somewhere so for
67:53 - example I'm going to type in gather one
67:54 - because I want to go up here and gather
67:55 - whatever this is I don't remember I
67:57 - think it's diamonds
67:58 - so I'm going to type in gather one
68:01 - and my character is going to spawn
68:04 - eventually there you go there's my
68:05 - character and it's going to go in
68:07 - together one and yep there you go he's
68:09 - starting to gather some diamonds
68:11 - all right there you go this is the
68:12 - interesting thing so now some of you can
68:15 - go into gather two and so on all right
68:17 - so yeah this was a really fun mini game
68:20 - Prototype that I made like three years
68:23 - ago I think this was in 2019 but yeah
68:24 - really interesting uh then let's make
68:27 - some barracks and over here on let's
68:29 - make some storage there you go
68:31 - oh look at that uh this is a really
68:34 - awesome idea I really need to get back
68:35 - to this especially now that I'm doing
68:37 - that I want to do on live streams a bit
68:39 - more
68:40 - regularly yeah okay so now go ahead and
68:44 - try building this so let's see I'm going
68:46 - to build one
68:50 - oh man that's something
68:53 - all right so there you go starting to
68:54 - build that one and I think at some point
68:56 - there are some zombies spawned but I
68:58 - don't remember
69:00 - yeah I don't remember could have teams
69:02 - in the battle system yep there's lots of
69:04 - interesting things that I can add to
69:06 - this and there you go these storage is
69:08 - already built and that one I think that
69:10 - one is Barracks yeah this is basically a
69:12 - very Bare Bones prototype
69:15 - I just wanted to check and see if this
69:17 - does work and Yep this work so there you
69:19 - go there you go two buildings there are
69:21 - no errors
69:22 - all right so yeah this project is indeed
69:24 - working so let's go back into gather one
69:27 - I like to get so basically the idea is
69:29 - that I would be
69:31 - this would be kind of like a god game
69:33 - where I play God and you play all the
69:36 - various people so I I don't have any
69:39 - control over all the things then
69:41 - eventually some zombies will respond
69:43 - and the zombies will attack and I would
69:45 - pretty much use a flag to position say
69:48 - actually there's the defense flag right
69:49 - here so I place the fine fire flag right
69:52 - here then you have to type in the fan
69:54 - and people have to go there then I have
69:55 - to ask people to go gather and so on so
69:58 - yeah it's a really neat idea that yeah
70:01 - then
70:02 - that I made quite a long time ago and
70:04 - yeah I think now that I'm doing uh
70:08 - that I'm hopefully going to do live
70:09 - streams a bit more regularly I think
70:11 - this would be a really awesome idea to
70:13 - get back to because because I do think
70:16 - this idea has quite a lot of potential
70:18 - could be very interesting
70:20 - so yeah right now this is the only thing
70:22 - about the
70:24 - about the game just play some buildings
70:25 - and a bunch of points to do a bunch of
70:27 - things but yeah all right so yeah that's
70:30 - pretty much I just want to test out this
70:32 - project that I had here
70:34 - and yeah apparently everything still
70:36 - works
70:37 - this could be huge with twitch streamers
70:39 - yeah maybe that
70:41 - that could definitely could definitely
70:43 - work so if you don't give the bumper one
70:46 - that's awesome
70:47 - all right so yeah I just wanted to test
70:49 - this out and yep it does work so who
70:51 - knows in a future live stream I might
70:54 - take this project and push it a bit
70:55 - further because I do think it's an
70:57 - interesting idea as always the problem
70:59 - is always finding time but I definitely
71:01 - need to find the time to do this because
71:04 - I do think this idea has potential all
71:07 - right anyways
71:09 - foreign
71:13 - So yeah thank you for letting me test
71:15 - this this was fun
71:17 - okay so right now
71:19 - let me go back and make the second
71:23 - game mechanic idea
71:27 - all right so yeah so this one worked out
71:29 - okay so that's awesome I need to get
71:31 - back to this project at some point
71:33 - that is definitely going to be very
71:34 - interesting if I was from spinning too
71:36 - much yeah the spinning animation was
71:38 - just the the most basic animation that I
71:41 - could use to signify that it's doing
71:43 - something so yeah it looks a bit silly
71:46 - the spinning instead of actually trying
71:47 - to gather things but yeah that was fun
71:49 - goodbye all right goodbye when will you
71:52 - be streaming once already 6 20 over here
71:55 - so yeah maybe until about seven so we'll
71:58 - 40 minutes more okay so this one is
72:00 - working so I can download I can drag
72:02 - okay awesome the weird spinning around
72:05 - yep definitely
72:07 - weird but a bit Charming I guess it's
72:09 - too strange
72:11 - okay so the workshop
72:14 - this one did work it worked perfectly
72:16 - all right so that was great now the
72:18 - other one that I want to do was this one
72:19 - a super simple tic-tac-toe game and
72:23 - pretty much just make it
72:24 - based on
72:26 - making asynchronous you know that's
72:28 - pretty much it please save stream Yep
72:30 - this stream will indeed be saved yep it
72:33 - remains to I'm working on my stupid game
72:35 - well
72:36 - don't call me your game stupid I mean if
72:39 - you're working on it then must be
72:40 - something that interests you so yeah
72:42 - just go ahead and yeah good luck with
72:45 - that development all right your work has
72:47 - its own identity good work all right
72:48 - thank you it's very kind thank you okay
72:51 - so up here let's make
72:53 - a simple tic-tac-toe quicksil Mega scans
72:56 - works with UNT I don't know I don't
72:58 - think so or I actually won't
73:01 - if you use in Rio then you can use
73:03 - quixon Mega scans for free but if you
73:05 - use it for free then you must use it
73:07 - within real so you cannot use the free
73:09 - version with unity but as far as I know
73:11 - Mega scans does have a paid version and
73:14 - for that one yep you can use that
73:16 - with unity as long as you paid for
73:18 - things for sharing live streams I
73:20 - appreciate it well thank you CPU thank
73:22 - you and thank you to all of you I'm glad
73:25 - that you seem to enjoy it as long as
73:27 - people enjoy it then I can find the time
73:28 - I definitely want to make these quite a
73:30 - bit more regularly okay right
73:34 - so I want to make a simple tic-tac-toe
73:37 - game
73:38 - and yep okay
73:40 - so let's do this this one should
73:42 - hopefully be simple but very interesting
73:46 - so what am I going to call it uh tic tac
73:49 - toe game state
73:52 - although that's a bit wording
73:55 - you know let's go just cloud game State
73:56 - yeah just like this okay
73:59 - so
74:01 - here let's go for the quality of mistake
74:03 - I just want to take base plus so this is
74:05 - the data that I want to save
74:07 - and for this one uh
74:11 - I only got two players so let's go with
74:13 - a public bullion so
74:17 - uh next turn is player a let's say that
74:22 - then I also got to keep the state of the
74:24 - map
74:26 - so how am I going to do this let's say
74:29 - yeah I think a flat array is probably
74:32 - for the best or actually
74:35 - do I go with an array or do I go with
74:39 - with nine Fields hmm
74:42 - good question yeah I think I think an
74:44 - array should do good uh
74:47 - but that's not a bullion rather
74:50 - oh actually this is a good experiment to
74:52 - see if enums do work so a public enum
74:55 - and let's go for
74:58 - yeah just come with player and I got
75:01 - player a and player B
75:02 - so up here I'm going to do an array of
75:05 - players
75:06 - so player no uh
75:09 - player board the ring maybe that's a bit
75:12 - of a strange name but okay
75:15 - um
75:16 - and then just a polykin for the last
75:18 - move time okay all right so that's
75:21 - pretty much the data that I want
75:23 - so
75:26 - okay
75:27 - so let's go where's my thing all right
75:31 - okay so that's for the cloud game state
75:34 - that you see data for the aim State okay
75:37 - so let's make another script called
75:39 - Cloud tic tac toe
75:42 - and let's make a game object to run it
75:46 - and just reset it all right
75:49 - 25 yep 0.5 you can that is another one
75:52 - that I would also like to research that
75:54 - is interesting that one does seem to do
75:56 - all the things that empty gaming
75:58 - Services seems to do with a bit more but
76:01 - yeah that one is the most comparable a
76:03 - while ago people were asking about TNT
76:05 - gaming services and how it Compares with
76:06 - Azure and Azure is much more of a low
76:09 - level thing so it's much more capable
76:11 - but obviously you got to build yourself
76:12 - but yeah playfab that would be the other
76:15 - thing that would be comparable to ENT
76:17 - gaming services so yeah that's another
76:19 - tool set I guess that I would like to
76:22 - research that would be interesting okay
76:25 - uh so up here let's just do a private
76:29 - void update and on update lets you input
76:32 - that get key down
76:33 - and let's go with the tiki okay
76:36 - so when this happens let's create a new
76:39 - what should I call it Cloud tic-tac-toe
76:41 - okay
76:42 - and on this one
76:45 - wait record no I didn't okay thanks
76:48 - again for the super Channel CPU all
76:49 - right uh okay let me just clear this up
76:53 - okay all these belong to the other demo
76:55 - so don't touch them okay the cloud game
76:57 - State all right that's what I did so the
76:59 - cloud game States so let's create this
77:01 - one
77:02 - 40 and less move time on zero the next
77:05 - is player a yes and the player board
77:07 - array lets you a new array
77:11 - of Cloud Player
77:13 - and yeah this is the thing that setting
77:16 - this up manually is going to be
77:19 - quite a mess
77:20 - or not the uh
77:23 - hello team State player keep player
77:26 - array
77:27 - so this is the player board array
77:31 - only do multiplayer tutorials so I won't
77:34 - do them when in the net code for game
77:36 - objects comes out of preview when that
77:39 - happens yep I won't be doing that
77:42 - so hopefully that should happen within
77:44 - the next
77:45 - few
77:47 - I don't know months weeks who knows I
77:49 - mean there's the unite conference in 22
77:52 - so they might announce
77:53 - a bit of interesting things there so
77:55 - that should be interesting okay
77:58 - uh so let's just create a brand oh crap
78:01 - I forgot yeah right well there's player
78:03 - a b or none of course
78:06 - so actually let's start with none none
78:08 - on all of them so
78:10 - okay this is going to be quite a bit
78:12 - tricky
78:13 - I got three rows
78:17 - I mean it's only tricky for the computer
78:20 - because for the human is never going to
78:21 - deal with this but anyways okay would be
78:24 - easier than Photon pun I don't know I
78:26 - mean uh
78:28 - uh photon is already very good uh mirror
78:31 - is already very good so yeah who knows
78:34 - maybe netcode for game objects will be
78:37 - better than those maybe not who knows
78:38 - it's always good to have more
78:41 - competition so either way I'm definitely
78:43 - looking forward to that
78:45 - hey thank you so much for the coffee
78:47 - thank you it's very kind of you thank
78:49 - you
78:50 - all right so the cloud game state
78:53 - and then I'm going to need one for avoid
78:56 - update game State and I'm going to
78:59 - receive a cloud
79:01 - game State football game state
79:06 - okay so I'm trying to think
79:11 - but
79:15 - all right so the question is do I do
79:17 - this first on just single player and
79:19 - then do it async multiplayer or not
79:22 - but for now let's just we log on the
79:25 - Json utility.2 Json
79:27 - so let's convert this one to Json so the
79:30 - cloud game State converted so that's the
79:31 - string so that the Json string and just
79:34 - do a debug download on the Json string
79:37 - ah crap Json string oh boy I'm missing a
79:42 - lot uh so yep let's go with that one
79:47 - Okay so
79:50 - all right so let's see what this one
79:52 - prints
79:53 - I'm pretty sure that the Json utility
79:55 - does work with arrays so hopefully that
79:59 - should be working correct so if I press
80:00 - T key and if there go this works all of
80:03 - them with the two okay awesome great so
80:05 - this is working
80:06 - all right so now let's handle the uh
80:11 - player input to try to see where I can
80:13 - click
80:15 - so on update
80:18 - oh it's actually interesting for the
80:19 - cloud game state
80:22 - okay focus one thing at a time all right
80:26 - um
80:27 - so if input.get Mouse button down
80:30 - so when I click with the unlock Mouse
80:32 - button when I do that I need to get my
80:36 - mouse warmth position
80:37 - and then I need to convert this position
80:40 - into a grid position to know where I am
80:43 - but it's not a great position It's
80:44 - actually an index position
80:46 - okay so Vector three some mouse were on
80:49 - position
80:50 - and on this one I think I just need to
80:52 - figure out what is the size of the Wind
80:57 - so let's see over here I've got a Quant
81:01 - and the quad is on -10
81:05 - uh oh boy my brain isn't working right
81:08 - now
81:12 - I want to Round right because if I round
81:14 - that is correct right
81:16 - yes I think that is correct so if I go
81:22 - I do a vector 2 ins of the grid position
81:27 - and I do
81:29 - a mouse world I do a new on the mouse
81:33 - one position Dot
81:36 - I take the X I divide it by 10f
81:40 - that is going to give me something like
81:43 - that
81:46 - okay I take the Z divided by 10f then
81:49 - let's just see what this returns so the
81:51 - grid position
81:53 - all right so thanks again for sharing
81:54 - hey Super Chat cute this is this broken
82:01 - oh right because I did not convert so
82:03 - math after round two and gotta convert
82:06 - these into ins otherwise it does not
82:08 - work so meth F dial round two innings
82:11 - all right okay so let's see if this one
82:13 - does work
82:15 - right recognition I just want to say
82:18 - thanks for your tutorials started out
82:19 - three years ago with no C sharp in
82:21 - technology now my first game has 15 000
82:22 - wish lists wow that is really awesome
82:24 - wow congrats wow 15 000 that is very
82:28 - difficult as well so that is really
82:30 - awesome
82:31 - I don't know if you can post links in
82:33 - chat but just did you post the name of
82:38 - World internals is that the name
82:42 - no I'm curious fifteen thousand wishlist
82:43 - that is quite a lot with my browser
82:45 - sorry that Accra store ah crap it's on
82:49 - these two Auto uh steampower.com
83:01 - oh it's this one I think I saw it
83:02 - previously
83:04 - all right looks really great
83:07 - yeah nice assets nice nice grid all very
83:11 - nice and hex different things all right
83:14 - that looks pretty great and with 15 000
83:15 - wishlists that is pretty awesome so
83:18 - let's go into steam DB
83:20 - oh God I don't know is it.net not just
83:22 - steam DB Google won't tell me oh it's
83:24 - not info all right
83:26 - so world
83:29 - ah from Turtles
83:33 - case you don't know steam DB has tons
83:36 - and tons of info including a chart of
83:39 - the of the followers so if you want to
83:41 - know if an upcoming game is looking good
83:44 - looking like it's successful or not if
83:47 - you do you can go here and yep you can
83:49 - pretty much yeah it's funny how your
83:51 - game is pretty much right on the money
83:52 - which is usually the rule is wish lists
83:55 - are 10 times the number of followers so
83:57 - yeah 15K wishlist with 1500 followers
83:59 - yep that that matches so yeah congrats I
84:02 - mean 15K wish lists that is quite
84:05 - difficult but yeah
84:07 - so yeah best of luck with Development
84:09 - coming soon all right best of luck yeah
84:12 - with 15K wishlist you definitely
84:14 - hopefully won't have a successful launch
84:16 - so let's hope for the best
84:19 - okay what was I doing uh just trying to
84:23 - convert down all right so let's see
84:25 - let's see if this one does work so if I
84:28 - click here
84:29 - I've got a minus one minus one that is
84:32 - correct
84:33 - okay that is -1 over here okay zero
84:36 - minus one all right all right so it's
84:37 - already working that one is zero zero
84:39 - and that one is all right awesome
84:41 - uh so to offset this I just need to yeah
84:46 - just pause one because the grade has
84:48 - minus one all right awesome so if I go
84:51 - in here I think the word position in a
84:53 - great position
84:54 - uh all right I just go up here just add
84:58 - it by one and just add it by one all
85:01 - right
85:02 - so then if I go into the
85:07 - uh what am I thinking about
85:09 - hmm
85:11 - yeah I've got the update game State I
85:13 - need to do down
85:15 - in a bit uh okay so the grid position so
85:17 - then I've got an end for the grid
85:19 - position index
85:21 - and this one is going to be the grid
85:23 - position.y multiplied by three because I
85:25 - got three per row plus the grid
85:27 - position.x so on X of 0 0 is going to be
85:30 - on zero zero and it's going to be on
85:31 - three times three
85:33 - is that correct no yeah two times three
85:36 - yeah I think that is correct okay so the
85:39 - reposition index so if I do a debug down
85:41 - log just make sure that this isn't
85:42 - important Let's test where are you from
85:44 - I'm from Portugal thanks for asking
85:48 - and thanks again for the Super Chat best
85:49 - of luck with the game
85:51 - all right so let's see this
85:56 - not crap I'm running out of water that's
85:58 - not good
85:59 - okay so this one is position zero
86:02 - position one two three four five six
86:05 - seven and eight all right Awesome
86:07 - everything works okay great so next
86:10 - thing is to actually visualize the state
86:11 - of the board so that's the update game
86:13 - scene here yep
86:15 - so for that let's receive a serialized
86:18 - field private
86:20 - so prefab cross and another prefab for
86:23 - the circle
86:25 - oh this is a transform
86:28 - so I've got the cross and I've got the
86:30 - circle let's make those pre-spams
86:34 - speak Portuguese I'm from Brazil and I
86:35 - really want to thank you for all helping
86:37 - your codes yep well I'm I'm from
86:39 - Portugal so yeah well I'm from Portland
86:41 - I was born here I live here I'm right
86:43 - here so yeah I do speak Portuguese yeah
86:45 - thanks
86:48 - I'm glad your videos have helped you all
86:50 - right
86:52 - um what was I doing sometimes my brain
86:54 - just freezes okay so I want to make the
86:56 - prefab so I've got a Quant here so this
86:58 - is going to be the prefab for the cross
87:00 - then I need another one for the circle
87:04 - and I've got the cross material let's
87:06 - make these Circle material
87:08 - and do I have a circle Sprite here I
87:12 - don't like that one
87:13 - but yeah if I search for Circle
87:16 - uh those are way too hmm
87:21 - yeah I don't want to go with the phone
87:22 - okay I guess I'm going with the upline
87:24 - even though not a fan but okay sure that
87:26 - works so that's the circle let's use
87:29 - this one okay that's the circle it's a
87:31 - bit too big
87:33 - yeah make it a tiny bit smaller just so
87:35 - it makes sense okay let's make these
87:37 - into prefab so these Circle and the
87:39 - cross make both of them into
87:41 - prefabs yeah that is correct
87:45 - okay right
87:48 - yeah I mean there's a ton of people in
87:50 - Brazil so yeah
87:53 - although what time is it now in Brazil
87:56 - it's on the other side so it's about
87:57 - what 10 am there right now yeah anything
88:01 - I mean I've been working with unity
88:03 - since 2012 so later this year is going
88:06 - to make 10 years yeah and recording live
88:08 - Yep this one is indeed recording so yeah
88:11 - it's 233 really
88:13 - Oh I thought it was a bit more of a time
88:16 - difference okay uh okay what was I doing
88:19 - just write the references so the PF
88:21 - Circle the EPF cross and now when I
88:25 - click I'm going to want to spawn them
88:26 - where's my code where's my code there it
88:28 - is
88:29 - so on the update game state I'm going to
88:31 - receive the collodium state then I'm
88:33 - going to go into the color game State go
88:36 - into the player for the right all right
88:38 - and I'm going to cycle through this one
88:41 - so let's check on through an index I
88:43 - equals zero less than the player board
88:45 - array domain all right plus plus
88:47 - okay
88:49 - so now
88:51 - okay let's see we switch on
88:54 - this guy
88:57 - so if this guy returns a what's a Case
89:01 - Case player.player a then going to do
89:03 - something case player B you're going to
89:05 - do something else
89:06 - and K is none not gonna do anything okay
89:09 - so he's player a and let's call
89:11 - instantiate and going to instantiate for
89:14 - the player a and let's say crosses so
89:15 - the PF cross
89:18 - and for the position okay so now I got
89:21 - to convert an index back into a warm
89:23 - position
89:25 - so let's see Vector 3 for the grid World
89:29 - position
89:31 - and make a new vector 3.
89:37 - okay let me let me think about this
89:42 - yeah divide by three that is the Y
89:46 - right
89:47 - yeah so I take the index I divide by
89:49 - three
89:51 - so one on index
89:53 - 1 is going to have zero so I'm going to
89:55 - need to forward this so math f.4
89:58 - I need to afford this one
90:02 - and then the other one is the
90:06 - remainder is that correct I think that
90:09 - is correct
90:11 - okay let's see if my math is working
90:13 - correctly so on that
90:16 - zero and down and eight load for the
90:19 - grid size equals 10f
90:22 - appears that one times for its size
90:25 - times the equal size
90:27 - okay let's see if this logic
90:30 - is working for turning that identity
90:34 - okay let's just see if this logic is
90:37 - running so update the game State and
90:39 - create a new
90:41 - cloud game state so by default let's see
90:45 - the section by default it should be all
90:47 - empty so let's first try it around
90:50 - [Music]
90:52 - aren't you troubled with object pulling
90:53 - or you don't always use a troubled why
90:56 - are you troubled by object pulling I
90:58 - mean it's an excellent engine just
91:01 - when you need it definitely use it yeah
91:03 - but if you don't need it then no need to
91:06 - use it that's pretty much it
91:08 - um
91:10 - playing any good games lately uh not
91:13 - really although I just recently received
91:15 - my steam deck so I'm kind of looking for
91:17 - what interesting game could I receive on
91:19 - could I play on that one because it was
91:21 - it took one years to arrive that was
91:23 - quite an insane thing but yeah finally
91:25 - arrived so that is going to be
91:27 - interesting how do you have good English
91:29 - if you are from Portugal well I've been
91:31 - learning English my
91:33 - the home programming world is on English
91:35 - so I've because of that I've been pretty
91:38 - much speaking and learning English since
91:40 - I was 10 years old so yeah that's pretty
91:42 - much why I mean my brain works more in
91:46 - English than it does in Portuguese so
91:48 - yeah that's kind of a funny thing okay
91:51 - so that test did work now if I put layer
91:54 - a let's see if I see a cross over here
91:56 - on the first one let's see let's see
91:59 - drum roll
92:03 - and nope
92:05 - okay
92:06 - did I
92:09 - did I put it on the Y where is that one
92:13 - it's on zero zero zero okay so I have to
92:15 - do
92:16 - uh and for the quaternion I also have to
92:19 - flip it forward so I gotta rotate 90 on
92:22 - the X
92:24 - so how am I going to
92:27 - uh it would be simpler to rotate the
92:30 - sound but let them be tricky ah crap I
92:34 - hate working with quaternions is it
92:37 - Euler well this work I never know if it
92:39 - does work
92:40 - ways all right
92:42 - another job besides YouTube I mean I
92:45 - have my games I have my courses so yeah
92:47 - YouTube is just one part of what I do
92:50 - but yeah nowadays YouTube is the primary
92:53 - thing
92:54 - so
92:55 - okay so where am I going wrong on here
92:57 - so let's see we debug.log on the eye
93:02 - and then let's do on this one
93:07 - because I put it on the
93:09 - first one right yeah so it should be on
93:13 - the corner there
93:14 - wait
93:15 - oh no I think it is correct yeah it is
93:18 - correct of course it is correct because
93:20 - I forgot about the offset
93:22 - say Vector 3 for the offset because the
93:25 - whole Grid it's offset by -10
93:28 - so that one is indeed correct so the
93:30 - grid one position is this was the offset
93:33 - all right so like this it won't work
93:35 - okay
93:37 - let's use your Chico routines or async
93:39 - functions well personally I'm not a fan
93:41 - of core routines I don't like the
93:43 - pattern that they enforce
93:46 - so I'm not a fan of them but at the same
93:47 - time async is also pretty tricky so I
93:50 - don't tend to use either of them I've
93:52 - done some standard multi-thread code but
93:55 - async now really don't normally use it
93:59 - is there an API or assets that won't
94:03 - APR assets that won't be used to export
94:04 - model from game like Kenny
94:08 - I'm not sure what you mean grab assets
94:09 - from a game I think there are a bunch of
94:12 - programs that can do that although I'm
94:14 - not internally sure because I've never
94:15 - used them but I do know that a bunch of
94:18 - people mod
94:19 - um
94:21 - they do some mods and they grab the
94:22 - official models from the game so it is
94:25 - possible but yeah not an area that I've
94:26 - ever covered you know decompiling games
94:29 - and doing whatever I know it's possible
94:31 - but yeah never never got into that area
94:33 - okay
94:34 - so this is indeed working
94:36 - so I now know how to take a warm
94:38 - position converting to a great position
94:40 - index that is awesome and I know how to
94:42 - update a game stained so I can just take
94:44 - the cloud game state
94:47 - so let's just take this one so probably
94:49 - for the quality game today so I make
94:52 - this and I create it here okay and
94:54 - actually let's start with none okay
94:57 - so I do this then I go into that one and
95:01 - I'm going to go into the player board
95:02 - array on this grid position index
95:06 - and I'm going to set it to in this case
95:08 - I'm playing as player a
95:11 - and I think this should work okay so
95:14 - let's see
95:16 - prep I'm tapping through way too many
95:19 - windows
95:24 - you know how you made this Avatar thing
95:25 - well if you want to learn I made a bunch
95:28 - of tutorials on that topic
95:31 - so the characters they're all mesh based
95:35 - so you can look into this video it won't
95:37 - teach you how to do mesh animations
95:38 - which is how the characters are done and
95:41 - if you want to make a transparent TNT
95:43 - window I also cover that in a really
95:44 - interesting video so you combine both of
95:47 - those along with the YouTube API and yep
95:49 - you end up with these nice funny
95:50 - characters
95:52 - okay so let's see if I click here no
95:55 - nothing happens oh of course nothing
95:57 - happened I didn't update it well
96:00 - it's kind of obvious that if I don't run
96:01 - the code the code won't run it's kind of
96:03 - obvious
96:05 - okay so let's update collodium State
96:07 - quality game save just update like that
96:09 - all right
96:12 - okay right what time is it 6 40. oh it's
96:16 - already quite late I wanna be able to
96:19 - finish this demo
96:20 - so if I click here there you go Gotta
96:23 - cross click click click and there you go
96:25 - all right I win and that's really
96:27 - awesome okay great so that does indeed
96:30 - work and well let's just verify that the
96:33 - other one works as well so let's do
96:35 - instead of this let's do eight one and
96:38 - do player B
96:39 - and yeah just gotta modify this instead
96:41 - of PF cross so that's a PF Circle let's
96:44 - see that one
96:48 - 7.51 concrete video of yours because
96:51 - there are a lot of well that is why I
96:52 - made the the search bar over here on the
96:54 - website so you can search for anything
96:56 - like shaders and there you go tons of
96:59 - videos that I made on shaders you can
97:00 - search for c-sharp and it finds tons of
97:03 - videos related to c-sharp you can search
97:05 - for crafting and something like that so
97:08 - yeah I've got tons of videos but that is
97:10 - why I made this search window so if you
97:13 - search over here for whatever topic
97:14 - you're looking for hopefully some of the
97:16 - videos that I make won't show up
97:18 - Precision generation yep that is a topic
97:20 - that I very much would like to cover but
97:22 - as usual it's always tricky to find the
97:24 - time but yep definitely very much I
97:26 - especially would like to cover
97:29 - what is it called wave function collapse
97:31 - oh ml agents yeah that is another one
97:33 - I'd like to get back to but yeah wave
97:35 - function collapse that is a really
97:37 - awesome thing
97:39 - that I would very much like to do a
97:41 - video on so that should be interesting
97:42 - okay great
97:44 - parameters X or o to render well I just
97:47 - want to make this a very simple demo so
97:50 - don't want to over complicate it that's
97:52 - pretty much it
97:53 - is do you think could make a premium
97:56 - mobile game or turn one of your premium
97:58 - games to mobile uh not really I mean
98:00 - mobile is meant to be all based on based
98:03 - on
98:04 - based on touch so converting one game
98:07 - directly isn't really a simple thing
98:09 - especially my game since my games are
98:11 - all very Mouse focused so converting
98:14 - them into
98:16 - mobile using touch that would be
98:18 - extremely difficult so it is possible
98:21 - just depends on what kind game you're
98:23 - making but yeah it's uh if you didn't
98:25 - make it thinking about mobile from the
98:26 - beginning then yeah it's going to become
98:29 - quite a bit tricky
98:31 - but yeah and have I made any nope not
98:33 - really I mean I just I pref I like
98:35 - playing Steam games so I just make the
98:38 - kind of games I don't like to make I
98:40 - make the games that I like to play
98:41 - that's pretty much it
98:43 - uh right
98:45 - but I have problems with the building
98:47 - system do you have tutorials on this I
98:50 - don't know what you mean by building but
98:52 - I did the
98:54 - the well I made the house building
98:56 - system so if you want something on a
98:58 - grid like that then also made one more
99:01 - freeform and the other thing which might
99:04 - be super useful specifically related to
99:06 - rimworld is the test system now I made
99:08 - these videos super long time ago but
99:10 - they are really I mean they are
99:12 - essentially how I handle the test system
99:14 - in battle round Tycoon where I've got
99:15 - tons of units each of them doing
99:17 - different stats different tasks
99:19 - different things so yeah that would
99:21 - definitely this kind of logic would be
99:23 - super useful in a game kind of like Rim
99:25 - world yeah okay let me just focus a
99:28 - little bit uh as your playfab yep I
99:31 - would like to research that alongside
99:33 - Unity gaming services and see which one
99:34 - but yeah
99:36 - okay let me Focus just just one second
99:40 - um
99:41 - what was I doing everything is working
99:43 - right yeah everything's already working
99:45 - okay so I got the update game state
99:47 - and I know which one is the
99:51 - okay right great so let's make a
99:55 - serialized field for the cloud game
99:58 - state DOT player
100:00 - and uh this player that's a bit of a
100:04 - strange name but okay so this player and
100:07 - this one is going to be player a
100:10 - okay so when I click I can only play if
100:13 - it is my my time to play so I go into
100:16 - the cloud game State cloud game State
100:19 - and I check next turn is player a
100:22 - and
100:24 - player a
100:27 - so if this player actually why did I
100:29 - call it next turn is player actually
100:32 - that makes no sense
100:34 - if I have this
100:35 - so
100:37 - let's call it current
100:39 - turn player
100:41 - that's a player okay that makes a lot
100:43 - more sense
100:44 - uh
100:45 - so none of this so current turn play
100:48 - actually this testing code I don't need
100:50 - this at all but
100:52 - you know let's keep it like this
100:54 - so this one for the current turn player
100:56 - let's say player a so start off with
100:58 - player a
101:00 - then I make an action I trigger my
101:02 - action then I put the third internal
101:04 - player equals player
101:07 - B whatever's the opposite
101:10 - uh train thing but if you had one method
101:13 - for both layers yep I'm just this is
101:15 - only testing code this is not this is
101:17 - not production code I'm just testing to
101:20 - make sure all the logic works and
101:21 - actually let me
101:22 - put this on the
101:24 - thing here uh okay let me think
101:28 - so I click then let's check the cloud
101:30 - game state so if current turns player
101:33 - matches my current player
101:35 - so if it matches this player
101:38 - then I'm going to do my thing and I'm
101:41 - going to
101:42 - swap it out
101:45 - uh yeah let me make a quick function
101:47 - here so probably player to get other
101:50 - player return a player player
101:54 - so if player equals player a then return
101:58 - player.b
102:00 - and if not
102:02 - then return player dot Inc I don't care
102:05 - about the player.net that's not an issue
102:10 - okay right so get the other player
102:13 - wait did I make it okay make it static
102:17 - all right so over here I'm going to go
102:19 - into the static get the other player
102:21 - other from this one
102:25 - okay so now I can get rid this so I got
102:28 - just this scored eight three percent
102:30 - play my own game okay that sounds good I
102:33 - guess hopeful
102:34 - uh all right
102:37 - so I Center off this one is player a
102:39 - it's going to be the next turn is on
102:42 - this player
102:44 - then if it is this one then I'm going to
102:46 - be able to make my move then I'm going
102:48 - to update the game State okay sounds
102:49 - good
102:50 - all right
102:53 - yeah if you only joined recently then
102:54 - all of this Probably sounds
102:56 - confusing because I haven't done the
102:58 - connection to the Cloud yet but yeah so
103:01 - if I if I click anywhere I can click
103:03 - there you go now if I click I should not
103:05 - be able to click and there you go okay
103:07 - great all right
103:09 - and
103:10 - now let's try doing
103:15 - advice okay anyways yeah okay so this is
103:19 - indeed working
103:21 - now let's do the cloud-based part I'm
103:24 - gonna allow players to click on occupied
103:26 - space yep that is yeah that obviously
103:28 - has to be done but for now let's worry
103:31 - about that in a little bit
103:33 - um
103:34 - right so I've got the club game State
103:36 - now I just need to upload it to the
103:37 - cloud so let's go up here into my cloud
103:41 - function
103:42 - uh I've got the yet mod so I don't want
103:45 - let's make another function so let's
103:47 - create
103:48 - over here let's create a new ad a new
103:52 - Azure function
103:54 - uh
103:56 - we'll start with the get I think that's
103:58 - the most obvious one so
104:01 - um
104:01 - excited get mods so get
104:04 - tick game state
104:07 - of a strange name okay with HTTP trigger
104:09 - okay so get take game State this one is
104:13 - only going to be a get all right
104:16 - let's do analog say the exact same thing
104:19 - and on this one let's just return it so
104:22 - for this one let's do the same thing so
104:23 - let's use a blob in order to return that
104:26 - storage but it's not going to be in
104:28 - there so tic tac toe and inside let's
104:31 - say game state DOT Json
104:34 - and yep so this one is the
104:38 - Tic Tac
104:39 - toe
104:42 - tic-tac-toe
104:44 - game State Json
104:47 - and well actually right now let's just
104:49 - return that one directly okay so let's
104:51 - make this one so let's go into Azure
104:52 - where's my Azure so let's go outside the
104:56 - containers let's make another container
104:58 - and for this one let's call it
105:00 - tic-tac-toe okay let's create
105:02 - all right let's go inside it now let's
105:05 - make a file to save it so let's go down
105:09 - here
105:10 - let's call it uh tic tac toe game state
105:15 - DOT Json
105:17 - and just need to copy the Json for this
105:19 - one
105:21 - okay so I update the game State and
105:25 - after updating let's do a debug.log
105:28 - go into the Json utility and copy to
105:32 - Json for this one all right so let's
105:34 - make a move and copy the Json
105:38 - oh boy yeah I'm running out of water
105:40 - it's almost seven so almost about time
105:43 - so you don't be available later or
105:45 - delete it it won't be
105:47 - only now I noticed that the characters
105:50 - stopped working well that's a bit messed
105:53 - up or did it apparently not
105:58 - okay apparently not apparently they were
106:00 - broken for a while now they came back
106:01 - okay anyways I don't know I suppose it's
106:03 - easier to make a web socket
106:06 - yep you could you could make websockets
106:08 - but my specific my specific demo that
106:10 - I'm trying to achieve here is making it
106:12 - asynchronous so like one player plays
106:14 - one move then Waits five hours and the
106:17 - other player plays their move and so on
106:18 - obviously that would not make sense on a
106:20 - simple game like that too but thinking
106:22 - of something like Civilization something
106:24 - like that yeah that would make sense to
106:26 - make some kind of asynchronous
106:27 - multiplayer hey Gabrielle how's it going
106:30 - all right so post and let's see
106:36 - I'm out of water that's not good okay
106:39 - right so let's just copy this
106:43 - and let's face all right so this is my
106:45 - Json yep that one is correct okay so
106:48 - I've got to move okay would work perfect
106:49 - for European universals yep that's
106:51 - exactly the kind of games that
106:53 - asynchronous multiplayer would be
106:55 - perfect for so
106:57 - let me upload let me just find the blob
107:00 - to upload
107:03 - so I gotta go to my desktop the
107:06 - tic-tac-toe game.json
107:08 - okay let's upload that one and let's see
107:11 - and edit
107:13 - and yep there it is all right
107:16 - so
107:18 - now if I
107:20 - access that it should automatically so
107:24 - let's do it on
107:25 - start does make sense on start
107:28 - yeah I think it does make sense sir
107:31 - um okay so on start one let's actually
107:34 - copy the
107:35 - well what did I name the other one yeah
107:38 - actually there's no need to copy the
107:40 - code is super simple so just web
107:41 - requests Let's see we get and forget we
107:44 - need a certain endpoint then going to
107:46 - return a string for the error
107:48 - then another string for the response
107:52 - okay
107:55 - so let's put all this
107:59 - all right
108:00 - okay so for the URL let's actually test
108:04 - it locally first so where's my there you
108:06 - go so this one yeah you just were turned
108:08 - down
108:09 - so yeah this one should already be
108:11 - working should be working locally that
108:13 - should work small to work for card
108:15 - selling gaming like cartoon or PVC
108:17 - Heroes yep it would definitely work I
108:18 - mean it's asynchronous multiplayer so
108:21 - any kind of multiplayer that you want to
108:22 - do
108:23 - without being in real time Yep this
108:25 - would be an excellent way to do it so
108:27 - let's see if that one returns
108:31 - did that not what is that is that an
108:33 - error
108:35 - no
108:38 - why is someone not
108:41 - okay that's strange
108:44 - why am I going to the URL and it's not
108:47 - going okay
108:49 - okay I have no idea
108:51 - that's strange why is it going but
108:54 - doesn't go
109:00 - maybe I didn't return anything
109:04 - no
109:08 - okay that's strange
109:11 - okay yeah I guess that's why
109:13 - uh yeah it kind of helps if you use the
109:17 - same file name that's kind of useful I
109:20 - guess
109:21 - let's open yeah that's why that one
109:23 - wasn't opening because obviously I did
109:25 - not use the same name so
109:27 - that kind of helps so let's do that
109:30 - let's go start off okay so now it should
109:32 - work
109:33 - is it running
109:35 - let's make sure that the file is running
109:37 - okay it is running so let's go up here
109:39 - let's go
109:42 - okay
109:49 - is it
109:54 - okay I'm a bit
109:57 - confused
109:59 - [Music]
110:01 - why is it not
110:04 - all right something is
110:06 - something is strange here
110:11 - you have two times Json do I oh God
110:14 - thank you oh man
110:17 - that's annoying
110:19 - all right so let's see if now it works
110:21 - yeah I'm definitely starting to become
110:24 - tired starting to make dumb mistakes
110:25 - that is definitely wise let's see if now
110:28 - it does work
110:30 - and yep there you go okay great all
110:33 - right so let's use this URL and now
110:35 - hopefully everything should work so here
110:38 - let's pass that URL let's see debug.log
110:41 - say error
110:43 - error
110:44 - and if not let's say the response and if
110:47 - I got the response then I'm going to use
110:49 - Json utility to convert from Json
110:52 - from Json yeah that is correct this is
110:54 - the cloud game state
110:57 - and I'm going to make a file game State
110:59 - cloud game state
111:02 - okay so I've got this one the response
111:05 - converted into that one then using that
111:07 - one I can just go and update the game
111:09 - state
111:10 - all right so now when I spawn the game
111:13 - it should spawn in the state that it was
111:15 - in last time
111:18 - seeing
111:19 - just watch the updates here read me
111:21 - courses I need to know about
111:22 - addressables thanks well that's awesome
111:23 - yeah that was that was really great to
111:26 - research you know the uh addressables
111:28 - are super
111:30 - super interesting thing and I thought it
111:33 - was going to be quite complex but
111:35 - actually it was pretty simple pretty
111:36 - easy to learn so yeah that was an
111:38 - interesting one all right so yeah the
111:41 - code did work so I spawned it and on
111:43 - start contacted the cloud and there you
111:45 - go with that poster thing all right
111:47 - awesome
111:48 - so now I can pretend to be the other
111:50 - player because actually I'm still
111:52 - playing as the cross player
111:54 - so if I now click okay that shouldn't
111:57 - have worked did I oh right of course
112:00 - that worked that worked because I made a
112:02 - local
112:04 - variable of course that is why
112:07 - so if I use the same one then now it
112:09 - should work so now it should download
112:10 - the cross on the side and when I click
112:13 - it should not allow me to click
112:15 - so let's test
112:19 - I have to switch layers yep so now if I
112:21 - click and nope okay great nothing
112:23 - happens now if I go into my code and I
112:26 - swap from player a now I'm player B and
112:29 - I click
112:31 - and it worked and didn't work
112:34 - okay
112:36 - why did you
112:43 - okay so let's see what part of it went
112:47 - wrong was it caching something no I
112:49 - don't think so yeah because that one
112:51 - it's
112:52 - and why did it plays three crosses I
112:54 - don't know
112:55 - um
112:57 - oh right because I'm not deleting okay
112:59 - so I gotta handle deletion as well all
113:00 - right
113:01 - yeah that one that one should be cross
113:04 - I'm I'm pretty sure I know where the
113:07 - issue is yep there you go this is the
113:09 - issue over here I gotta say that I am
113:11 - this player I'm not the other player all
113:13 - right
113:14 - so now it should indeed work
113:18 - okay so let's let's put this yeah just
113:21 - on play focused just so I can easily
113:23 - modify it
113:24 - so if I am player so start off player
113:27 - clicked on that so I cannot make a move
113:29 - but now if I'm playing as the circles
113:31 - and I click and yep does work and now if
113:34 - I click again and okay great does not
113:36 - work if I swap back into player a and
113:38 - click and you have this work back into B
113:41 - click back into a clean all right
113:43 - awesome that does work
113:45 - how are you spinning that pin well those
113:47 - are pen tricks that I've learned like 20
113:50 - years ago they used to be really awesome
113:52 - to be on
113:54 - what was the website pen tricks
113:57 - yeah Pinterest the pen spinning
113:59 - Revolution this was really awesome a
114:01 - bunch of people using some really
114:02 - special pens do a bunch of tricks
114:05 - yeah that was uh
114:07 - oh yeah pen spinning that is the
114:10 - technical term it's youtube.com
114:13 - for
114:15 - ah crap why can't I
114:18 - the thumb around
114:20 - what's the name of the trick
114:22 - let's say oh if I can like this one
114:24 - something happened to the stream let's
114:25 - hope not
114:28 - thanks
114:29 - very interesting so okay just gotta wait
114:33 - for the
114:36 - okay come on come on
114:38 - there you go pendrick so if you want to
114:40 - learn yeah it's a pretty fun thing if
114:41 - you use a proper pen things get quite
114:44 - easier
114:46 - yeah there you go the uh what's it
114:49 - called the jump around something like
114:50 - that
114:51 - yeah that was a an interesting one yeah
114:53 - that's the is that the Sonic I think so
114:55 - that was fun yeah I spent a lot of time
114:58 - as a kid playing around with a bunch of
115:00 - pen tricks that was a
115:01 - it was a fun thing so nowadays I still
115:04 - know only about two or three yeah so
115:06 - it's a fun thing to do while thinking
115:09 - it's nice okay anyways uh what was I
115:12 - doing what was I doing
115:15 - this is indeed working yep so the next
115:18 - thing that I want is to
115:21 - well I have to upload the game State and
115:24 - then I have to request the thing okay so
115:27 - let's first hand on the uploading the
115:29 - game state
115:30 - so oh boy it's already seven all right I
115:33 - gotta can do it to another pen I mean
115:35 - this one is a normal pen it just needs
115:37 - to have the weight bouncing up but yeah
115:39 - this one is a normal Trend so it does
115:40 - work okay so set game state
115:44 - let's make an Azure function with an
115:46 - HTTP trigger okay
115:47 - and let's call it set game State this
115:50 - one is going to have just a post
115:53 - and the issues that I don't remember how
115:55 - I did it so let me refer back to my
115:57 - previous project
115:59 - so that I remember how I handled that
116:03 - and let's return just okay it doesn't
116:06 - really matter so for the get him state
116:09 - let me just uh the leaderboard functions
116:12 - I should be able to
116:14 - write
116:16 - okay so let's see how I did in my
116:18 - previous thing so just use the
116:20 - text right this is the ad score yep
116:24 - uh not to get away for this one okay
116:26 - so on this one let's call it uh what am
116:30 - I gonna call this what did I called all
116:33 - I gotta use the
116:34 - same file same thing
116:37 - so let's use this one
116:39 - so tic-tac-toe game stained
116:42 - uh
116:44 - so game State Moab text writer all right
116:48 - so I've got this one and how do I write
116:49 - onto it
116:51 - I first deserialize the object do I need
116:53 - to yeah I don't need to do that now that
116:55 - I think about it I just need the request
116:57 - body
116:59 - yeah I think that's the only thing that
117:00 - I need
117:02 - yeah so this is actually super simple
117:05 - obviously what I'm doing here isn't
117:07 - secure at all so if you want to use this
117:09 - in a proper game you'd have to
117:12 - upgrade Upon This by quite a while but
117:15 - yeah
117:18 - for this simple demo this does work very
117:21 - well
117:23 - okay so yeah I think that sounds way too
117:26 - simple but I genuinely think this is
117:28 - only take so the set team State on a
117:31 - post and yeah and this one is still open
117:33 - okay so if I go into okay I don't need
117:38 - the leaderboard now if I go
117:42 - uh yeah what am I doing
117:46 - okay so up here update the game State I
117:49 - do my move I do whatever sure then over
117:51 - here web requests and let's do a post
117:55 - with Json
117:56 - and for the URL I'm going to need that
117:59 - URL then for the Json data let's go into
118:02 - Json utility to Json convert the cloud
118:05 - game state
118:06 - okay so I convert that one into Json
118:09 - then I've got a string for the error
118:11 - usual stuff
118:13 - thing
118:15 - and I've got a string for the response
118:18 - even though this one isn't really going
118:20 - to return response but yeah sure just uh
118:23 - no return debug's unlocked on my
118:26 - response
118:29 - okay and over here default.log on my
118:32 - error
118:34 - okay
118:36 - so I'm going to post the cloud game set
118:37 - down is going to save it then it's going
118:39 - to update the game set all right sounds
118:41 - good
118:41 - so all that I need is the URL for that
118:44 - one
118:45 - so over here let's run it locally try it
118:48 - out and see if it works and hopefully
118:50 - that won't return okay and hopefully
118:52 - that will
118:54 - take the things Okay so
118:58 - let's get the set game state with a post
119:02 - so let's see if that one does work so
119:06 - going to this URL that's all it takes
119:07 - all right
119:10 - let me just go into the storage
119:15 - okay so this is the current state just
119:17 - has an x on the left side now in order
119:19 - to be able to make a move I need to be
119:21 - playing as player B so once you're down
119:25 - so let's see if this one updates The
119:26 - Blob so that one made a move on there
119:28 - now this one I'll make it move on there
119:31 - and now if I quit the game and I play
119:33 - again let's see and let's see
119:35 - oh boy and yep there you go all right
119:39 - awesome
119:41 - okay seems unanimous what dark mode yeah
119:44 - yeah I know that I'm the outlier by
119:47 - by using light mode but well what can I
119:51 - say that's the way that my that my eyes
119:53 - work they bleed if I use dark mode so
119:56 - sorry nope can't do it
119:58 - okay so awesome so this is the only
120:00 - thing missing here is really just
120:02 - periodically updating the game state
120:06 - so yeah for that one I can actually use
120:08 - a function from my utilities so that's
120:10 - one
120:12 - and let's go up here let's make a
120:15 - function periodic let's create a
120:17 - function periodic going to do something
120:21 - and that something is going to be what
120:24 - and let's say every one second Maybe
120:29 - Okay so
120:32 - right I need to put some buttons as well
120:34 - and something like that anyways okay uh
120:37 - right so on the function periodic I'm
120:39 - going to
120:42 - get the game State and upload it right
120:46 - that's all it takes right I'm trying to
120:48 - think is that way too simple
120:50 - no I think that is correct
120:54 - so I go there I periodically download it
120:56 - and then if it's my move then I can
120:58 - place my move if it's not then I can
121:00 - okay so I generally think that is all
121:03 - that it takes
121:04 - again that sounds way too simple but I
121:07 - do think that this simple demo
121:11 - should work okay great so the final
121:14 - thing that I want is just some input to
121:16 - select the player so that I can make a
121:18 - proper build
121:19 - so on selecting team I'm going to set
121:23 - this player
121:26 - equals player.a
121:29 - and on pressing y
121:31 - I'm going to select player dot b okay
121:36 - so
121:37 - and let's make a can I make a
121:40 - serialized field private just make a
121:44 - simple visual using TM Pro
121:48 - and up here A type text mesh Pro ugly uh
121:53 - player text mesh Pro
121:56 - on right and then when I click let's go
121:58 - dot text equals a
122:02 - and on this one B just to make a quick
122:05 - debug visual
122:07 - uh
122:10 - right so let's just make that one
122:14 - right I still gotta clean up the floor
122:16 - so that's another thing that I still
122:18 - need to do but on D1 let's make a text
122:20 - text mesh Pro let's Anchor It To The Top
122:23 - put it on zero zero maybe a bit down
122:28 - just Dash zero zero put it in bold maybe
122:32 - with 40 and with that another okay
122:35 - actually why am I using A and B that
122:38 - doesn't actually make any sense I'm
122:40 - using amb instead of crosses and things
122:42 - that would make a lot more sense so
122:44 - let's put X and then o that makes a lot
122:47 - more sense
122:48 - okay right so
122:51 - I think this little mini demo of
122:53 - asynchronous multiplayer I think this
122:55 - one
122:56 - should hopefully be working so let's
122:59 - just drag the lucky canvas the text
123:02 - object
123:04 - okay
123:05 - I don't like it over there on the let's
123:07 - put it on that corner
123:09 - it's a bit more to the side
123:12 - like this in the same it's going to say
123:14 - an X so let's put it
123:16 - and higher and a bit or all right that
123:19 - looks good okay
123:22 - all right so let's see
123:25 - which was FPS dots button I mean okay
123:27 - yeah sure I can show it although over
123:29 - here on this basic
123:31 - thing doesn't really make much sense oh
123:33 - boy this is the issue yeah I definitely
123:36 - got a Hitman cleanup otherwise it's
123:37 - going to be constantly spawning more and
123:39 - more objects so let's just quickly
123:42 - handle cleanup
123:44 - so for that let's go here
123:47 - let's store just a simple
123:50 - transform and transform in a list of
123:54 - transform
123:57 - so the spawned what did I call Objects
124:01 - spawn objects list
124:03 - okay and I'll avoid yeah I should be
124:06 - doing this on on
124:08 - awake not on start so let's say this one
124:12 - is a new one
124:15 - put down and put down
124:20 - okay all right so I've got the spawned
124:24 - objects list so when I do instantiates
124:27 - with transform brief uh transformed and
124:31 - let's add
124:32 - this one
124:35 - and then up here I've got to do the
124:39 - prefab transform equals Zone spawn it to
124:42 - the list then when updating the state
124:44 - let's cycle through it
124:46 - transform
124:48 - object transform and the spawned object
124:52 - list and over here let's destroy the
124:55 - spawn object transform.game object and
124:58 - then let's clear the list
125:00 - all right good great
125:04 - so
125:05 - [Music]
125:07 - let's see if this one does work
125:13 - and all right so yeah it is no longer
125:16 - spawning an infinite number of objects
125:18 - okay that's great
125:20 - right so
125:23 - yeah like this everything is already
125:24 - working so
125:27 - if I yeah I just didn't test the setting
125:29 - the thing so
125:32 - if I click on T and yep I can swap it
125:36 - okay great all right so let's try making
125:39 - a proper build I just need to add this
125:42 - open scene and get rid of all the other
125:45 - ones
125:52 - all right so let's try making a build on
125:55 - this
125:57 - [Music]
125:58 - let's try a new
126:01 - builds let's make a windows down this
126:04 - one all right
126:06 - okay so I think
126:07 - yeah I think this little demo
126:09 - is already working do you get take game
126:12 - State yeah
126:13 - there's a simple 1B it should be working
126:15 - [Music]
126:18 - okay right so
126:20 - of water yeah
126:22 - quick test then yeah
126:24 - oh
126:27 - boy all right
126:31 - okay
126:36 - what do you have planned for tomorrow
126:38 - uh are you asking about a live stream
126:40 - now we're only planning on live stream
126:42 - tomorrow that is
126:43 - that would be a bit too much two live
126:45 - streams two days in a row but yeah
126:46 - definitely want to do another one who
126:48 - knows maybe next week something like
126:51 - that
126:51 - yeah is this for the next video no I'm
126:54 - um I still got a lot of work to make
126:56 - before this one becomes a video this one
126:58 - about making cloud-based game mechanics
127:01 - so this one probably in I don't know two
127:03 - to three weeks I certainly got a lot of
127:05 - work to do on this one gotta prepare the
127:07 - rest of demos I gotta make uh I gotta
127:10 - write the video record and edit and so
127:12 - on so yeah maybe about three weeks but
127:14 - before that I'm going to post the uh
127:16 - Azure Basics and a basic Azure tutorial
127:19 - so
127:20 - if you're curious on the basic things of
127:22 - what I've been working on over here on
127:25 - this on this live stream then yeah a
127:27 - tutorial about that one will be coming
127:29 - soon not sure when but soon yeah
127:33 - all right
127:35 - making the first build always takes
127:37 - quite some time so let's see what's the
127:40 - next game you're going to release I'm
127:42 - not sure I definitely want to work on
127:44 - something I've wanted to
127:47 - um I wanted to start working on
127:49 - something on the second half of this
127:50 - year but then my turn-based course that
127:52 - took way much longer way much more work
127:54 - than expected so everything kind of was
127:57 - pushed a bit back but yeah definitely
128:00 - wouldn't like to
128:01 - like to work on my next steam game just
128:03 - need to find the time but hopefully soon
128:06 - what are your PC specs
128:08 - oh God I don't know I've got a
128:12 - a
128:14 - 6950 X
128:16 - the CPU for gpua 3090 I think that's a
128:20 - pretty nice PC pretty nice why is The
128:22 - Game's FPS fixed at 61 because I
128:25 - put it at
128:27 - 60 okay
128:29 - all right did I make it
128:31 - oh crap
128:33 - I did not make this resizable okay so I
128:36 - gotta
128:37 - yeah but the logic should let me just
128:40 - yeah because I don't like that
128:43 - uh for the resolution presentation no I
128:46 - don't want full screen I want it
128:47 - windowed yep
128:50 - uh right so let's make another build I
128:52 - guess
128:55 - okay hopefully the second one is faster
128:58 - so yeah
129:00 - have any tips for reading the code of
129:01 - strangers if it's not documented gets
129:03 - very hard yep it is very hard I mean if
129:06 - the code is not well written if it is
129:08 - not well documented then yeah I don't
129:10 - think there are any tips that it just
129:12 - you're at the mercy of the person who
129:14 - wrote the code if they wrote the code in
129:17 - a nice clean way then hopefully it is
129:19 - the read but if they didn't then yeah
129:21 - your job is definitely going to be very
129:23 - difficult so that is why I always talk
129:25 - about writing good clean code because if
129:27 - you do
129:29 - then Things become so much better both
129:31 - for you and for whoever else might
129:34 - see your code
129:36 - alright so over here now the player
129:37 - should be the player X so if I click
129:40 - over here nope this one's not doing
129:41 - anything and now these are two instances
129:43 - and they are not connected directly with
129:45 - multiplayer but they are connected
129:47 - through asynchronous multiplier through
129:48 - the cloud so when I press over here it
129:51 - should place a Crosshair and after about
129:53 - half a second it should show up across
129:55 - here so let's see click there it is and
129:58 - yep there it is okay I don't know why
130:00 - that one became broken but yep it did
130:02 - work so now if I click nope this one
130:04 - can't do anything and if I click this
130:06 - one and after a while okay I don't know
130:08 - why that one is disappearing but yep it
130:10 - does work I can place across
130:12 - and don't get why someone deleting that
130:14 - is so strange
130:18 - becoming yeah anyways but yeah it does
130:21 - work so I can place over there even
130:23 - though there's no win scenario so if I
130:24 - place there and I win and no technically
130:28 - I won but there's no Winston right but
130:29 - yeah it does work all right awesome
130:33 - so yeah the asynchronous multiplayer
130:35 - does work perfectly
130:38 - so the only other thing that I need yeah
130:42 - is just handling how to start a new game
130:44 - how to do something like that so
130:46 - yeah right now if I want to make a new
130:49 - game I've got to manually go up here
130:52 - can this yeah this one needs to reload
130:56 - because if I go into edit yep all of
130:58 - them got done and I've got to swap all
131:00 - of these out for twos
131:04 - okay if I do this now it should pretty
131:06 - much reset the game
131:08 - obviously if you were to use this kind
131:10 - of logic you would have to make one blog
131:13 - for each uh game scene game controller
131:16 - and so on but yeah
131:19 - but yeah all the logic is working so the
131:21 - demo that I want to make so this one
131:23 - plays as the circle this one as the
131:25 - cross so the circle does not do anything
131:27 - on start so I can do anything not the
131:29 - cross click make my move get no idea why
131:31 - no one is Vanishing but yep after a
131:33 - while this one receives now the circle
131:35 - make a move there and after a while that
131:37 - one receives now make a cross and after
131:40 - a while that one goes and I'll go there
131:43 - and I'll go there
131:45 - and I'll put one there
131:47 - and put one there and there you go gotta
131:49 - win all right awesome
131:52 - oh that was a a fun demo to work on and
131:55 - it does work so yeah this kind of thing
131:56 - as you might imagine you can very easily
131:58 - build upon this to make any kind of
132:01 - asynchronous multiplier so yeah even
132:03 - though this is a simple demo the kind of
132:05 - things that you could build with this
132:06 - kind of logic are pretty much infinite
132:08 - so anything in the scale of civilization
132:10 - any kind of game like that that requires
132:12 - asynchronous multiplayer
132:14 - this is definitely very interesting hey
132:16 - CPU yeah see you next time yeah it's
132:18 - definitely a time for unless you to end
132:20 - yeah I hope you all found this enjoyable
132:23 - yeah so this demo worked so for that
132:25 - video I need to make about four demos so
132:27 - during this live stream I managed to do
132:29 - two demos
132:30 - so that was fun so yeah
132:33 - okay I think that's gonna be it and just
132:35 - in case you didn't notice the the
132:37 - previous demo please save the stream Yep
132:40 - this one is indeed being saved Nissan
132:42 - machine learning nope I haven't used it
132:44 - so not sure if it has changed but yeah
132:48 - uh yeah the previous demo I've got a
132:50 - character the previous demo is all about
132:52 - making a workshop so if I press a button
132:54 - I contact the cloud and I'm downloading
132:57 - a character from the cloud was that the
132:59 - button no that was the button no not
133:01 - that one that one there you go down
133:03 - or no
133:05 - what was the button okay now there you
133:07 - go that's the button so Tom was an NPC
133:09 - from the cloud I can approach it
133:11 - downloads a Sprite sheet from the cloud
133:12 - I can interact and it says a message
133:14 - from the cloud
133:16 - all right so yeah this was a very
133:18 - productive live stream managed to do two
133:20 - demos so hopefully finishing that video
133:23 - should be doable all right
133:27 - okay so I think that's gonna be it can I
133:30 - publish games on scene without creating
133:31 - a company I mean you need to have some
133:33 - sort of legal entity so that's pretty
133:36 - much it so it doesn't have to be a
133:37 - company can be
133:38 - well I guess it depends on the country
133:40 - at least over here unfortunately you can
133:42 - work as an individual but anyways all
133:44 - right so yeah thank you all so much for
133:46 - joining me on this live stream this was
133:48 - interesting I hope you found it
133:49 - interesting and educational maybe you'll
133:51 - learn something and stay tuned for this
133:53 - video obviously the final video is much
133:55 - more much more let's say well presented
133:58 - than in live stream so much less
134:00 - rambling so yeah that should hopefully
134:02 - be interesting so if all of you want to
134:05 - make want to add some Cloud mechanics to
134:07 - your games hopefully that video should
134:09 - be interesting
134:11 - all right okay so that's gonna be it I
134:13 - really need to go and drink some water
134:16 - so let's just stop this and let's put up
134:19 - the background
134:21 - all right so yeah so everything's good
134:24 - okay great all right so yeah thank you
134:27 - all so much for being here I hope to be
134:29 - making some more live streams more
134:31 - regularly so hopefully who knows maybe
134:33 - middle of this week maybe next week
134:35 - that should be something all right so
134:37 - yeah once again thank you all for being
134:39 - here thank you all so much and I'll see
134:41 - you next time
134:51 - thank you
