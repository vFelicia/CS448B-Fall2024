00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - 2024 is here and the new year is always
00:04 - a great time for some personal
00:05 - reflection one year ago I made a nice
00:07 - video talking about goal setting in
00:09 - general and encouraging you to make your
00:10 - first game in 2023 I just watched it
00:12 - again it's still a really great video
00:14 - the advice here is really Timeless so if
00:16 - you haven't seen this one definitely go
00:17 - give it a watch in general my best tip
00:19 - on goal setting is simply write down
00:21 - your goals if you just do that if you
00:22 - just write down your goals at massively
00:24 - increase your chances of actually
00:25 - achieving those goals so if you watched
00:27 - this video one year ago I hope you wrote
00:29 - down your goals and I hope you achieved
00:30 - your 2023 goals then here I also talked
00:32 - about my own personal 2023 goals so
00:35 - let's go through them one by one and see
00:36 - if I achieve them I the find some really
00:38 - important primary goals then some
00:40 - interesting secondary goals and finally
00:42 - some fun personal fitness goals so let's
00:44 - go through them one by one and I'll try
00:46 - to come up with some general takeaways
00:47 - that should hopefully be helpful to you
00:49 - starting with the primary goals and
00:50 - starting with the very first one which
00:52 - was the goal to release total World
00:53 - Liberation on Steam this is the game
00:55 - that I announced all the way back in 22
00:58 - it's still a really interesting game
00:59 - with tons of interesting design logic
01:01 - it's kind of a mix of XCOM mixed with
01:03 - some automation elements and a
01:04 - persistent open world I'm still a huge
01:06 - fan of the idea that I have in my head
01:08 - however as you might know I pivoted away
01:10 - from this idea earlier this year I Bally
01:12 - realized that Total War Liberation this
01:14 - was going to take a massive amount of
01:15 - work to actually finish it was highly
01:17 - unlikely that I was going to be able to
01:18 - do with it in this year but still I
01:20 - really really wanted to publish another
01:21 - steam game in 23 my last one was battle
01:24 - round Tycoon which came out all the way
01:25 - back in 2019 that's way too long ago so
01:28 - I definitely really wanted to publish a
01:29 - game this year that's why in the
01:31 - beginning of this year I pivoted the way
01:32 - to a much SAR idea that I could actually
01:34 - produce in one year that turned out to
01:35 - be Deni Gardens which was indeed fully
01:37 - produced and fully developed and fully
01:39 - published this year it was quite
01:40 - stressful to build that game in just
01:42 - about 7 months but I'm still very happy
01:44 - with the final result I'm very happy
01:45 - with how it came out so while I
01:46 - technically did not achieve this goal I
01:48 - technically did not launch to one
01:50 - Liberation on Steam I did achieve the
01:51 - actual goal behind it which was to
01:53 - launch another game so yeah for this one
01:55 - I do consider it the success and now for
01:57 - 2024 the hope is to finally get back to
01:59 - to Liberation the takeaway from this one
02:01 - for you is to Simply know that it's okay
02:03 - to Pivot it's okay to analyze your plans
02:05 - and if something isn't going according
02:06 - to plan it's perfectly okay to adapt to
02:08 - a new plan I mean obviously don't just
02:10 - constantly pivot from idea to idea
02:12 - basically don't just constantly aband
02:13 - every idea as soon as it becomes
02:15 - difficult don't do that constantly but
02:17 - definitely do know that it's okay
02:18 - sometimes to adopt a plan once you
02:20 - analyze your current state then you see
02:21 - that things are a bit different than
02:22 - they were when you first originally made
02:24 - the plan then my second primary goal was
02:26 - to publish a free complete course and
02:28 - Yep this one was indeed a huge success I
02:30 - did manage to publish the course
02:31 - actually was two courses one on making
02:33 - it in single player and another one on
02:34 - multiplayer and thankfully the reception
02:36 - has been pretty excellent it is by far
02:39 - the most successful video on this
02:40 - channel with 1.8 million views and all
02:42 - the comments they are all extremely
02:43 - positive with tons of people really
02:45 - happy with knowledge included in this
02:46 - course they're really happy with how
02:48 - it's completely free and how it's really
02:49 - high quality personally I especially
02:51 - love how so many people really enjoy the
02:53 - focus on writing good clean code the
02:55 - course is not on just making a game but
02:56 - actually making it properly that was
02:58 - something very important to me and I'm
02:59 - really happy to see that people also
03:01 - value that reading the literal thousands
03:03 - of comments reading all of this has been
03:05 - wonderful and answering tons and tons of
03:07 - questions has been really great for my
03:08 - own personal journey to help me better
03:10 - improve in the ways that I teach and
03:11 - provide extra clarification on just
03:13 - about anything and of course I also like
03:15 - how despite the full video the full
03:16 - course being available over here for
03:18 - free on YouTube the full 10 hours
03:20 - despite that there were still over 400
03:22 - people who bought the completely
03:23 - optional paid version and a bunch more
03:25 - fired some super thanks on the video I
03:27 - invested a bunch of money in the course
03:29 - by actually hiring an artist to build
03:30 - all the assets getting musician for all
03:32 - the music just so I had the rights in
03:34 - order to be able to distribute them
03:35 - along with all the project files and
03:37 - thanks to these General people I did
03:38 - manage to break even on those costs and
03:40 - even made a little bit of money that was
03:41 - definitely not something that I expected
03:43 - based on a completely free course so I'm
03:44 - really happy with that it was the T of
03:46 - work to make these few courses the 17
03:48 - hours of excellent content so I'm really
03:50 - really happy with the very positive
03:51 - reception looking at this I definitely
03:53 - want to make some more free courses I
03:55 - have some interesting plans to mix both
03:57 - paid and free courses in 2024 so this
03:59 - should be a really interesting year in
04:01 - fact right now the next big project that
04:02 - I'm currently working on is a complete C
04:05 - course going everywhere from complete
04:07 - beginners to Advanced and I'm planning a
04:09 - similar plan trying to make it free with
04:11 - an optional paid version so stay tuned
04:13 - for that now this topic I'm not sure I
04:15 - can come up with a good General takeaway
04:17 - that is applicable unless you also have
04:18 - some kind of Channel teaching game
04:20 - development maybe the takeaway is
04:22 - sometimes it's good to do things just
04:23 - for the community as opposed to always
04:24 - for profit so perhaps the takeaway could
04:27 - be contribute to some open source
04:28 - software maybe if you have have some
04:29 - knowledge maybe Mentor some beginner or
04:31 - simply spend some time answering
04:33 - questions on Reddit or Discord so for
04:34 - this goal yep I can also consider this a
04:36 - massive success then the third primary
04:38 - goal making complete dots 1.0 course now
04:41 - for this one yeah it didn't really work
04:42 - out the reason is simply because I
04:44 - really really wanted to make a game this
04:45 - year and making dinky Guardians
04:47 - alongside keeping videos on this channel
04:50 - doing that was a huge challenge
04:51 - definitely more difficult definitely a
04:52 - lot more worth than I originally
04:54 - anticipated so I didn't have time for
04:56 - even more big projects other than these
04:57 - ones so technically this one did not
04:59 - work out although right now I actually
05:01 - just recently got back into dots I've
05:03 - been spending the last few weeks
05:04 - researching entities 1.2 to make another
05:06 - huge free tutorial I still have to
05:08 - record and edit this one this is going
05:09 - to be the next video on this channel so
05:11 - stay tuned maybe this Friday or Saturday
05:13 - and after I finish the C course the next
05:15 - big project that I want to make is
05:16 - indeed this Dot scor and speaking of
05:18 - that let me just ask you a similar
05:19 - question on making a DOT scor what kind
05:21 - of game would you like to see made I've
05:23 - got a bunch of ideas for genres that I
05:25 - think would be useful to make something
05:26 - using dots but I still haven't decided
05:28 - on anything so do let me know your
05:30 - thoughts on the comments and the general
05:31 - takeaway from this topic General
05:33 - takeaway is really based on the fact
05:34 - that I failed this primary goal and the
05:36 - takeaway for you is simply don't be too
05:37 - hard on yourself if you eventually don't
05:39 - complete your goals personally I could
05:41 - be really upset at myself right now for
05:42 - not achieving this goal but really two
05:44 - things come to mind number one I know
05:46 - the reason why I couldn't do it is
05:48 - perfectly valid I was already working on
05:49 - a game and a ton more stuff so it was
05:51 - literally impossible for me to work on
05:52 - another big project on top of everything
05:54 - that I did and more importantly number
05:55 - two is I simply know that would not be
05:57 - helpful punishing yourself when you
05:59 - don't acheve achieve a goal is really
06:00 - not a good use of your time and energy
06:02 - if you quote unquote fail to achieve a
06:04 - goal just like I did then simply accept
06:06 - that and move on there's simply no point
06:08 - in punishing yourself and dwelling in
06:09 - the past just move on and try to achieve
06:11 - that goal in the future which is exactly
06:12 - my plan exactly what I'm going to do in
06:14 - 2024 so out of my primary goals I
06:16 - managed to achieve two of them and I
06:17 - failed one of them so I think that's a
06:19 - pretty good result I'm definitely happy
06:21 - about this then on the secondary goals
06:23 - first of all make more live streams I
06:25 - just checked the numbers and I ended up
06:26 - doing exactly the same amount that I did
06:28 - in the previous year I did a total of 10
06:30 - live streams throughout the year so it
06:32 - didn't quite work out but still I
06:33 - wouldn't call this a Miss while I could
06:35 - have done better I do think this was a
06:36 - pretty decent result honestly for me
06:38 - making live streams is still quite
06:39 - stressful I am very much an introvert
06:41 - and just being here facing a camera this
06:43 - is still quite stressful still quite
06:44 - intimidating thankfully I have gotten
06:46 - quite a bit better at just this
06:48 - recording to a camera but doing it live
06:50 - is a whole different thing so the fact
06:52 - that I push through it and still managed
06:53 - to do 10 live streams I'm pretty happy
06:54 - with that although this goal I'm
06:56 - definitely keeping it for 2024 I would
06:58 - really love to one day get to the point
07:00 - where I can easily make a live stream
07:01 - every week and keep a nice regular
07:02 - schedule speaking of schedule the next
07:04 - goal was keep a regular video schedule
07:06 - so the goal was to continue posting two
07:08 - to three times per week and on this one
07:09 - yep I definitely did achieve this one
07:11 - honestly I'm pretty impressed with
07:12 - myself I'm pretty happy with the fact
07:13 - that I achieved this goal again because
07:15 - I spent so much of this year working on
07:17 - both the free courses and on thinky
07:18 - Guardians like I said it was really
07:20 - tricky really stressful working on the
07:22 - game and making regular videos at the
07:23 - same time in total I think I made 160
07:26 - videos this year and even though I
07:27 - grossly underestimated the amount of to
07:29 - be able to do this whilst making a game
07:31 - at the same time even though I still
07:33 - managed to achieve both of those so I'm
07:34 - really happy with myself although in
07:35 - 2024 one of my goals is to hopefully
07:37 - have a bit more of a balanced life
07:39 - rather than working non-stop the whole
07:41 - year and one of the things that
07:42 - supposedly helps me with that is what
07:43 - was one of my secondary goals her and
07:45 - editor and Y this year I did experiment
07:47 - with a bunch of editors and the
07:49 - experiment has been pretty successful
07:51 - now I still edit most of my videos I
07:52 - would say maybe about 70% of them that
07:54 - is techly still quite a bit high but it
07:56 - is less than 100% which was the case for
07:58 - the past 4 years years so compared to
08:00 - that I would say it's going pretty good
08:02 - hiring an editor gives me a bit more
08:03 - time which I can then dedicate to make
08:05 - more complex videos or simply have a
08:07 - little bit of time offs the next goal
08:09 - was hit 500k subs and if this one was
08:11 - awesome I did manage to achieve this one
08:13 - right after unite so really thank you
08:14 - all so much for watching the videos and
08:16 - subscribing to the channel it's honestly
08:18 - really insane for me to imagine 500,000
08:20 - people clicking that button these past 5
08:22 - years have definitely been crazy I'm
08:24 - really happy with this journey and I
08:25 - really hope you've learned a ton from
08:26 - the videos so thank you all so much for
08:28 - being here I do love doing this and I
08:30 - definitely plan to continue doing it for
08:32 - many many years in the future who knows
08:34 - hopefully in a few years I'll hit the 1
08:35 - million Mark then the next goal hit 50
08:37 - million views this one not quite but
08:39 - kind of almost got it the current total
08:41 - is 47 million so we should be able to
08:43 - hit that within the next 3 to four
08:44 - months in terms of views at the channel
08:45 - technically didn't grow too much but in
08:47 - terms of watch time that one did
08:48 - increase by quite a bit some like a 40%
08:51 - increase probably a lot due to the free
08:53 - 10hour course so this one technically
08:55 - didn't hit it but still very happy with
08:56 - the current growth in the channel and
08:58 - then finally something very personal are
08:59 - my fitness goals like I've mentioned
09:01 - several times is something that is
09:02 - really important to me and I really
09:04 - think it's one of the main reasons why
09:05 - even though I work way too much I still
09:07 - haven't suffered from burnout I work
09:08 - non-stop 7 days a week with no vacations
09:10 - holidays or even weekends and the two
09:12 - reasons why I can do that without
09:13 - burning out is well first of all it's
09:15 - actually my dogs I love going with them
09:17 - on regular walks that really helps me
09:19 - disconnect a bit from my PC and secondly
09:21 - my gym time which I really don't
09:22 - sacrifice for anything it is really
09:23 - extremely important to me in order to be
09:25 - able to continue functioning so for
09:26 - these goals first of all hit a new
09:28 - deadli PR and for this one I didn't
09:30 - actually hit it I didn't Focus too much
09:31 - on deadlift this year and I haven't
09:33 - really tried going for an uppr in a
09:35 - while I did a few sets a few weeks ago
09:37 - with 175 kilos and that one felt pretty
09:39 - good so if I tried maybe I could get a
09:41 - uppr then on the bench the goal was to
09:43 - get a new PR back then my absolute Max
09:45 - was 110 kilos and this one Yep this one
09:47 - I did manage to achieve it just a few
09:49 - weeks ago I did two reps with 115 and
09:52 - that felt pretty good the bar was moving
09:53 - nice it was controlling that was great
09:55 - lately I've been doing sets of eight
09:57 - with 100 kilos which a few years ago
09:58 - this was was my dream to be able to get
10:00 - to the point where I could reliably do
10:01 - sets of eight with 100 kilos with two
10:03 - plates and Y right now I can definitely
10:05 - do that for me the bench was honestly
10:07 - usually not my favorite exercise but
10:08 - lately this year this has definitely
10:10 - been something that I've been loving the
10:11 - next goal was run 20 km now just before
10:14 - I Define these goals for 2023 just
10:16 - before this I had run my first NK race
10:18 - ever so back then the goal was to run 20
10:20 - km and Y this one was definitely a
10:22 - massive success back in March I did join
10:24 - the enison half marathon and I did
10:26 - manage to complete it then I did a ton
10:28 - of train
10:29 - almost ran 1,000 kilm this past year and
10:32 - in October literally just one week after
10:33 - launching my game d Gardens I did the El
10:36 - leson full marathon and I did manage to
10:37 - complete it I mean I did pretty much Lim
10:39 - to the Finish Line I was all messed up
10:41 - for the last 10 kilm but I did go past
10:43 - the Finish Line my total time was 5
10:45 - hours and 7 minutes so definitely a lot
10:47 - of room to improve but I'm very happy
10:49 - with this result and the final one hit
10:50 - 10% body fat honestly I've had this goal
10:53 - for the past some like seven years and
10:54 - this one nope I definitely did not
10:56 - achieve it personally I have a lot of
10:57 - trouble with food control and despite
10:59 - running a ton last year I still managed
11:01 - to eat way too more than I ran lowest I
11:03 - got was probably 15.5% body fat with
11:05 - about 81 kilos I have to say when I
11:07 - first started going to gym seriously
11:09 - that was about 7 years ago and that was
11:10 - when I learned about the concept of
11:11 - bonking and of course as soon as I saw
11:13 - that I definitely love that concept
11:15 - right away basically you're tell me I
11:16 - can eat whatever I want and I'm going to
11:18 - be able to put on muscle and that's
11:19 - actually a good thing I was around 76
11:21 - kills back then I thought that was
11:23 - awesome so I just ate everything I could
11:24 - find and in about 3 months I went from
11:26 - 76 to almost 90 and I have pretty much
11:28 - say buol up ever since I'm always going
11:30 - between 82 and 84 so this goal of
11:33 - hitting 10% this has been my constant
11:35 - goal for the past few years and I still
11:36 - haven't hit it but hopefully 2024 is the
11:38 - final year on this topic of Fitness I
11:40 - highly highly encourage you to do
11:42 - something you don't have to take it as
11:43 - seriously as I do personally I love it
11:45 - so I do it a lot but you can just do
11:47 - something basic just something like 45
11:48 - minutes three times a week that is more
11:50 - than enough if you just do that that
11:51 - will give you a ton of benefits and you
11:53 - don't have to do lifting there's a
11:55 - million ways to train so just find what
11:56 - you enjoy the most especially
11:58 - considering how Game Dev programming
12:00 - these are very sedentary jobs you are
12:02 - sitting all the time so combining that
12:04 - with some physical fitness I think that
12:05 - is extremely important personally I want
12:07 - to keep making games by the time I'm 80
12:09 - so I definitely take this part quite
12:10 - seriously so looking at this whole list
12:12 - I'm quite happy with the results I did
12:13 - manage to hit most of my goals like I
12:15 - said the original video is great and on
12:17 - the topic of goals this advice is really
12:19 - Timeless so I definitely encourage you
12:20 - to go watch this video and title that I
12:22 - made for the video was make your first
12:23 - game in 2023 so let me ask you did you
12:26 - make your first game in 2023 did you
12:28 - achieve your goals both your
12:29 - professional and your personal goals I
12:31 - really hope you had a great 2023 and I
12:34 - really hope you have a successful 2024
12:36 - personally I'm very much looking forward
12:37 - to all the projects that I have planned
12:38 - for 2024 so once again thank you so much
12:41 - for watching and I'll see you next time
