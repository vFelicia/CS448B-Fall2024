00:02 - hi there this is a quick tip for how to
00:04 - coin a UI transform so let's say I want
00:07 - to set up a list of guests here's the
00:09 - transform that I want to clone there's a
00:11 - name and the e bar one way you could do
00:13 - it is obviously by making this into a
00:15 - prefab however that would add another
00:18 - file into your project list which would
00:20 - be unnecessary given that this is really
00:22 - only used in this particular window so
00:24 - having multiple prefabs related to
00:26 - multiple different windows could become
00:28 - quite confusing so what I normally do is
00:30 - create a transform in the editor just
00:32 - like this and then I clone it through
00:34 - code so in the code I first grab a
00:36 - reference to the template then I set the
00:41 - game objects that active to false in
00:43 - order to be hidden and then whenever I
00:45 - need it I instantiate it and I set the
00:51 - knee only created set active back to
00:54 - true then I can set the position and all
00:56 - the fields that I want so I can put this
01:06 - in the loop in order to make multiple
01:08 - and just like that there's the template
01:11 - being in Senshi ated multiple times
01:12 - there to fill up our list so now I'd say
01:14 - I want to add something else to each
01:16 - entry all I need to do is modify the
01:18 - template and just like that I have an
01:22 - icon and now in the code when I sin she
01:25 - ate now I can change that icon for
01:27 - whatever I want and just like that by
01:33 - modifying the template I have modified
01:35 - what gets created and I now have another
01:36 - feeling that I can easily use so another
01:39 - usage would be for example for buttons
01:40 - seen here I have the first button and I
01:42 - want to add a couple more and here we
01:44 - can copy this code into its own function
02:04 - so here I have a nice number function in
02:06 - order to help me clone and position a
02:08 - transform I use it to fill with a list
02:11 - and here I use it to duplicate the
02:13 - buttons so I only create one button in
02:15 - the editor and then I duplicate them in
02:17 - the code and do whatever I want with
02:19 - them so I think any of their it is on my
02:22 - guest list all following the same
02:24 - template and the same thing for the
02:25 - buttons I only defined one the editor
02:27 - and then I created the other two
02:28 - dynamically and that's it hope you found
