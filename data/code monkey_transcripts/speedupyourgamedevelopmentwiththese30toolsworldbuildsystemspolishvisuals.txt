00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - as you know the ssor has tons of awesome
00:04 - tools and assets to help you in every
00:06 - way imaginable there's so much awesome
00:07 - stuff that it's impossible to keep track
00:09 - of it all so here let's look at about 20
00:11 - assets that can help you massively speed
00:13 - up development of your game and get
00:14 - something playable super quickly or just
00:16 - help you polish whatever you already
00:18 - have i organized all these assets into
00:20 - six distinct categories to help you in
00:22 - different ways i chose to highlight so
00:24 - many assets because there's lots of
00:26 - super useful ones but whether or not
00:28 - they are useful will depend on what kind
00:29 - of game and what genre you're making so
00:31 - regardless of the genre i'm sure that
00:33 - several of these 20 that i'm going to
00:35 - highlight can be a great help to you in
00:37 - speeding up development of your game and
00:38 - helping finish whatever project you're
00:40 - currently working on also this video is
00:42 - sponsored by unity okay so let's see how
00:44 - the ssr can help you speed up
00:46 - development i organized all of these
00:48 - assets into six discrete categories
00:50 - there's timestamps in the video and all
00:52 - of the assets are linked in the
00:53 - description quick mention unity right
00:55 - now is having a sale in a bunch of the
00:56 - assets mentioned in this video are on
00:58 - sale until next week then when this one
01:00 - ends there's another sale with even more
01:02 - assets discounted and in the last week
01:04 - the best of both sales will again get a
01:06 - discount so check the links below and if
01:08 - it's not on sale check again next week
01:10 - and make sure you use the coupon to get
01:12 - a bonus discount up to 15 percent more
01:14 - let's begin just briefly with the
01:15 - simplest most obvious category which are
01:17 - visual assets these are 3d models
01:20 - textures animations effects ui elements
01:22 - skyboxes and possibly even custom
01:24 - shaders for me as someone who has pretty
01:26 - much no artistic skill for me this is
01:28 - one of the main ways that i use the
01:29 - store so in my case it's more due to
01:32 - lack of skills rather than wanting to
01:33 - speed up development but even if you are
01:35 - a talented 3d modeler or animator it can
01:37 - still save you a ton of time to just buy
01:39 - something instead of building everything
01:41 - from scratch if you're a regular on the
01:43 - channel then you've certainly noticed
01:44 - how i use lots of different asset packs
01:46 - to make the videos look interesting i'm
01:48 - a huge fan of the cynthia lopez style
01:50 - it's what i normally use in my videos if
01:52 - you prefer something more realistic then
01:54 - a great publisher is infinity pvr
01:56 - they've got great models super high
01:58 - fidelity really high quality for some
02:00 - animations you can find pretty much
02:02 - anything you can think of you have some
02:04 - regular medieval sword swinging
02:05 - animations or some rifled pistol
02:07 - animations you can even find some more
02:09 - exotic things like parkour animations
02:11 - zombie animations even some gun katah
02:13 - animations another visual thing is
02:15 - simply textures if you just search for
02:17 - it you'll find just about everything
02:19 - some in a realistic style other is very
02:21 - cartoony effects is another super simple
02:23 - way to really speed up development just
02:25 - add a gorgeous explosion to your game
02:27 - and it will instantly look much better
02:29 - you can find ui elements there's also
02:31 - skyboxes you'd be surprised at how big
02:33 - of a difference it makes to just swap
02:35 - out the default skybox and also tons of
02:37 - shaders especially useful if you want to
02:39 - make your game look kind of cel-shaded
02:40 - but you're not a shader programmer just
02:42 - pick up one of these and now really
02:44 - visuals but in a similar category are
02:46 - sounds there's lots of sound effects and
02:48 - musics on store so that's the first
02:50 - category for me as a programmer with no
02:52 - artistic skill this is the main way that
02:54 - i use the store but even if you do have
02:56 - those artistic skills it can be super
02:58 - helpful to just buy something and
02:59 - massively speed up your development for
03:01 - the next category that can really help
03:03 - you make your game faster are some
03:04 - complete game builder tools there's tons
03:07 - of these for pretty much all genres you
03:09 - can think of and pretty much all of
03:10 - these have excellent documentation to
03:12 - help you learn how the tool works
03:14 - usually these are pretty massive tools
03:15 - that have tons of systems and some
03:17 - really easy ways to implement all the
03:19 - features of that particular genre for
03:21 - example here is the rpg builder it's one
03:23 - of the highest rated assets on the store
03:25 - it even won a unity award this one lets
03:27 - you easily make a full-fledged rpg it
03:29 - features a quest system a combo system
03:32 - you can easily define factions action
03:34 - abilities enemy and npc ai you can make
03:36 - some talent trees stats and tons more or
03:38 - perhaps you want to make a top-down game
03:40 - for that you have the top-down engine
03:43 - supports both 2d and 3d really solid
03:45 - character controller includes an
03:47 - inventory system super easy level
03:49 - creation with moving platforms you can
03:51 - add some loot systems some keys and
03:52 - doors on top of that it's also
03:54 - multiplayer ready maybe you want to make
03:56 - a colony survival game so here is a
03:58 - colony simulator features building and
04:00 - resource crafting you can select
04:02 - colonists and automate their actions
04:04 - it has an inventory system equipment and
04:07 - weapons individual stats tech tree day
04:09 - night cycle and many more or perhaps you
04:11 - prefer making an rts if so then check
04:13 - out the rts engine easily handle tons of
04:16 - units on custom made maps you can give
04:18 - them commands it handles combat you can
04:20 - easily construct buildings get resources
04:22 - and make more units for making
04:23 - platformers you have the corgi engine
04:25 - works in both 2d and 2 and a half d
04:28 - it's got a super tight controller that
04:30 - feels great to play it's packed with
04:31 - over 50 demo levels includes camera and
04:34 - parallax dialog engine and inventory you
04:36 - can easily build levels with some
04:38 - gravity zones a bunch of jumpers cannons
04:40 - you can add destructible crates win
04:42 - letters and tons more or maybe you want
04:44 - to make a visual novel so for that here
04:46 - you have nanny novel it's designed for
04:49 - script writers it lets you focus on
04:51 - writing stories and not writing code
04:53 - features a text printer you can skip you
04:55 - can add character voicing transitions
04:57 - conditional story flow and tons more
04:59 - then there's even a bunch more assets
05:01 - for all kinds of genres so as you can
05:03 - see the assessor has lots of massive
05:05 - game builder tools to really help you
05:07 - quickly build the game in whatever genre
05:08 - you can think of for the next category
05:11 - it's something that pretty much most
05:12 - games need you need controllers for
05:14 - controlling whatever object you want
05:16 - like the player a car perhaps in third
05:19 - or first person and so on building your
05:21 - own controller is extremely time
05:22 - consuming it's simple to get something
05:24 - basic working but making something
05:26 - proper that can handle every scenario in
05:27 - your game making that is really complex
05:30 - so these controller assets can
05:31 - definitely save you a ton of time
05:33 - you have general controllers like the
05:35 - excellent free unity official star
05:37 - assets there's one in first person and
05:39 - one in third person for something more
05:41 - advanced you have this highly capable
05:43 - kinematic character controller easily
05:45 - handles all the terrain that you can
05:46 - throw at it you can go over slopes you
05:49 - can jump you can push physics objects
05:51 - around get on moving platforms walk on
05:54 - uneven terrain and much more it's even
05:56 - made with networking in mind for easy
05:58 - multiplayer for making a third person
06:00 - shooter here's an excellent highly rated
06:01 - controller this one is extremely modular
06:04 - and has tons of integrations and add-ons
06:06 - so it's almost kind of like a game
06:08 - bundle tool rather than just a
06:09 - controller but still it's a very solid
06:11 - character controller for third person
06:13 - shooter games for first-person shooters
06:15 - here's a great one you can quickly get
06:17 - an fps character up and running with a
06:19 - flexible accuracy and recoil system
06:22 - it features lots of scope types
06:23 - depending on your needs you can add some
06:25 - laser pointers and flashlights it also
06:27 - supports guided projectiles with various
06:29 - targeting systems
06:31 - and it even has parker support with some
06:33 - long running crowd slides and mentally
06:35 - if you're making a card game then this
06:36 - card controller can save you tons of
06:38 - time it's very high rated with tons of
06:40 - demo scenes features user-friendly
06:43 - editor scripts with tons of parameters
06:44 - for you to customize and also many
06:47 - pre-built prefabs you just drag and drop
06:49 - and it just works or perhaps you're
06:51 - working on a space game so for that here
06:52 - is the sci-fi ship controller you can
06:54 - easily create spaceships you can create
06:56 - airplanes hovercrafts and tons more so
06:58 - basically anything that can fly
07:01 - it's all physics driven comes with a
07:02 - wide range of options for ship flight
07:04 - mechanics you can add all kinds of
07:06 - flight assists aerodynamics damage
07:08 - models and lots more so like i said just
07:10 - about any game needs a controller and
07:12 - picking up one of these will save you a
07:13 - massive amount of time the next category
07:16 - is world building tools these are all
07:18 - kinds of tools that can really help you
07:20 - build massive worlds super quickly you
07:22 - have to also help out with world
07:24 - generation others to help you place down
07:26 - some objects and populate your world one
07:28 - of the biggest ones for this is gaia
07:30 - this one has been in active development
07:32 - for literally years it has over a
07:34 - thousand five star reviews really it's a
07:36 - massive tool for all of your world
07:38 - building needs you can easily generate
07:40 - worlds and look really awesome you can
07:42 - make them fully procedural or artists
07:43 - driven includes films for terraforming
07:46 - placing down trees defining biomes and
07:48 - much more this can really help you make
07:50 - some gorgeous massive whirls in hours or
07:52 - days instead of taking weeks or months
07:54 - if you prefer something more simple here
07:56 - is yet another prefab painter that's
07:58 - later in the name it does exactly what
08:00 - you expect you define some prefabs and
08:02 - easily paint and place them in your
08:04 - scenes it includes physics support so
08:06 - you can just drop some objects and place
08:08 - them really naturally
08:09 - perhaps your game is city based so here
08:11 - is a fantastic city generator easily
08:14 - generates some massive really convincing
08:16 - realistic cities automatically places
08:19 - down some buildings roads trees it can
08:21 - place down sidewalks crosshalls and just
08:23 - about everything that a city requires
08:25 - contains over 300 unique buildings and
08:27 - even has a full-fledged traffic system
08:30 - or maybe your game design requires caves
08:32 - and overhangs so here's a great tone for
08:34 - that you can take your terrain and
08:36 - easily dig some holes in it it's very
08:38 - easy to use you just click and dig it's
08:40 - super fast and best of all this works in
08:42 - real time so you can let your players
08:45 - customize their world and as the terrain
08:47 - is modified it also updates in navmesh
08:49 - so both your players and the ai can
08:50 - navigate these new caves these rom
08:53 - building tools can definitely help you
08:54 - save a ton of time possibly in the order
08:56 - of months so if you want to build in
08:58 - populate a game world definitely look
09:00 - into one of these instead of manually
09:01 - placing down game objects next up we
09:03 - have the category for systems and tools
09:06 - this one is a pretty broad category
09:08 - there's tons of tools that do so many
09:10 - things that can save you a monumental
09:12 - amount of time
09:13 - let's start with the obvious one the
09:14 - odin inspector i made a full review
09:17 - video on this one including a quick
09:18 - getting started tutorial it's a really
09:20 - awesome tool for building tools so
09:22 - depending on how you use it this one can
09:24 - definitely save you hundreds or
09:25 - thousands of hours
09:27 - then pretty much every game is going to
09:28 - need some kind of save system so
09:30 - something like easy save can save you
09:32 - many hours from trying to build it
09:33 - yourself
09:34 - you can serialize and save just about
09:36 - any data you can save it on a file or
09:38 - save it on the cloud
09:40 - it enables compression encryption and
09:42 - you can do just about anything related
09:44 - to saving and loading it even works
09:46 - without code so it integrates really
09:47 - well with playmaker bond or unity visual
09:50 - scripting using this asset instead of
09:52 - building your own safe system will
09:53 - certainly save you a ton of time also
09:55 - pretty much every game will have
09:56 - pathfinding you have the built-in unity
09:59 - nav mesh which is very good for what it
10:00 - is
10:01 - but if your game has more intense or
10:03 - unique pathfinding needs then check out
10:05 - the a-star pathfinding project almost
10:07 - every one of my steam games uses this
10:09 - asset when you enable multi-threading
10:11 - it's insanely fast it's pretty much free
10:13 - even in my game hyper nights where i
10:15 - could have over 1000 units on screen
10:17 - even in that one the pathfinding was
10:19 - still insanely fast
10:20 - i also did a detailed review on this one
10:22 - if you want to learn more and yet
10:24 - another great one that i've also
10:25 - reviewed is quantum console
10:27 - it's a super easy way to add a console
10:29 - to your game with just one attribute you
10:31 - can call functions from your in-game
10:33 - console this can massively help you
10:35 - speed up testing for example you're
10:37 - making a first person shooter game and
10:39 - you're testing something then suddenly
10:41 - you run out of ammo well you can just
10:43 - make a command to set the ammo and
10:44 - that's it so there's no need for custom
10:47 - debug code or some special keys to
10:49 - trigger debug commands
10:50 - you just use this asset open up the
10:52 - console and type the commands now i'm
10:54 - probably biased about this next one but
10:56 - you can use my own free health system
10:58 - instead of building one from scratch
11:00 - it's what i've used in every single
11:01 - video on this channel where i needed
11:02 - some health and it's used in pretty much
11:04 - all of my steam games it's basic and
11:06 - does exactly what you expect it stores
11:08 - health has a bunch of functions to
11:10 - interact with it and some events keeping
11:11 - the whole thing nice and clean so there
11:13 - are a ton of systems and tools that can
11:15 - really have a massive effect on your
11:17 - efficiency there's no need to build
11:19 - everything from scratch yourself and for
11:21 - the final category we have polish as you
11:23 - might have heard me say polish is what
11:25 - separates good games from great games
11:27 - adding that tiny bit of polish makes a
11:28 - massive difference so if you want your
11:30 - game to be as great as it can be then
11:32 - there's a bunch of polish tools to
11:33 - really help you do that one of the main
11:35 - ones that is all about polish is called
11:37 - feel like the name implies this one
11:39 - helps make your game feel awesome you
11:41 - can very easily add all kinds of screen
11:43 - shake add zooms color changes and so on
11:46 - adding some tiny animation or feedback
11:48 - to just about any player action will
11:49 - massively improve just how good your
11:51 - game feels i made a full review video on
11:53 - this one in that video i also made a
11:55 - quick getting started tutorial and took
11:57 - a really basic scene from boring to
11:59 - awesome in just a few minutes using this
12:00 - asset so it can definitely save you a
12:02 - ton of time if instead you want to
12:04 - handle those animations yourself and you
12:06 - just want a simple tool to tween some
12:08 - valleys then check out dutween it's very
12:10 - simple to take any film that you have
12:12 - define some sort of target and
12:14 - interpolate in any way you want you can
12:16 - use all kinds of curves to make the
12:17 - tweening exactly as you want it then if
12:19 - your game has shooting or any actions
12:21 - that should damage the environment then
12:23 - check out brayfire this one is a really
12:25 - awesome tool i love the results that
12:27 - this produces it makes for some really
12:29 - gorgeous destruction you have tons of
12:31 - control for how exactly you want the
12:33 - destruction to behave and many many ways
12:35 - to tweak the performance you can even
12:37 - get it working on mobile i also made a
12:39 - phone review on this one i really
12:40 - enjoyed using it to massively polish a
12:42 - simple third person shooter to something
12:44 - that looks and feels really awesome
12:46 - then static text is usually pretty
12:48 - boring so if your game has lots of text
12:50 - then check out the text animator it
12:52 - massively improves the feeling of your
12:54 - game by adding all sorts of tiny
12:55 - animations to your text you can make it
12:58 - shake you can animate it change color
13:00 - you can also apply it to just certain
13:01 - letters or words so if your character
13:03 - says something like i'm really angry you
13:05 - can make just the word angry shake in a
13:07 - really intense manner again another
13:09 - thing that will really make your game
13:10 - feel punished and professional and with
13:12 - this asset you can add it to your game
13:14 - pretty easily then i should also mention
13:16 - my own asset the mouse cursor system pro
13:18 - this one is a super easy way to add
13:20 - custom animated cursor to your game so
13:22 - you can modify the default boring arrow
13:24 - cursor and replace it with something
13:25 - much more interesting you can even make
13:27 - that cursor animated it's a tiny thing
13:30 - but it can really make your game stand
13:31 - out and also help your players learn how
13:33 - your game works without needing a
13:35 - dedicated tutorial for example if you
13:37 - mouse over an enemy and the cursor turns
13:39 - to a red crosshair then it's pretty
13:40 - intuitive that it means some kind of an
13:42 - attack if you mouse over an object and
13:44 - the cursor changes to a hand then it's
13:46 - pretty clear you can pick it up so
13:48 - obviously i'm biased about my own asset
13:49 - but it does exactly what you want in a
13:51 - super easy to use asset once again
13:53 - polish is what separates good games from
13:55 - great games and these tools can help you
13:57 - push your game to that level in a pretty
13:59 - short amount of time alright so those
14:01 - are about 20 assets split into six
14:03 - categories that can really help you
14:04 - speed up development of your game i'm
14:06 - sure that several of these can be super
14:08 - useful regardless of whatever genre
14:10 - you're currently working on they're all
14:11 - linked in the description so check them
14:13 - out alright hope that's useful check out
14:15 - these videos to learn some more thanks
14:17 - to these awesome patreon supporters for
14:19 - making these videos possible thank you
14:21 - for watching and i'll see you next time
14:27 - [Music]
