00:11 - this video we're going to make a radar
00:13 - sweep effect we're going to have a bunch
00:15 - of enemies and items in our map and have
00:18 - a radar sweep through it and think when
00:20 - it locates something then in the end
00:21 - we're going to convert it into a UI
00:23 - minima let's begin
00:28 - [Music]
00:32 - okay so this is what we want to create
00:34 - over here we have a map with a whole
00:36 - bunch of enemies just randomly moving
00:38 - around as well as some items scattered
00:40 - throughout the map and if I press button
00:43 - there yo the enemies are now all hidden
00:45 - as if they had some sort of coding tech
00:47 - but they are still alive in the world
00:49 - and moving around
00:50 - I can also disable the items and disable
00:52 - the background so now everything looks
00:54 - black but if I enable the radar and
00:57 - there it is now I can see the radar
00:59 - sweeping through the area and triggering
01:00 - a nice ping whenever it hits an enemy or
01:03 - an item you can see the total radar
01:06 - range and you can see a different pink
01:08 - color based on whether it hit an enemy
01:11 - or a item so I can enable all the
01:14 - visuals and there you go as you can see
01:15 - there's an item in there and I mean
01:17 - there and as it goes past it it
01:18 - correctly identifies which one it is
01:21 - and with the keyboard I can also make it
01:23 - sweet faster or slower so just like that
01:25 - make it really fast any of there's a
01:28 - really nice radar effect so this is what
01:31 - we want for our radar effect and in the
01:34 - end we're going to convert it into a
01:35 - nice UI element like some sort of
01:37 - mini-map now you can see that I have my
01:39 - player I can move it around and I can
01:41 - look at the mini-map in order to
01:42 - identify what the radar is seen so there
01:45 - you go in here above me I have an item
01:47 - and if I enable the item visual there
01:50 - you go it is indeed in there and I can
01:52 - use the radar to locate it move up and
01:54 - capture the enemy and there are two more
01:55 - in here and yep there they are and just
01:58 - like that and I can also make the
02:00 - enemies invisible and there you go and
02:02 - they still show up on the radar so this
02:04 - can be used to detect cloaked enemies or
02:06 - maybe a special mini map that showed the
02:08 - location of hidden items or Easter eggs
02:10 - once you follow the tutorial and built
02:12 - this awesome effect you can make a WebGL
02:14 - build and publish it into your website

03:19 - alright so this is our goal let's get to
03:21 - it so here we are in our starting scene
03:24 - and if I hit play you can see enemy's
03:26 - just moving around randomly as well as
03:28 - some static items and if I press a
03:30 - button I can make the enemies invisible
03:32 - they still exist but they are hidden and
03:35 - if I press another button I can hide the
03:37 - items all right so this is our starting
03:39 - point now over here in the editor let's
03:42 - begin by making the visual for our radar
03:44 - so we begin with an empty game object
03:46 - and call it radar now inside let's make
03:50 - a 2d sprite and this will be our sweet
03:53 - we're going to drag the sweeps right in
03:56 - here the radar online okay here it is
04:03 - alright so this is the sprite that won't
04:05 - be rotating around as you can see the
04:08 - sprite in here on the import options you
04:09 - can already see that the pivot is on the
04:11 - left I'm so in here everything is set up
04:13 - for me to simply move these at Valley
04:16 - now let's also add another sprite for
04:19 - the background
04:25 - all right here is our nice background
04:27 - sprite and make sure that both of them
04:28 - have the same size so this one has half
04:31 - though okay great and now inside our
04:34 - sweep let's set another sprite and do
04:36 - some beat for the trail and drag this
04:39 - one and just like that we have a nice
04:42 - trail behind it now let's place them all
04:44 - on a new sorting layer so in here and
04:47 - let's call the radar okay
04:50 - now put them all on the radar now for
04:53 - the background let's leave you down
04:54 - backgrounds only we're at zero then we
04:56 - want the trail so let's put the trail at
04:58 - 10 and then we want to sweep on top so
05:00 - let's put it at 20 so here is everything
05:03 - nicely set up let's test and there you
05:06 - go there's our very nice visual we have
05:07 - a background a line and a trail and then
05:10 - we're going to simply be rotating here
05:12 - on these head and there you go that's
05:14 - how our radar moves right awesome so now
05:17 - that we have the visuals working let's
05:19 - get to work on our script down here on
05:21 - this folder make a new script call this
05:24 - our radar and drag it on to the game
05:27 - object there it is okay now in here
05:30 - let's begin by grabbing your reference
05:32 - to our sweep transform so we can rotate
05:33 - it alright so here we have our transform
05:42 - and a for testing will it simply start
05:44 - by making it rotate constantly so we
05:47 - need to go into our update and in here
05:49 - in order to rotate it we're going to
05:51 - take the sweep transform and modify the
05:53 - Euler angles we're going to modify with
05:57 - a new vector3 we're going to increase it
05:59 - with a 0 and the X here on the Y and the
06:01 - Z is what do we want to change so in
06:03 - here let's define a certain rotation
06:05 - speed and here we increase the Z by
06:12 - rotation speed multiplied by time dot
06:14 - off the time all right so just like this
06:17 - we should be able to see our radar
06:18 - rotating and here it is and it is indeed
06:21 - rotating except it's going
06:23 - counterclockwise as always unity when
06:26 - you increase an angle it goes
06:27 - counterclockwise so we need to decrease
06:29 - it in order to go
06:30 - quite so let's do that here just swap
06:32 - the Pumas for eight months and also
06:34 - let's make it a bit slower okay and if
06:37 - there's our radar now correctly rotating
06:39 - around okay great now let's see how we
06:42 - can actually find objects while sweeping
06:43 - now here on the update function first we
06:46 - rotate ok and then after rotating we're
06:49 - going to do a physics 2d and do a ray
06:52 - cast so we started off at our origin
06:55 - which is our transform position and then
06:57 - we need a direction so we need to
06:59 - convert our rotation in Euler angles
07:02 - into a vector two for the direction so
07:04 - for that I can use a nice function on
07:06 - the utilities as always you can download
07:11 - the utilities for free from in Tacoma
07:12 - calm and here is a function that takes a
07:15 - float and returns a vector three with
07:18 - our direction so if you want to
07:20 - implement yourself here it is
07:21 - so we complete the vector based on what
07:24 - we have on the Euler angles N and
07:27 - finally we need a distance so I draw
07:29 - here make a private phone for the radar
07:31 - distance and on the way to let's set it
07:34 - let's set it to how much we set in the
07:37 - editor so you can see that we set our
07:39 - sweep to have a width of 150 so that's
07:41 - our radar range
07:43 - so in here put 150 and we use it in here
07:49 - alright so that's it we have our nice
07:51 - ray cast
07:52 - now the recast function as you can see
07:54 - returns a great cast hit 2d and this is
07:59 - a struct which contains the results from
08:01 - our ray cast so in here we can simply
08:04 - test if the array Cassidy the collider
08:06 - is not known if it is not known that it
08:09 - means we hit something so when we hit
08:12 - something let's spawn a pop-up so here
08:15 - using a function from the utilities in
08:17 - order to easily spawn a text pop-up and
08:22 - for the position again we can go into
08:24 - the rake asset and use the point field
08:26 - alright just like that okay so as our
08:29 - radar rotates it should be doing great
08:31 - casts on every frame and if it hits
08:33 - something it should display a pop-up
08:35 - let's see okay here we are in yep you
08:38 - can already see the various problems as
08:39 - the radar rotates around you can see
08:42 - it's correctly hitting
08:43 - the enemies and all the items all right
08:46 - awesome however as you can see we have a
08:48 - slight issue here every single object is
08:51 - being hit multiple times this is because
08:53 - every time we rotate our sweep we're
08:55 - doing another ray cast so if the object
08:57 - is big enough it will be held in
08:59 - multiple rotations so that means that we
09:01 - need to keep track of what objects we
09:03 - hit now there are multiple ways we can
09:05 - solve this problem in this case we're
09:07 - going with the simplest and most obvious
09:09 - one so here in our radar let's go up
09:12 - here and make a list of colliders here
09:21 - we have our list and we are
09:22 - instantiating on awake ok and now in
09:25 - here when we hit something
09:27 - let's first test if the collider list if
09:32 - it does not contain our Collider then we
09:38 - hit this one for the first time we hit
09:42 - it and we add it to the list
09:45 - okay so what's test and let's also make
09:47 - the rotation very slow okay here it is
09:50 - and yep just one pink and just one ping
09:52 - just one just one and just one and just
09:55 - one okay so it looks good but and yep
09:59 - there you go when it goes past another
10:00 - second time it no longer pings anything
10:02 - now the issue is obviously because we
10:04 - are filling up the array but we are
10:06 - never clearing so that means that we
10:08 - need to clear out our list at some point
10:10 - now one way to do it would be to clear
10:12 - everything on a full rotation however
10:14 - that could cause issues with moving
10:16 - objects so depending on how fast your
10:18 - objects are moving this solution might
10:20 - be better or worse in our case let's
10:23 - make sure we clear on a half rotation
10:24 - that should be enough for this case so
10:27 - over here before we rotate let's store
10:29 - the previous rotation position okay we
10:34 - have the previous one and then in here
10:36 - we have the current one so now let's
10:38 - calculate the rotations on a half
10:39 - rotation basis
10:49 - so here we are calculating both the
10:51 - previous and the current we are getting
10:54 - the remainder out of 360 and then
10:56 - reducing it by 180 so now using this we
10:58 - can make a simple if if the previous
11:01 - rotation was negative and the current
11:04 - rotation is not negative then here let's
11:09 - trigger our clear alright that should do
11:15 - it
11:15 - let's test okay here we are in yep one
11:18 - thing one one one okay so far so good
11:21 - now that paying another another now
11:23 - let's see if this one things again and
11:25 - yep there you go he pinged again that
11:27 - one pinged again alright awesome so we
11:29 - have just one ping per object and it
11:31 - works perfectly fine after a full
11:33 - rotation right great now instead of
11:36 - spawning this debug Papa might sexually
11:38 - spawn a nice effect over here in the
11:40 - project files I have this nice prefab it
11:42 - contains a simple sprite and a script to
11:45 - animate it fading here is the radar
11:47 - playing script as you can see it's
11:49 - extremely simple we just have a
11:51 - disappear timer and on update we
11:53 - increase the timer and then we reduce
11:56 - the Alpha and once the disappear timer
11:57 - is past the maximum we similarly destroy
11:59 - the game object and down here we also
12:01 - have a function to set the caller and
12:03 - want to set the timer right so very
12:05 - simple now here in the radar script
12:07 - let's add a serum ice field so we can
12:09 - drag our prefab and now in the editor
12:15 - let's drag our reference here's the
12:17 - script and just drag it okay and now
12:19 - down here when we actually collide an
12:21 - object instead of doing our debug pop up
12:24 - well it's actually just instantiate so
12:27 - we instantiate our radar paint prefab on
12:30 - the position which is the raycast hit
12:32 - point and then we don't want any
12:36 - rotation so simply quaternion dot
12:38 - identity alright so that's pretty much
12:40 - it
12:40 - let's test and here we are in yep as you
12:44 - can see the pings are correctly being
12:45 - spawned right great now in here we have
12:48 - our nice set caller function so let's
12:49 - use that to make the paying some look a
12:51 - bit better so in here we instantiate the
12:53 - radar ping and then we get the component
12:56 - of type radar thing and then here we can
13:02 - call set cone
13:03 - now let's spawn a different color one
13:05 - for the enemies and one for the items so
13:07 - let's identify if we hit an enemy or an
13:10 - item the way we can identify them is by
13:12 - what script they have so over here I
13:14 - have the various health icons and the
13:16 - enemies and as you can see the enemies
13:18 - have this character waypoint handler
13:20 - script and the health items as you can
13:23 - see has an item Hamel so we can use
13:24 - those to identify what we hit so in here
13:27 - we do a rake asset Collider so if game
13:31 - object that gets component of type item
13:34 - handler if it does contain that
13:37 - component then we hit on item and then
13:44 - on the other side we have if we hit the
13:47 - character Waypoint panel if so then we
13:52 - hit an enemy all right so now based on
13:55 - which one we hit we can go in here set
13:58 - color and pass in a new color so for the
14:00 - items let's pass in a green so here the
14:03 - color we have the red green and blue so
14:06 - for the red put 0 green one blue zero
14:08 - alright and now here for the enemy well
14:11 - let's make them in red
14:14 - alright that should do it
14:16 - let's test and if there it is we have
14:18 - our pings with different colors
14:20 - depending on what they hit so in here we
14:21 - have an item there your green pink and
14:23 - here we have our enemies and they have
14:25 - red things right awesome
14:27 - now in here we have one potential issue
14:29 - with our code in here in my level let's
14:32 - say that I want to spawn a wall so we
14:34 - new to the object
14:44 - okay so here it is my wall just with a
14:47 - sprite and a box Collider so let's run
14:51 - the code okay here it is let's see any
14:53 - of there's our issue our recast is
14:55 - hitting the wall as well as everything
14:57 - else now obviously we want the radar to
14:59 - only identify enemies and items and not
15:02 - to identify the wall so let's solve that
15:04 - now in here the solution is actually
15:06 - extremely simple here where we have our
15:09 - recast here it is as you can see we have
15:12 - our fields the origin direction and
15:13 - distance and then really have another
15:16 - field for our layer mask a layer mask is
15:19 - how we identify which layers we want to
15:21 - hit so let's go up here make a field for
15:24 - our layer mask and then down here we
15:30 - simply use it and now let's go into the
15:34 - editor here is our layer mask and as you
15:36 - can see unity already provides a very
15:38 - nice drop down check box and now in here
15:40 - we can identify which layers we want to
15:42 - hit so in our case we want to hit
15:44 - enemies and also our items all right so
15:47 - here's our very nice layer mask so let's
15:50 - test ok here we are and yep there you go
15:52 - it complain nor the wall well still
15:54 - pinging on everything else right awesome
15:57 - if you want to learn more about layers
15:58 - layer masks and bit masks check out this
16:01 - video where I go into detail into how
16:02 - they work all right
16:04 - now let's see one more issue we have
16:06 - over here as you can see we have two
16:07 - items placed right next to each other
16:09 - and on the radar when rotates as you can
16:12 - see only the very first one triggers a
16:13 - pink so the second one is not detected
16:16 - now the issue here is with our radar
16:18 - code over here we are using a simple ray
16:21 - cast so what this does is it fires a ray
16:23 - cast but not only goes until it hits
16:25 - something as soon as it hits something
16:26 - it stops so that means if we have two
16:29 - things one behind another one as soon as
16:31 - it hits the first one it come only
16:32 - stopped so it never checks the second
16:34 - one so what we need is a continuous ray
16:36 - cast to test all the objects that are
16:38 - hit in the entirety of our ray so for
16:40 - that instead of the raycast we can use
16:42 - the ray cast on this one as you can see
16:44 - it returns an array every cast hit 2d so
16:47 - to convert our script it's very simple
16:48 - instead of having just one we have
16:50 - Andray and then all we need to do is
16:56 - cycle through the array and inside we do
17:02 - exactly what we were doing previously
17:03 - all right so that's pretty much it
17:05 - now it's test okay here we are let's see
17:08 - these two any of there you go both of
17:10 - them trigger a pink
17:11 - so now objects are no longer hidden if
17:13 - they are behind another object right
17:16 - awesome so at this point we have pretty
17:18 - much our phone radar working if we hide
17:20 - our enemies there we go as you can see
17:22 - the radar is currently detecting
17:24 - everything and also hide the items there
17:26 - you go
17:26 - stone showing and hi the background and
17:29 - there you go we have a very nice radar
17:31 - effect as you can see it's rotating
17:33 - constantly and always doing a recast in
17:36 - order to identify where each object is
17:38 - right awesome so with the radar working
17:41 - let's do one cool thing which is to
17:43 - change our sweep speed so here on the
17:45 - radar we already have our rotation speed
17:48 - and now over here on update let's do a
17:51 - very simple input so we do a get down
17:54 - let's do some button okay so if we hit T
17:58 - let's increase the radar speed and then
18:05 - next to it lets us for an input on the r
18:07 - and let's decrease
18:14 - alright there it is let's see okay so
18:17 - here we are with a normal rotation speed
18:19 - it is currently set to 180 now I press T
18:22 - and there you go it's going slightly
18:24 - faster press a bunch times more and
18:26 - there you go it is now much much faster
18:28 - so there you go now it's at 480 and yep
18:32 - there you go very very fast and now we
18:35 - can hide everything any up just like
18:37 - that as you can see now we have our
18:38 - radar correctly showing where everything
18:41 - is there you go there's an enemy in
18:42 - there and now he's moving in there and
18:44 - there and there
18:45 - we can make it faster faster faster and
18:47 - there you go all right so this is our
18:49 - radar now if you remember we also have a
18:51 - function to set the disappear timer only
18:53 - things and right now if it's going too
18:55 - fast as you can see we can see multiple
18:57 - pings visible at the same time so you
18:59 - can also make the pings be related to
19:01 - the radar speed let's do that so we have
19:05 - the rotation speed and then in here we
19:07 - can go into the radar ping and we call
19:11 - set disappear timer so for example we
19:14 - can make sure that it always disappears
19:16 - before it rotates over again so for
19:19 - rotation is 360 degrees and here we want
19:22 - the time in seconds so here we can set
19:25 - the disappeared timer to be 360 degrees
19:27 - divided by our rotation speed that way
19:30 - as it finishes a rotation it will show
19:32 - again let's see and here we are and as
19:37 - you can see each pane stays pretty much
19:39 - exactly the same amount of time until it
19:41 - finally goes back so as we increase
19:44 - you'll be able to see that it maintains
19:46 - the exact same thing so at 500 there you
19:49 - go now the pings are much much
19:51 - short-lived and yep there you go they're
19:54 - showing all right
19:55 - alternatively we can also make them pre
19:57 - slow so we have multiple at the same
19:58 - time so in here let's see this and if
20:01 - there's our radar effect working and now
20:03 - the pings are essentially living for two
20:05 - rotations so we can almost see a trail
20:07 - of where the enemy has been so you can
20:09 - see this one moving now he's stopping in
20:11 - there now he moved there there
20:13 - there any up there you go and all the
20:14 - items are completely static right
20:16 - awesome so now that we have all this
20:18 - working let's have some fun and make the
20:20 - radar as a mini-map so I'm going to do
20:22 - pretty much the same thing I did in the
20:24 - mini-map video so check the link in the
20:26 - description and go watch that video to
20:27 - see a step-by-step on how to create the
20:29 - mini-map and render your scene onto it
21:17 - okay so here is our nice effect as you
21:20 - can see I have a player here and I can
21:22 - move them around and here in the UI you
21:24 - can see the radar so the radar is no
21:26 - longer visible on here and now let's
21:28 - hide the items so only the enemies are
21:30 - visible and as you can see I have an
21:31 - enemy right next to me if there is and
21:33 - now I got one right below me and yep
21:36 - there it is and now there's an item in
21:37 - here and it's invisible so I can't see
21:39 - it so I can use the map and yep there
21:42 - you go and I've touched it and I've
21:44 - captured the atom now there's another
21:46 - one in here and I can use the radar to
21:48 - find them and yep cut that one and that
21:50 - one and there you go alright so here is
21:52 - our very nice radar effect being a boy
21:54 - to a UI object so again if you want to
21:57 - know how this works you can check out
21:58 - the minimum video where I go through it
22:00 - in detail but in here you can simply see
22:03 - that I have on a UI here an object it's
22:07 - very simple it just has a mask behind it
22:09 - it has a raw image and the raw image is
22:12 - using a render texture right here and
22:14 - then in here I have the main camera and
22:16 - using layers the main camera is not
22:19 - rendering the radar layer only
22:20 - everything else so here in the preview
22:22 - you can see that it doesn't show the
22:23 - radar objects and then I have a second
22:26 - radar camera and this one as you can see
22:28 - is only rendering the radar and it's
22:31 - rendering onto a target texture and then
22:33 - I simply have the radar attached to the
22:35 - player so as the player moves the radar
22:36 - goes with them so again here it is I'm
22:38 - moving my player and I can use the radar
22:40 - to locate the hidden items in any of
22:43 - their you are from the atom and there
22:44 - are a bunch of enemies that show up in
22:46 - the radar as well so over here we have
22:48 - our very nice effect as you can see this
22:51 - is a great effect if you have some sort
22:53 - of cloak enemies in your game or just
22:55 - some hidden easter egg items as always
22:57 - you can download the project company
22:59 - tony's from unity code Montcalm if you
