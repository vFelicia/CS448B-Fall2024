00:00 - however we can look at the number of
00:01 - reviews to get a sales estimate using
00:04 - the box lighter method which means you
00:06 - multiply the review amount by a number
00:07 - between 20 and 70 depending on how
00:10 - optimistic or pessimistic you want to be
00:12 - so let's say we multiply by 40.
00:14 - currently the game has 25 reviews so
00:16 - that times 40 means an estimated
00:18 - thousand copies sold at a price point of
00:21 - 25 that means around 25 000 gross
00:24 - revenue
00:25 - that's not such a tiny number but that's
00:28 - gross revenue so it is not what the
00:29 - developer gets at all from that gross
00:32 - revenue then we have to take away
00:33 - refunds and chargebacks like i mentioned
00:36 - in the other video one excellent
00:37 - newsletter is game discover co and they
00:39 - actually did a case study on refunds
00:42 - they found that the rate for refunds is
00:44 - around six to eleven percent
00:46 - and chargebacks are also around one to
00:48 - two percent so for both of these let's
00:50 - assume ten percent meaning that the
00:52 - initial 25k gross revenue is now just
00:55 - 22.5 k
00:57 - then we have to take away steams cut so
00:59 - that leaves 15.75 after that we take
01:02 - taxes which is going to obviously vary
01:04 - greatly depending on the specifics of
01:06 - the developer maybe on a low tax country
01:08 - that could be something around 10 to 20
01:10 - percent and maybe in a high tax country
01:12 - maybe around 40 to 50 percent so let's
01:15 - take a number in the middle let's say 30
01:17 - percent with that we calculate that the
01:19 - final total net revenue going into the
01:21 - developer's pocket is around 11k
01:24 - that is much less than the initial 25k
01:26 - which by itself was already pretty small
01:28 - and of course this is revenue it's not
01:29 - profit everyone has costs the developers
01:32 - have to eat so it's doubtful based on
01:33 - this number that this game turned a
01:35 - profit so with this tiny amount we can
01:37 - definitely say that the game suddenly
01:38 - failed to find success despite looking
01:40 - like a high quality good game
01:42 - now let's try to identify why that
01:44 - happened and what they could have done
01:46 - differently
