00:00 - Hello and Welcome I'm your Code Monkey
00:02 - The Asset Store is full of awesome tools and has to help you make your own games 
00:05 - there's more and more 
awesome stuff coming out every month so in this  
00:08 - video let's check out some highlights for December 
22.
00:10 - In this first video I'll be covering a list of free assets
00:12 - and the next ones I'll be covering 
paid assets and tools
00:15 - Let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to 
do with them
00:18 - Also here's some excellent news the two best bundles that I've ever seen that happened 
a couple of months ago they are back for the holidays
00:25 - There is an excellent tools bundle with 
all kinds of systems and tools
00:28 - So you've got an engine for making a top-down shooter a tool for setting up some light probes
00:32 - You can set up some weather effects set up some 2D lights a better 
UI and some really awesome fluid animations
00:38 - So lots of excellent tools on this one
00:40 - And then here is the excellent art bundle 
with tons of visuals and some interesting shaders
00:44 - This one has quite a lot of variety quite a lot of things
00:47 - for example here you have Quibli, this is an excellent cartoony 
Shader
00:51 - Then a really nice Synty pack a whole bunch of music tons and tons of sound effects
00:56 - You've got some more Shader effects so to pixelize them which looks really interesting
01:00 - You've got some fantasy nature a realistic template
01:03 - A bunch of cute animals tons more animations a bunch of 
effects and a bunch more
01:07 - So if you've missed these two bundles when they first happened a few 
months ago then I highly highly recommend you give them a look
01:13 - with the insane 98% OFF discount the 
entire bundle is worth it just for a single tool or acid
01:18 - And of course the Synty Sale is also still happening 
So you feel like their pack included in that bundle you can check out the sale and see everything they do   
01:25 - Alright so on to the Top 10 list starting off with a simple but 
possibly very useful tool here is editor autosave  
01:31 - It does exactly what you expect you can define 
a safe time and every once in a while the editor  
01:36 - automatically saves It also says it has scene 
Version Control which is an interesting idea  
01:41 - being able to go back to an earlier version 
can be useful you can limit how many scenes  
01:45 - are saved you can do a backup and enable or 
disable it with a simple click now for me I  
01:50 - pretty much subconsciously hit Ctrl s pretty much 
every few seconds so I don't really need this  
01:55 - but if you don't have that habit then this can 
help you avoid losing a bunch of data next up  
02:00 - some great looking props here are some wooden 
swords I quite unlike the visual on these ones  
02:04 - looks really nice you have a sword dagger Katana 
big sword Roman sword and medieval so these would  
02:10 - be perfect for any kind of sword game where you 
have some kind of training scenario or tutorial  
02:14 - up next here is an interesting weird effect it 
looks very strange very interesting I could see  
02:20 - this as being a fun effect to add to something 
like in loading screen if you have some kind of  
02:24 - sci-fi game then if you're making a game with some 
roads check out these props you have a bunch of  
02:30 - signs some traffic cones a bunch of concrete walls 
and even some speed bumps after that if you'd like  
02:35 - a quick character to add to your prototype check 
out this cute penguin it comes with 5 Sprite based  
02:40 - animations you have I don't walk attack jump and 
slide so this looks like pretty fun if you're  
02:45 - working on some kind of side stronger game then 
for another interesting tool here is auto level  
02:51 - it's a procedural level generator it comes with 
some editor tools so you can build it directly  
02:56 - inside the editor you can rebuild certain sections 
to find some connection points and a bunch more  
03:01 - next up here is a nice pixel art pack features 
quite a lot of objects lots of variety although  
03:07 - no animation so again this would be great if 
you're making a quick prototype then for another  
03:11 - interesting fun tool here is Rainbow playmo Tint 
it does exactly what you expect it changes the  
03:16 - color while in play mode with a nice rainbow color 
if you're the kind of person who regularly forgets  
03:21 - that you're in play mode or not then this can 
be a bit more visible than just using a solid  
03:25 - color next up if you're making a 2d side Roller 
One easy way you can make your game look much  
03:30 - better is just by adding some nice parallax here 
is a bunch of separate backgrounds to help you do  
03:35 - just that it's a simple effect but really helps 
push your game to the next level and if you want  
03:40 - to know how to do it I actually covered it in 
a video quite a long time ago and then if all  
03:44 - you want is just a nice simple and Forest more 
texture here's one it's seamless so it turns well  
03:48 - and has some nice variety Alright so those are
