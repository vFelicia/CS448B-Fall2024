00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this course you will learn how to
00:03 - make complete games from start to finish
00:05 - all
00:06 - using unity visual scripting without
00:07 - writing a single line of code
00:10 - in this course you're going to build not
00:11 - one but three games a platformer a
00:13 - action rpg game and an awesome first
00:15 - person shooter
00:16 - by bundling several games you will learn
00:18 - how visual scripting works and how you
00:20 - can apply it to any game
00:22 - about me i'm a professional indie game
00:24 - developer with several successful games
00:26 - published on steam covering a wide range
00:28 - of genres
00:29 - i've been programming for over 20 years
00:30 - and using unity for almost 10
00:32 - also a couple of years ago i started a
00:34 - youtube channel making free tutorial
00:36 - videos to share my knowledge to help you
00:37 - learn how to make your own games
00:39 - so if you'd like to try out my learning
00:41 - style before purchasing the course you
00:43 - can watch the over 300 videos available
00:45 - for free on the youtube channel
00:47 - they are presented as clear step-by-step
00:49 - tutorials just like this course
00:51 - so a bit more about the games in this
00:53 - course you're going to build not one but
00:54 - three complete games
00:56 - by building various genres you will
00:58 - better learn how to use visual scripting
00:59 - in any scenario
01:00 - first we start off with the platformer
01:02 - game this is the simplest one and works
01:04 - as a great introduction to visual
01:06 - scripting
01:07 - starting off just by learning how to
01:09 - handle movement physics collisions
01:10 - jumping and so on
01:12 - then as you'll learn the basics we start
01:14 - adding more features
01:15 - and the final game is a simple but very
01:17 - nice platformer
01:18 - so there's moving platforms there's
01:20 - multiple levels hazards coins lava and
01:22 - so on
01:23 - the second game is the action rpg this
01:26 - one is a very complete game with tons of
01:28 - features
01:28 - it's got multiple weapons multiple
01:30 - enemies and hazards there's coins and
01:32 - pickups dungeons with portals cannons
01:34 - and lava
01:35 - so the final game is really feature rich
01:37 - once again all of this built without
01:39 - writing a single
01:40 - line of code this one is more complex
01:42 - thanks to building on top of the
01:43 - knowledge gained while making the
01:44 - platform again
01:45 - and the third game is a first person
01:47 - shooter which takes all the knowledge
01:49 - gained in the previous two games and
01:50 - applies it to 3d
01:52 - it features multiple weapons enemies
01:53 - pickups coins a boss fight and an
01:55 - awesome hookshot mechanic
01:57 - all three games are included in the
01:58 - course from start to finish and they are
02:00 - set up to provide a nice smooth learning
02:02 - curve
02:02 - so first you'll learn the absolute
02:04 - basics in the platformer and then
02:05 - continue learning and apply that face
02:07 - knowledge to the action rpg and then to
02:09 - the fps
02:10 - so by the end you will have three
02:12 - complete games as well as the knowledge
02:13 - to then be able to go ahead and use
02:15 - visual scripting to make
02:16 - any game in any genre you can think of
02:19 - visual scripting also works as an
02:20 - excellent tool for learning
02:22 - programming even if you've never written
02:24 - any code by the end of this course you
02:25 - will have learned how logic works and
02:27 - how objects and scripts interact with
02:29 - another with that knowledge if you want
02:31 - you can then go ahead and easily learn
02:33 - programming or stick with visual
02:34 - scripting
02:35 - so this is a great course both for
02:37 - absolute beginners who want to start
02:38 - commonly from scratch
02:39 - and also great for more advanced users
02:41 - who want to see more advanced use cases
02:43 - for visual scripting
02:44 - or just want to see how to design and
02:46 - implement some interesting mechanics
02:48 - this complete course is presented as a
02:50 - thorough step-by-step guide where i will
02:51 - show you exactly how to do what i'm
02:53 - doing
02:53 - and why it is that i'm doing it so you
02:55 - can learn how to think like a
02:56 - professional indie game developer
02:58 - every single lecture also includes the
03:00 - complete project files so you can
03:01 - download them and follow along
03:03 - exactly as i'm doing if you feel lost or

03:10 - you may have
03:11 - alright so go ahead join me on this
03:13 - course and let's learn how to master
03:14 - visual scripting and build some awesome
03:16 - games together
