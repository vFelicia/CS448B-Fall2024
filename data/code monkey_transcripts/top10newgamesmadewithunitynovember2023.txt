00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your kmy and here
00:02 - let's check out the top new games made
00:03 - with Y launch in November 23 honestly
00:06 - I'm feeling a bit of deja vu I feel like
00:08 - I'm about to repeat the exact same thing
00:09 - that I've said in the past two months
00:11 - this month was once again one of the
00:12 - toughest months ever very tough to pick
00:14 - just 10 games the amount of really
00:16 - awesome looking games that are coming
00:17 - out every month seems to be increasing
00:19 - that's really awesome for players tons
00:20 - of awesome stuff to play and of course
00:22 - also a bit tough heavy competition for
00:24 - developer the reason why I make these
00:25 - videos is to show you everything the
00:27 - engine can do the only limit is really
00:28 - just your own skills and Imagination and
00:30 - the variety and the awesomeness of the
00:31 - games shown here really puts that to the
00:33 - test all of these games are impressive
00:35 - so they list in no particular order
00:36 - except for the number one game that is
00:38 - my personal pick of the month and if you
00:39 - haven't seen the Humble Bundle with tons
00:41 - of tools and definitely check it out for
00:43 - just 35 bucks you can get tons of tools
00:45 - that do all kinds of things you've got
00:46 - some visual some things for animating
00:48 - some things for 2D soft body cars
00:50 - handling feedback forms slicing things
00:52 - and even completing templates or if all
00:54 - you want are just some visuals and the
00:55 - Cindy store has just started their
00:56 - holiday season sale all with tons of
00:58 - assets in their gorgeous Sal they even
01:00 - have a fun holiday gift basket or
01:02 - alternatively the unity accur is also
01:04 - having their new year sale I haven't yet
01:06 - had the time to look at this one but I'm
01:07 - sure tons of awesome stuff are currently
01:08 - on say so if you need anything check out
01:10 - all the links in the description all
01:12 - right so starting off at number 10 with
01:14 - a sequel to an extremely successful game
01:16 - it's for the King 2 I've heard great
01:18 - things about the original this one was a
01:20 - huge hit the sequel this one is a
01:22 - strategy RPG that blends table top and
01:24 - broke likee elements it features
01:26 - multiple unique Adventures across a
01:27 - varied world all of them linked through
01:29 - a narrative you can create your party
01:31 - from 12 unique character classes engage
01:34 - in turn-based combat in a grid where
01:36 - positioning is key but at the same time
01:37 - remember that this is a rogalik so
01:39 - failure is definitely a part of the
01:41 - process if you fail you will start
01:42 - stronger and wiser on your next campaign
01:44 - so you can go further and further you
01:46 - can play either Solo or online and
01:48 - despite being a full release they seem
01:50 - to have a pre- robust 2-year road map so
01:52 - far the game has a barely mostly
01:54 - positive score it seems there are some
01:56 - bugs and balancing issues although
01:58 - despite that that did not stop the game
01:59 - from being a huge hit it already has a
02:01 - huge amount of reviews over 7,000 next
02:03 - if you're into some compelling stories
02:05 - with excellent 2D art then check out
02:07 - back to the dawn this one is a story
02:09 - Rich detective style RPG with an intense
02:11 - prison escape Journey right away the
02:13 - style is absolutely excellent personally
02:15 - for me I'm usually much more into
02:17 - gameplay than visuals but I just can't
02:18 - help but be impressed with how good this
02:20 - looks it's got some excellent 2D art
02:22 - with some great Lighting in 3D effects
02:24 - the game itself is an interesting
02:25 - Adventure game where you play as a fox
02:27 - who was apparently framed and put in
02:29 - prison now you have to learn how to
02:30 - survive and break out it features tons
02:32 - of interesting mini games for all kinds
02:34 - of actions things like soaring packages
02:36 - lifting weights pickpocketing or just
02:38 - play on combat you can meet and talk
02:39 - with interesting unique characters you
02:41 - can hatch a plan and finally break free
02:43 - this one has apparently been under
02:44 - development alongside an active
02:46 - Community already for over four years
02:48 - and it's finally out now on seam it's in
02:50 - Early Access which is usually odd for
02:52 - these kinds of story heavy games but
02:54 - people do seem to be loving it already
02:55 - has over 2,000 very positive reviews
02:58 - then for something very much focused on
02:59 - mechanics here is backpack hero this one
03:02 - is an inventory management brok like
03:04 - your inventory has a certain size and
03:06 - items have different shapes you need to
03:07 - organize and fit them all together but
03:09 - do it carefully position of the objects
03:11 - is hugely important it is not just for
03:13 - compactness objects have significant
03:15 - bonuses if they are nearby other related
03:17 - objects there are tons and tons of items
03:19 - with tons of unique combinations for you
03:20 - to discover you can engage in battles
03:22 - but also take some time off in between
03:24 - in order to rebuild a nice Village and
03:26 - unlock more items that you can then use
03:28 - on your journey one really interesting
03:30 - tutorial that I did quite a while ago
03:31 - was my Tetris inventory system tutorial
03:34 - I've always wanted to use that one in a
03:35 - more complex project and this game
03:37 - definitely shows the potential for some
03:38 - interesting use case for a system like
03:40 - that one it is now fully released after
03:41 - spending one year in Early Access
03:43 - throughout that time it has gathered
03:44 - almost 5,000 very positive reviews so
03:47 - this one looks really interesting
03:48 - definitely give it a try next if you're
03:50 - into Old School arcade car games check
03:52 - out super wooden gp2 just one glance at
03:55 - this one and it immediately makes it
03:56 - clear how it perally captures all of
03:58 - those old arcade racers the camera
04:00 - position the CRT effects the really nice
04:02 - smoke and some arcade car handling all
04:04 - of them really perfectly done it
04:06 - features a huge amount of vehicles
04:08 - almost 200 of them and they are all of
04:10 - all kinds of unique types you've got
04:12 - everything from supercars to rally cars
04:14 - to some really old classics you can buy
04:16 - cars you can put them in your garage and
04:18 - upgrade them then pick from tons of
04:20 - interesting events with some really
04:21 - awesome tracks and race of the Finish
04:22 - Line it features local multiplayer which
04:24 - is really awesome for a game like this
04:25 - one and also has some online
04:27 - leaderboards this is one of those games
04:29 - were for a particular type of person
04:30 - this will be absolutely perfect then
04:32 - here's yet another huge hit that is also
04:34 - a sequel and that also just got our
04:36 - Early Access it's my time at Sandrock
04:38 - the previous one my time of Porsche is a
04:41 - game that apparently everyone really
04:42 - loved and while sometimes in the
04:44 - sequence can fall flat thankfully the
04:45 - feedback seems to be this one is
04:47 - definitely a great sequel this is a
04:48 - building crafting sandbox farming game
04:50 - it's very Charming you can explore this
04:52 - world embark on an exciting Adventure
04:54 - build out your Village from scratch farm
04:56 - for resources and for money so there's
04:58 - tons and tons of activities for you to
04:59 - do the best thing about these games
05:01 - seems to be how they are a great mix
05:03 - between sandbox building and also a nice
05:05 - narrative and after all that time in
05:06 - Early Access the game already has a huge
05:08 - amount of content features hundreds and
05:10 - hundreds of hours of content doing
05:12 - things like quests crafting building
05:14 - relationships you can do farming fishing
05:16 - combat Dungeons and tons more if you
05:18 - haven't played the first one maybe pick
05:20 - that one up since it's regularly pretty
05:21 - cheap nowadays and if you do enjoy that
05:23 - one you will definitely also enjoy this
05:25 - one it is out now and already has
05:27 - 177,000 very positive reviews next if
05:29 - you've always wanted to be a blacksmith
05:31 - check out this management Adventure game
05:32 - called envil Saga you take control of a
05:35 - blacksmith shop amid an intense War
05:37 - build out the Smitty of your dreams open
05:39 - up new rooms both above ground and

05:43 - the right equipment to improve the
05:44 - quality of your items you can hire a
05:46 - team of professionals to help you out by
05:47 - doing various tasks then of course you
05:49 - are a blacksmith so the customers come
05:51 - in and what they want is very important
05:53 - every decision you make impacts both the
05:55 - gameplay as well as the story so will he
05:57 - try to be honest or will he actually try
05:59 - to scam someone with some fake jewelry
06:01 - the choice is yours but so are the
06:02 - consequences as you make better and
06:04 - better items you can increase your
06:05 - Renown if you're good enough you might
06:07 - be asked to make one of a kind weapon
06:08 - it's a really interesting game mixing
06:10 - both mechanics and a heavy story this
06:12 - one has been development for quite some
06:14 - time it already had several demos then
06:16 - Early Access and now finally a full
06:18 - release it's currently got a thousand
06:20 - mostly positive reviews then if you've
06:21 - ever wanted to grow and manage a red
06:23 - Colony then check out ropia this is a
06:26 - survival sandbox Colony building
06:28 - simulation star we just one rat and
06:30 - begin Gathering resources start digging
06:32 - down into the side build the door and
06:34 - invite more rzants to join you on your
06:35 - Colony you directly control one rat and
06:38 - then give orders to all the rest this
06:39 - one certainly has a certain charm and
06:41 - uniqueness with everything being rat
06:43 - based you not only give them orders but
06:44 - you can also set policies like how long
06:46 - do they need to work and what taxes do
06:48 - they pay but at the same time they also
06:50 - have a mind of their own meaning you can
06:52 - either create or prevent social
06:54 - disasters with all your policies the
06:55 - world is huge and it's all open for you
06:57 - to explore but of course beware you are
06:59 - are not alone in this world making these
07:01 - kinds of Skys scrolling Colony Builders
07:03 - this is a really tricky genre but this
07:05 - one seems to be great it is out now in
07:06 - Early Access and already has 1500 very
07:09 - positive reviews next if you're into
07:10 - stylish action Platformers check out
07:12 - saabi this is another one with some
07:14 - really gorgeous pixel art it's a very
07:16 - fluid platformer features some really
07:18 - fluid action you have all kinds of
07:20 - attacks air dashes and slices you've got
07:22 - a hook shot to make traversing dangerous
07:24 - paths really fun you can fight all kinds
07:26 - of interesting enemies and explore this
07:27 - awesome dystopian World there tons of
07:29 - explosions all over the place the game
07:31 - has a serious emphasis on verticality in
07:33 - trailer the character is rarely touching
07:35 - the floor so it's a really active game
07:37 - Platformers is usually a genre that I
07:39 - really don't recommend people to make
07:40 - simply because there are already so many
07:42 - that it's so difficult to stand out but
07:44 - of course the top .1% that do find
07:46 - success do become massive hits this one
07:47 - is out now with already over 10,000
07:49 - overwhelmingly positive views that's an
07:51 - insanely good result then if you're in
07:53 - the mood to play a classic check out
07:54 - stronghold Definitive Edition this one
07:57 - is a remake of a very old game
07:58 - personally I I've heard great things
08:00 - about it but never actually played it
08:01 - back then I was more into Age of Empires
08:03 - and Empire Earth so I never tried this
08:05 - one this is apparently a very faithful
08:06 - remake with some improved visuals
08:08 - modernized gameplay it's got a new
08:10 - campaign and seam multiplayer like new
08:12 - implies you built a stronghold set up
08:14 - farming to gather some food mindful
08:16 - resources and use them to recruit
08:17 - military units then build up some high
08:19 - walls and R yourself because an attack
08:21 - is imminent they will attack with
08:22 - soldiers Cavalry and some deadly
08:24 - trebuchet it's up to you to protect the
08:26 - villagers and grow a thriving stronghold
08:28 - this one was originally released in 2001
08:30 - which is now over 20 years old but this
08:32 - classic gameplay never really goes out
08:33 - of style it is out now and people seem
08:35 - to be really enjoying this remake with
08:37 - over 5,000 very positive reviews then at
08:39 - number one for my personal pick of the
08:41 - month here is gym simulator 24 this very
08:43 - much a personal pick for a long time
08:45 - I've always wanted to make some kind of
08:47 - gym Simulator game but I always decided
08:49 - against it because I figured it would be
08:50 - way too Nish and not really something
08:52 - the seam audience is interesting but
08:54 - looking at how much success this one is
08:55 - fighting it seems that I was definitely
08:57 - wrong about that like name implies you
08:58 - build and run your gym this is one of
09:00 - those Similator games where you start
09:02 - from scratch you buy a rundown building
09:04 - start tearing down walls and building
09:06 - your gym you can buy all kinds of
09:07 - equipment and place it down anywhere buy
09:09 - some machines some free weights some
09:11 - barbells and cardio machines then go out
09:13 - into the supermarket and buy some
09:14 - supplements to stock up your vending
09:16 - machine set up some lights paint the
09:17 - walls clean the floors and open up as
09:19 - your guests work out they are going to
09:21 - get stinky and for some reason it's up
09:23 - to you to spray them down I really don't
09:25 - think this part is a realistic part of
09:27 - the simulation then you can also make
09:29 - what looks like an unlicensed boxing
09:31 - ring and take some bets so it definitely
09:32 - has quite a lot of actions quite a lot
09:34 - of variety honestly another thing that
09:35 - I've long wanted to make is one of these
09:37 - type of firstperson similar games it's
09:39 - one of the topics that I'd like to cover
09:41 - in a full course someday and looking at
09:43 - this one really makes me want to do it
09:44 - the simulator games are usually quite
09:46 - janky and the trailer does look that way
09:48 - but apparently that isn't stopping
09:49 - people from enjoying it corly it's got
09:51 - 600 very positive reviews all right so
09:53 - that's 10 awesome new games made with
09:55 - unity launch in November 23 I hope this
09:57 - list helped you see how the unity is
09:59 - capable of building anything your limits
10:01 - are really just your own skills and
10:02 - Imagination check out my own game thany
10:04 - Gardens and I hope you enjoy playing it
