00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made with unity for march 2021.
00:06 - my goal with these videos is to
00:07 - highlight what can be done with the
00:09 - engine so you know the oil limit is
00:10 - really just your own imagination
00:12 - all these games are uniquely impressive
00:13 - and showcase the power of the engine in
00:15 - tons of different scenarios so the list
00:16 - is in no particular order
00:18 - except for the number one game that is
00:20 - my personal pick of the month
00:21 - there's also links in the description
00:22 - for each game those are affiliate links
00:24 - so if you use them it's the same price
00:25 - you and i'll also be supporting the
00:27 - channel
00:27 - alright so let's go starting off at
00:29 - number 10. here is team fight manager
00:32 - it's a simulation game where you are the
00:34 - coach of an esports team it's an
00:35 - interesting concept
00:37 - you manage the team you must manage the
00:39 - players and set them up for matches
00:41 - make the best choices with pick and ban
00:43 - by evaluating the champions and players
00:45 - it's a strategy game in that a smart
00:47 - strategy can make up for a lack of
00:49 - skills
00:50 - watch as the battle unfolds and hope
00:51 - that your players are good enough to win
00:53 - train your players grow your team
00:55 - improve their equipment and lead your
00:56 - team to become the best
00:58 - and win the world championship it's a
01:00 - very interesting concept and based on
01:01 - the number of very positive reviews it
01:03 - seems very well executed
01:05 - they also have an interesting model
01:07 - where they are selling dlcs that don't
01:09 - have any
01:09 - in-game content but instead are meant to
01:12 - work kind of like patreon where you can
01:13 - support the developers
01:15 - so it's an interesting approach
01:16 - essentially to go with a very small
01:18 - price for the base game
01:19 - and pretty much just hope that some
01:21 - people are generous enough to want to
01:22 - support the team
01:23 - it's an interesting model so i wonder if
01:25 - this strategy won't be successful
01:27 - next up here's one that caught my eye as
01:29 - soon as i saw it
01:30 - circuit superstars i really can't quite
01:32 - tell why i love the look of this one so
01:34 - much but i think it just looks great
01:36 - the colors feel very inviting with the
01:38 - whole game having this nice cartooning
01:39 - look
01:40 - it's a top-down racing game on seven
01:43 - unique racing circuits
01:44 - the main focus is on making the driving
01:46 - feel great it's been development for
01:48 - five years and the handling model is
01:50 - their pride and joy
01:51 - race with tons of unique vehicles across
01:53 - various motorsports including rallycross

03:23 - depending on where you are so you can
03:25 - grab something huge push it far away and
03:27 - make it tiny

04:07 - any of these vr games with tons of
04:09 - automatic movement

04:47 - equipment to help you survive against
04:49 - enemies
04:50 - but if they're too strong then running
04:51 - away might just be the better option
04:53 - i think this is the first base building
04:55 - game that i've seen with the steampunk
04:57 - theme
04:57 - so that's certainly unique it just came

05:52 - the life and suffering of sir branti

06:20 - i have no idea what the name means but
06:21 - it's a relaxing building strategy puzzle
06:23 - game
06:24 - it's one of those games with a simple
06:26 - concept executed perfectly with tons of
06:27 - polish
06:28 - you get tiles and place them on a hex
06:30 - grid different tiles have different
06:31 - things so
06:32 - some have houses others have a windmill
06:34 - some have quests and so on
06:36 - you continue expanding the world as the
06:38 - seasons change
06:39 - it certainly looks very unique and
06:41 - interestingly in the store page they
06:43 - make an effort to point out which
06:44 - features the game does not have
06:46 - so it does not have any forex strategy
06:49 - trading
06:49 - any resource management there is no
06:51 - combat or violence or
06:53 - any multiplayer it is very intentionally
06:56 - a company relaxing city builder
06:58 - very interesting concept so i might pick
06:59 - it up just to see if it really is that
07:01 - relaxing
07:02 - then at number one for my personal pick
07:04 - of the month here is endzone over on the
07:06 - part
07:06 - it just had its full release coming out
07:08 - of early access after one year of
07:10 - constant updates
07:11 - it's a very interesting city builder
07:12 - where you essentially rebuild after the
07:14 - nuclear apocalypse
07:16 - so that means you have to deal with
07:17 - radiation drought sandstorms and so on
07:20 - you need to build up your colony by
07:21 - giving your people homes to live in
07:23 - set up some supply chains together food
07:25 - and water and of course make sure
07:26 - nothing is contaminated
07:28 - the game features an endless survival
07:30 - mode but also some really unique very
07:31 - interesting scenarios
07:32 - for example in one of them your goal is
07:34 - to find all the seeds in the world
07:36 - another one you start with a completely
07:37 - broken settlement and need to rebuild it
07:39 - and so on
07:40 - if you're into city builders this is a
07:42 - very good one i've definitely enjoyed my
07:43 - time
07:44 - with it and i also made my very first
07:46 - how it's made video where i
07:48 - remake a specific system or mechanic
07:50 - from a game
07:51 - in that one i remade the soil moisture
07:53 - radiation system
07:54 - it's a really cool system and despite
07:56 - looking very complex it's actually quite
07:57 - simple
07:58 - so you could definitely add it to your
08:00 - own games with relative ease
08:01 - that video is a new format i'm trying
08:03 - out so if you haven't seen it yet go
