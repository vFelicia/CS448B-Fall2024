00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your kmy so when
00:02 - learning pretty much anything there's
00:03 - something called tutorial hell this
00:05 - basically where people just watch
00:06 - tutorials non-stop they might watch a
00:08 - 100 videos teaching them all kinds of
00:10 - things but then when they stop watching
00:12 - and they try doing something at that
00:14 - point they get Frozen and are unable to
00:15 - build pretty much anything from scratch
00:17 - so despite watching hours and hours of
00:19 - really high quality tutorial content
00:21 - despite that those people feel like they
00:23 - haven't really learned anything so if
00:25 - this is you if you feel like you're
00:26 - watching tons of tutorials and not
00:28 - really learning anything if so then my
00:30 - best advice to you is to stop blindly
00:31 - watching tutorials and go actually do
00:33 - something specifically I think the issue
00:35 - is that some people think that watching
00:36 - just the tutorials is the only step on
00:38 - your Learning Journey some people think
00:39 - that just watching video tutorials is
00:41 - enough that if you watch enough hours of
00:43 - tutorials if you do that you won't gain
00:44 - enough knowledge however in reality
00:46 - watching these video tutorials this is
00:48 - really just one step it is the first and
00:50 - actually the smallest step now don't get
00:52 - me wrong tutorials are excellent I've
00:54 - made tons and tons of tutorials myself
00:55 - and I truly believe they are helpful in
00:57 - teaching you how to build all kinds of
00:58 - things that's really why I make all
01:00 - these videos however I want you to know
01:02 - that you don't learn just by watching
01:04 - you need to put what you learn into
01:06 - practice in order to actually solidify
01:07 - that knowledge so you need to open up
01:09 - some project and start writing some code
01:11 - modify it in various ways to see exactly
01:12 - what happens and specifically in terms
01:14 - of programming the more code you write
01:15 - the more you TR to learn so yes do watch
01:17 - tutorials but stop blly watching
01:19 - tutorials meaning don't just watch
01:21 - something in order to just take some box
01:23 - or tell people you saw some video the
01:25 - goal is watch a tutorial in order to
01:26 - learn and then take some action to
01:28 - actively apply that knowledge for for
01:29 - example if you want to learn how an
01:31 - interaction system works for that you
01:33 - can watch my tutorial on it to learn how
01:34 - it works to learn the theory behind it
01:36 - and how all these systems all the
01:38 - elements connect to one another but then
01:40 - very importantly do not ignore the
01:41 - crucial next step after watching the
01:43 - video then open up a brand new project
01:45 - and write some code to yourself you only
01:46 - truly learn by doing so do not skip this
01:48 - second step my C course that I just
01:50 - released was made exactly with this in
01:52 - mind I want you to truly learn so that
01:54 - is why I designed the frequently asked
01:56 - questions the quizzes and the
01:57 - interactive exercises you are supposed
01:59 - to go through all these after watching
02:00 - each individual video lecture by reading
02:03 - the frequently asked questions by doing
02:04 - that you are a bit more active than just
02:06 - watching and listening to a video Then
02:08 - by doing all these quizzes you are even
02:10 - more active and in order to answer
02:11 - correctly you have to retrieve the
02:13 - knowledge that you gained from the
02:14 - lecture and finally the interactive
02:16 - exercises these require you to actually
02:18 - write some code and actually put into
02:19 - practice what you learn I specifically
02:21 - designed all of these to have an
02:22 - increasing level of participation that
02:24 - is required from you meaning you go from
02:26 - passively watching just the video
02:27 - lectures to actively reading the
02:29 - frequently Asked question questions to
02:30 - actively answering some questions and
02:32 - finally very actively writing some
02:33 - actual real code if you just blindly
02:36 - watch videos you won't really learn much
02:38 - but if you put in the effort to actively
02:40 - learn and actively apply all the
02:41 - knowledge that you're gaining if you do
02:42 - that that's how you truly learn also let
02:44 - me make one quick note here the
02:46 - companion project for my C course that
02:48 - contains all this that is part of the
02:50 - premium version of the course however if
02:52 - you can't afford that's fine you can
02:53 - still learn I've already published the
02:55 - free beginner section here on YouTube
02:56 - and I will publish the free intermediate
02:58 - section next month in the video lectures
02:59 - at the very end I included the titles
03:01 - for the questions quiz and exercise so
03:03 - even when watching the completely free
03:05 - videos over here on YouTube you can
03:06 - still follow exactly what I'm saying
03:07 - here watch every lecture then actively
03:09 - go do all of this you just need to
03:11 - basically guide yourself and put in the
03:13 - effort to find the answers to all these
03:14 - questions and remember to actively write
03:16 - some code yourself if you do that then
03:18 - yep you will earn a great amount and on
03:20 - these two videos completely for free
03:21 - however if you can afford the premium
03:23 - version that's really great because it
03:24 - gives you a simple pre-plan guide path
03:26 - all you have to do is follow my
03:27 - instructions and put in the work and if
03:29 - you do that then I guarantee that by the
03:30 - end you will have gained a ton of C
03:32 - knowledge and also on this topic let me
03:34 - say I'm no different from you for
03:36 - example something recent that I had to
03:37 - learned from Squatch was dots I made a
03:39 - really detailed video tutorial about two
03:41 - months ago and the way that I researched
03:42 - for that topic was very simple first I
03:44 - watched a bunch of video tutorials on
03:46 - that topic then I read a ton of the
03:48 - official documentation and then very
03:50 - very importantly I took the next step of
03:52 - loading up a brand new Unity project and
03:54 - just started writing code so I tried
03:56 - creating a basic entity building a
03:57 - component writing a simple system and so
03:59 - on that is really how you TR learn that
04:01 - is true for you as it is for me if I had
04:03 - just watched videos and just read
04:04 - documentation then I wouldn't have been
04:06 - able to gain the knowledge that I gained
04:08 - which I then Ed to make that video
04:09 - teaching you everything that I learned
04:10 - so really what I'm saying here applies
04:12 - to both beginners and more advanced
04:13 - users regardless of how scill you are at
04:16 - something you still need to actively
04:17 - apply it in order to continue learning
04:19 - and truly learn whatever it is you're
04:20 - trying to learn and somewhat related to
04:22 - this is something that I always tell in
04:23 - the comments in my courses if you're
04:26 - following some kind of long course that
04:27 - is multiple hours if you do that and you
04:29 - don't understand some kind of part my
04:31 - advice is do not blindly keep going
04:33 - forward if you do then you're probably
04:35 - just going to be more and more confused
04:37 - so if there are some course you're
04:38 - following and there are some topics some
04:39 - part of it that you don't understand if
04:41 - so then stick with it stay there until
04:43 - you do understand research that specific
04:45 - topics more open up a project write some
04:47 - code modify some things to see what
04:49 - changes and ask some questions but
04:51 - importantly stick with it and only move
04:53 - forward once you finally fully
04:54 - understand that topic if you want to get
04:56 - the most out of pretty much any course
04:58 - my course or anyone else's courses if
05:00 - you want to truly learn definitely make
05:01 - sure what I'm saying here go through it
05:03 - step by step and don't go on to the next
05:04 - step until you fully understand the
05:06 - previous steps now this topic being
05:08 - stuck in tutorial heal this something
05:09 - that I see in a lot of comments soly now
05:11 - I can send them a link to this video
05:13 - instead of constantly rewriting the same
05:14 - thing every time if you want a guided
05:16 - path to actively learn by doing if so
05:19 - then check out my complete C course Link
05:20 - in the description like I said I
05:22 - specifically designed it to have all
05:24 - these kinds of interactive things to
05:25 - help you truly learn by doing all right
05:27 - so thanks for watching and I'll see you
05:28 - next time
