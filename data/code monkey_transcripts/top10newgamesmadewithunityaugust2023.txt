00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - now before I start this video given
00:04 - everything that is going on I feel the
00:05 - need for a quick disclaimer whatever you
00:07 - think of unity as a company don't take
00:09 - it out on these devs making awesome
00:10 - games whatever the company behind does
00:12 - the tool itself is still excellent when
00:14 - put in the hands of self creators I've
00:16 - been making this series covering the top
00:17 - new games every month and I plan to
00:19 - continue doing it for as long as devs
00:21 - are building awesome things with the
00:22 - engine and here let's check out the top
00:23 - new games made with the UNT launch on
00:25 - August 23. this was another Banker month
00:27 - really tricky to pick just 10 games I
00:29 - guess a lot of Indies wanted to quickly
00:31 - launch in August before star film took
00:33 - up everyone's time in September this
00:35 - month the first game is a really great
00:37 - story of a small Indie Dev finding
00:39 - massive success and then the last game
00:40 - that one is another absolutely excellent
00:42 - game but suddenly also comes with some
00:44 - bad news the reason why I make these
00:46 - videos is to show you everything the
00:47 - engine can do the only limit is really
00:48 - just your own skills and Imagination and
00:50 - the variety and the awesomeness of the
00:52 - game shown here really puts out the test
00:53 - all of these games are unically
00:55 - impressive so the list is in no
00:56 - particular order except for the number
00:57 - one game that is my personal pick of the
00:59 - month also I'm currently working on my
01:00 - own Sim game Thinking Guardians it's a
01:02 - fun game with automation Colony building
01:04 - and defense mechanics where you can
01:06 - build a colony you can automate it and
01:08 - keep the tiny defense on Slinky safe
01:09 - from harm there's a freedom where you
01:11 - can try out the release date is
01:12 - happening just next month so go ahead
01:14 - add it to your wishlist and phone for
01:15 - that ones alright so starting off at
01:17 - number 10 with a really awesome game
01:19 - made by a fellow gamedev YouTuber Jonas
01:21 - Tyrone despite being so young he has
01:23 - already had such an interesting career
01:24 - first he made a huge hit with unity with
01:27 - the game Islanders then he switched the
01:28 - game maker for Willing snail and now
01:30 - he's back to Unity with throngfall the
01:32 - game is a minimalist tower defense game
01:34 - basically they took the genre to its
01:36 - Bare Bones Basics and made that really
01:38 - satisfying you build up your Colony
01:40 - build some Mills together gold build
01:42 - some houses for troops use the coins to
01:44 - build up your Castle build some defenses
01:45 - gather more resources and create your
01:47 - army then the Night Comes the enemies
01:49 - attack and you can defend either by
01:51 - yourself or with your army it's a very
01:53 - minimalist but very satisfying game and
01:55 - it's already a massive hit over 5 000
01:58 - extremely positive reviews even though
01:59 - it it's only an early access that means
02:01 - it has probably sold already over 150
02:04 - 000 copies meaning already past 1
02:06 - million dollars in Revenue I've picked
02:08 - the game myself both to support Jonas
02:10 - and because it actually looks right up
02:12 - my alley I can't wait to find time to
02:13 - play it and if you're wondering is the
02:15 - game ahead just because of his YouTube
02:16 - channel the answer is not exactly I mean
02:18 - the channel certainly helps his devlogs
02:20 - are excellent and they get tons of views
02:22 - but more importantly his game really
02:24 - blew up in the last team nextfest he
02:26 - literally got a hundred thousand
02:27 - wishlists thanks to an excellent demo so
02:29 - if you doubt the power of steam
02:31 - festivals and wishlists and this is
02:32 - Clear Proof of just how much it matters
02:34 - so really huge congrats to Jonas this is
02:36 - a well-deserved massive hit on an
02:38 - excellent game next for an interesting
02:39 - one here is I am future a cozy
02:42 - apocalypse survival nowadays it's really
02:44 - hard to come up with a good name for a
02:45 - game but for this one the name really
02:47 - says it all it hooks you right away cozy
02:49 - apocalypse survival that's certainly a
02:51 - very unique twist despite being an
02:52 - unboxing lips game it looks very jolly
02:55 - very inviting with some very English
02:56 - Greenery it is also set on top of a
02:58 - skyscraper so that's an another thing
03:00 - that makes it quite unique among the Sea
03:02 - of survival games you can do some
03:04 - cooking some resource Gathering do some
03:06 - crafting farming fishing and so on so
03:08 - all the usual stuff then you can also
03:09 - create some robots and have them do all
03:11 - the work when they relax so it also has
03:13 - some nice automation elements and then
03:15 - you can explore this world and uncover
03:16 - the mystery behind why the apocalypse
03:18 - happen this is definitely a great fresh
03:20 - take on a very saturated genre it is out
03:22 - now in Early Access with already over a
03:24 - thousand very positive reviews then for
03:26 - a very dark ingredient in the sequel
03:28 - here is Blasphemous too it's a difficult
03:30 - punishing dark and greedy to the
03:32 - metroidvania if you like gorgeous pixel
03:34 - art then you will definitely enjoy this
03:35 - one it's got some really gorgeous art
03:37 - and animations the game also has some
03:39 - great 2D size rolling action people
03:40 - refer to this one and the prequel as 2D
03:43 - Dark Souls you can customize and improve
03:45 - your skill set you can equip various
03:47 - weapons and Master on the attacks you
03:48 - explore this huge unique world and
03:50 - engage in intense Boss Battles the story
03:52 - continues from the first one so you
03:53 - should probably play that one first if
03:55 - you're into the story but if you're just
03:56 - into 2D science rolling zones like
03:58 - gameplay then you can probably just jump
04:00 - into this one it is actually
04:01 - surprisingly expensive for a 2d size
04:03 - rolling game it's 30 bucks but it also
04:05 - already has over 2500 very positive
04:07 - views so it seems like the price is very
04:09 - well Justified next for something full
04:11 - of color here is Bomb brush cyberfunk
04:13 - this one is somewhat of a spiritual
04:15 - successor to Jet Set Radio you can
04:18 - immediately see that just by looking at
04:19 - a screenshot that's actually one game
04:21 - that I as a kid I thought was really
04:22 - awesome and I really wanted to play it
04:24 - but I never had a Dreamcast so I
04:26 - couldn't in this one you can ride a
04:27 - skateboard a bike or rollerblades you
04:30 - complete awesome tricks get tons of
04:31 - sound points paint some graffiti do some
04:34 - break dancing and fight the military
04:35 - police honestly there's actually
04:37 - something that I would have guessed is
04:38 - very Niche but apparently not it's
04:40 - already a huge hit with over 5000
04:42 - overwhelmingly positive reviews so if
04:44 - you're looking for something pretty
04:45 - unique then definitely give this one a
04:47 - shot then if you want some super
04:48 - fast-paced action check out turbo
04:50 - Overkill nowadays there are quite a lot
04:52 - of Boomer Shooters and this one seems
04:54 - like an absolutely excellent one it is
04:56 - extremely fast paced really non-stop
04:58 - moving and shooting you can do on Wheels
05:00 - SMGs you can pick up some powerful
05:02 - shotguns or some huge rockets and take
05:04 - out tons of enemies there's lots of
05:06 - bullets and blood flying all over the
05:08 - place the environments also seem
05:10 - extremely unique some look like hell so
05:12 - something straight out of Doom but
05:13 - others look like outer space and some
05:15 - look straight out of cyberpunk it can
05:17 - also drive a motorbike do some cool
05:19 - slides and shoot at the same time so if
05:21 - you're into this genre definitely go
05:23 - ahead and give this a try it already has
05:24 - over 3 000 overwhelmingly positive views
05:27 - so this one is a huge hit and people
05:29 - love it for some VR here is a curious
05:31 - one with a strange name it's called
05:33 - project third eye it's a VR physics
05:36 - interaction game with lots of player
05:37 - creativity so you've got regular
05:39 - shooting like normal but then you can
05:41 - also pick up some planks of wood and
05:43 - connect them together then you can pick
05:45 - up a circuit board you can attach it to
05:47 - the object and write some logic using
05:48 - some nice visual scripting it's
05:50 - certainly an interesting idea that has
05:51 - potential anytime you had code mixed
05:54 - with some objects it always makes for
05:55 - some interesting stuff although the
05:57 - reviews mention how it's a bit Bare
05:59 - Bones right now it's out in Early Access
06:00 - so perhaps keep an eye on this one over
06:02 - the coming months next if you're into
06:04 - nice airships and RPGs here is black
06:07 - scallions it's a top-down open world
06:09 - Airship management and combat game you
06:11 - fly around in your Airship and rescue
06:13 - friends or fight enemies you can pick
06:15 - from dozens of unique weapons choose
06:17 - from regular rifles or some special
06:19 - unique lighting weapons you also have
06:21 - different ships to choose from so will
06:23 - you pick something that is fast and
06:24 - Nimble or something slow and Powerful
06:26 - gather some resources and use them to
06:28 - upgrade your ship and your weapons
06:30 - explore a huge open world and liberate
06:32 - each island one by one while also
06:34 - encountering some unique missions and
06:36 - some unique NPCs visually it's got some
06:38 - really great gorgeous pixel art I
06:39 - especially love the explosions really
06:41 - bright very fiery personally I'm also
06:43 - always very interested to see in this
06:45 - second open world games so this is
06:47 - definitely appealing to me it has just
06:48 - graduated from Early Access and it's got
06:50 - over 1500 very positive reviews then for
06:53 - something that was already a huge hit
06:55 - and finally came to PC it's Marvel snap
06:57 - you've probably already heard of it it's
06:59 - one of the biggest mobile hits of the
07:01 - past few years personally I don't
07:02 - normally game on my phone but I've been
07:04 - interested in everything that I've heard
07:05 - about this game so I'm definitely happy
07:07 - to see it on PC the game itself is a
07:09 - card game with tons and tons of Marvel
07:11 - characters everything from the super
07:12 - popular ones is some very Niche very
07:14 - underground ones you collect all the
07:16 - heroes from the entirety of Marvel so
07:18 - that's really hundreds of unique
07:20 - superheroes and characters upgrade your
07:21 - cards head up your deck and do battle
07:23 - with other players as a Dev I would say
07:25 - you should probably play this game if
07:27 - not just to study the excellent polish
07:29 - every action in this game looks so
07:31 - extremely satisfying the cards are
07:33 - gorgeous very well built and every
07:34 - action is filled with excellent
07:36 - animations and effects it is free to
07:38 - play which for me is usually a bad thing
07:39 - but from what I've heard the
07:40 - monetization on this one seems pretty
07:42 - well done it is out now on seam and
07:44 - already has 17 000 very positive reviews
07:46 - then if you're into gorgeous adventure
07:48 - games here is a guidebook of Babel I
07:51 - really like the style on this one hand
07:52 - drawn in a really nice way you walk
07:54 - around and explore this world talk to
07:56 - NPCs and pick up quests to hunt them in
07:58 - their hour of need search for for Clues
08:00 - put together clues in your notebook and
08:02 - solve the mystery then go back in time
08:04 - and prevent the problem from ever
08:05 - happening however in doing so that will
08:07 - actually create a butterfly effect with
08:09 - lots of unintended consequences so the
08:11 - next time you go through the story
08:12 - things are going to be slightly
08:14 - different definitely seems like a very
08:15 - inventive mechanic for an adventure game
08:17 - it is out now with 300 reviews at 98
08:19 - positive so if you're a fan of this
08:21 - genre then definitely this looks like a
08:23 - great new one and at number one for my
08:25 - personal pick of the month here is
08:26 - Shadow Gambit the curse crew this is by
08:28 - the same developer that made Shadow
08:30 - tactics Blades of the Shogun and the
08:32 - really excellent Desperados 3. I finally
08:34 - got the time to play that one last month
08:36 - and I absolutely loved it I love these
08:37 - games I don't love this developer if
08:39 - you're not familiar these are stealth
08:41 - Action games you control a group of
08:43 - unique characters each with unique
08:44 - abilities all the enemies have their
08:46 - Patron routes they have very strict view
08:48 - cones and a very strict set of rules
08:50 - basically it's a game of perfect
08:52 - information there's no Randomness you
08:54 - can assess the world make a plan and
08:55 - execute if you're good you won't succeed
08:58 - right away but at the same time if you
08:59 - fail that's all right failure is
09:01 - absolutely part of the game that is why
09:02 - the game has a super fast quick save and
09:04 - quick load system you are supposed to do
09:06 - a quick save then try out your plan and
09:09 - if it fails you can either try to
09:10 - continue or simply quick move personally
09:12 - I always get stressed when I play some
09:14 - self games because failure is usually
09:15 - very punishing so I do love this system
09:18 - it feels absolutely excellent to queue
09:20 - up some actions on multiple characters
09:21 - then press a button to execute them all
09:24 - at once and watch as your plan goes to
09:26 - Perfection this one is all about Pirates
09:27 - and lots of awkward elements it is not
09:30 - meant to be realistic like their
09:31 - previous games which really allows them
09:33 - to play with some more otherworldly
09:34 - elements and abilities it is out now
09:36 - with 1500 reviews at 95 positive so this
09:40 - is a huge hit and people love it
09:41 - although even though this game is
09:43 - excellent sadly it comes with some bad
09:44 - news the developer actually disbanded
09:46 - right after release it looks like it's
09:48 - owned well and in the final message they
09:50 - mentioned how they're actually paying a
09:51 - bonus to their workers based on the
09:53 - profits so suddenly it just seems like
09:55 - the reason is making a game of this
09:56 - quality is really difficult especially
09:58 - on such a niche genre even though the
10:00 - final result is excellent it does seem
10:02 - like it took quite a bit of tone on the
10:03 - developers personally as someone who
10:05 - doesn't really have work-life balance I
10:07 - can definitely sympathize with that I
10:08 - can admire their decision to Value the
10:10 - well-being of the team as opposed to
10:12 - starting on another massive project
10:13 - right away while at the same time I'm
10:15 - very sad that they shut down there's no
10:16 - one else making games in this excellent
10:18 - but very nice genre and they had
10:20 - completely mastered it so I really wish
10:22 - the best to the rest of the team who
10:23 - knows maybe some of these Sim members
10:25 - will take that bonus and start their own
10:27 - Studio to continue this Legacy alright
10:29 - so that's 10 awesome new games made with
10:30 - the Indian launch in August 23 I hope
10:33 - this list on DC how DMT engine is
10:34 - capable of building anything the limits
10:36 - are really just your own skills and
10:37 - Imagination check out my own gaming
10:39 - Guardians and edit your wishlist
