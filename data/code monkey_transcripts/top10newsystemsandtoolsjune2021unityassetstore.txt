00:04 - and assets to help you make your own
00:05 - games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:07 - coming out every month so in this video
00:09 - let's check out some highlights that
00:10 - were released in may 2021
00:12 - this one is the list of paid systems and
00:15 - tools in the last video i already
00:16 - covered the best three new assets so if
00:18 - you haven't seen it go watch that one
00:20 - let me know which ones of these you're
00:22 - most interested in and i might do a
00:23 - detailed review on it
00:25 - and in the next video i will be covering
00:27 - the top assets and effects
00:29 - as always there's links to the assets in
00:30 - the description and as a bonus you can
00:32 - use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10
00:34 - off your order
00:36 - and by the way check out my own assets
00:37 - on the store so far i've made the free
00:39 - key door system which is a super simple
00:41 - way to add keys and doors to your games
00:44 - and the mouse cursor system pro which is
00:46 - a very easy to use tool to help you
00:48 - create some custom animated cursors to
00:50 - really make your game stand out
00:51 - i'm currently working on converting some
00:53 - more videos into pro systems so stay
00:55 - tuned for that
00:56 - alright so starting off with feel it's
00:58 - an awesome tool to make your game feel
01:00 - really good
01:01 - now this one is actually a compilation
01:03 - of three other assets
01:05 - one you might be familiar with is mm
01:07 - feedbacks and if you already own that
01:09 - asset then you can get a free upgrade to
01:11 - this one which is always great
01:13 - so this is a series of tools to really
01:15 - add some next level polish into your
01:17 - games
01:17 - easily add some camera shake along with
01:19 - some particles and maybe some sound
01:21 - effects with some post processing
01:23 - just looking at the trailer you can
01:24 - really get a feel for how big of a
01:26 - difference it is between the
01:27 - unpolished and the polished experience
01:29 - if you're working on a game
01:31 - always make sure you actively polish
01:32 - what you have polish is what separates
01:34 - good games from great games
01:36 - this definitely a package that i intend
01:38 - to do a full review sometime in the
01:39 - future
01:40 - then a simple but great tool named
01:42 - pixelate it lets you take a 3d mesh
01:45 - along with animations and converts it
01:47 - into a pixelated spreadsheet
01:49 - this is the same process that was used
01:51 - to make the awesome game dead cells
01:53 - it makes for a very interesting look
01:55 - with some extremely smooth and correct
01:57 - pixel animations
01:58 - also it generates the normal maps so
02:00 - your pixelated sprites can then be
02:02 - affected by lights to look even better
02:04 - if this is the art sound that you're
02:06 - going for then this tool will definitely
02:08 - save you a ton of time if you're
02:09 - interested in ar
02:11 - here is a complete ar shooter package
02:13 - it's a simple project but seems great if
02:15 - you want to learn
02:16 - pick up your phone point at the
02:18 - environment and shoot the zombies
02:20 - i've never touched ar but this is the
02:21 - kind of complete package that is great
02:23 - to download to break apart to inspect
02:25 - how everything is done
02:26 - next up easily add a very capable
02:28 - movement system to your characters
02:30 - this one just came out and already has
02:32 - tons of extremely positive reviews
02:35 - this is the second version to another
02:37 - character movement system and that one
02:39 - also has extremely positive reviews so
02:41 - this is a very solid package
02:43 - it includes 30 examples for you to try
02:45 - out and see just how versatile this
02:47 - asset is
02:48 - the demo scene has pretty much every
02:49 - environment obstacle you can think of
02:51 - you've got ramps stairs gravel seesaws
02:54 - ledges
02:55 - low gravity and just about anything
02:57 - works with both of the input systems
03:00 - and also it has integration with bond so
03:02 - that's great if you're working on a game
03:03 - using primarily visual scripting
03:06 - next up a package to handle the new
03:08 - iphone idfa rules
03:10 - now i'm not very familiar with mobile
03:12 - development so no idea just how hard it
03:14 - is to handle the new changes or how easy
03:16 - this package makes it
03:18 - but if you are a mobile developer then
03:20 - maybe give this a look
03:21 - then an interesting one should graph
03:23 - markdown
03:24 - so this is kind of like odin inspector
03:26 - but for shadowgraph
03:28 - it lets you create some editors some
03:30 - foldouts make some inline texture and
03:32 - color feels
03:33 - looking at the comparison images it
03:35 - definitely can make a huge difference
03:37 - if you have some giant shaders then this
03:39 - can be a huge help in organizing them
03:41 - works with unity shadowgraph and also
03:44 - with the amplify shader editor
03:46 - next up terrain to mesh like the name
03:48 - implies it converts a terrain object
03:50 - into a simple mesh
03:52 - this is a new upgraded and improved
03:54 - version of the all terrain to mesh
03:55 - system that was made all the way back in
03:57 - 2015 so it should be a very mature
03:59 - package
04:00 - easily generate with as much or as
04:02 - little detail as you want
04:04 - so maybe you have some highly detailed
04:06 - terrain in the background of your games
04:07 - and you can use this to simplify it and
04:09 - get some better performance
04:10 - you can export pretty much anything
04:12 - related to terrains it's got a huge
04:14 - number of options
04:16 - then the advanced screenshot creators
04:18 - it's got all kinds of options for taking
04:20 - screenshots
04:21 - this is an editor tool so it's not meant
04:24 - for players to take screenshots in the
04:25 - final build
04:26 - instead it's for example for marketing
04:28 - purposes you can very easily take a
04:30 - bunch of screenshots with all kinds of
04:32 - resolution and aspect ratios
04:34 - so usually when you submit a game to a
04:36 - store like steam there's a bunch of
04:37 - capsules you need to submit
04:39 - so i can see this being useful for that
04:41 - or you can also take a 360 degree
04:43 - screenshot so maybe this could be useful
04:45 - for integrating with the phone and
04:46 - making some very quick 360 view
04:48 - of the inside of a house or something
04:51 - next up here is simple fog of war
04:53 - i've previously covered how to do a
04:55 - field of view effect in another video
04:57 - but what i covered there was a method
04:59 - using the cpu
05:00 - whereas this one is gpu based so it's
05:03 - highly performant
05:04 - you define a certain width height and
05:06 - resolution and the fog perfectly matches
05:08 - the character and identifies the edges
05:10 - it's got some nice smooth edges and even
05:12 - merges with other friendly objects
05:15 - so it's a great asset for any strategy
05:17 - game like an rts or maybe a moba game
05:20 - and finally you've got expanse create
05:22 - some gorgeous volumetric skies with
05:24 - this tool all changes are visible in the
05:26 - editor so there's no need to go into
05:28 - play mode
05:29 - super fast iteration it is all
05:31 - physically accurate so it looks
05:33 - extremely realistic but there is also a
05:36 - bunch of options for you to choose from
05:37 - between quality and performance
05:40 - it is hdrp only and it looks gorgeous
05:43 - alright so those are my top 10 new tools
05:45 - and systems on the unity asset store
05:47 - that were released in may 2021
05:49 - there's links to all in the description
05:51 - and remember you can use the coupon code
05:53 - monkey10 to get 10
