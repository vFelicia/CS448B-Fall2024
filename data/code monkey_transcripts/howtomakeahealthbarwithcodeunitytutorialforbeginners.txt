00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - in this video we're going to create a
00:03 - health bar from code and control it
00:05 - let's begin
00:09 - alright so in the previous video we made
00:11 - this 1/2 bar in here visually you can
00:13 - see that it has a bar a background and a
00:16 - border the bar has a pivot on the left
00:19 - side and is an increasing in size when
00:22 - it gets low it flashes in white so we
00:24 - can both modify the size and the color
00:26 - of our bar now let's create the whole
00:29 - thing through code now you could use a
00:31 - prefab and in Senshi at the example like
00:33 - in the editor but we're going to do the
00:35 - whole thing straight through code this
00:37 - way if we want to use this bar in a
00:38 - different project all we have to do is
00:40 - copy the script and there's no need to
00:41 - create a package that also includes the
00:43 - prefab so here in the editor let's
00:45 - review what we're going to create so
00:48 - first of all we have a parent game
00:49 - object in here it has no components as
00:52 - you can see only the health bar script
00:53 - and it has a scale of 1 1 so it is not
00:56 - scaled at all then we have the
00:59 - background which is placed on locum
01:02 - position 0 0 and has a bar size on the
01:05 - local scale it is also tinted in grey
01:08 - then we have the bar game object which
01:11 - as you can see is shifted to the left
01:13 - side by half of the size size of our bar
01:16 - is 40 and this when you shift to the
01:18 - left by 20 we're placing it in here so
01:21 - we can essentially have the inner bar
01:23 - pivoted to the left side so we can
01:25 - modify this one and there you go it's
01:27 - pivoted on the left side okay again
01:29 - there's also no components in here then
01:32 - we have the bar sprite as a child of the
01:34 - bar and in here we do have a sprite
01:36 - renderer it is tinted in red as you can
01:38 - see it has the same size as the
01:40 - background 45 and it is shifted to the
01:43 - right side so if we set this on 1 you
01:47 - can see that it is shifted in there so
01:48 - it occupies exactly the same position
01:50 - but the parent is pivoted on the left
01:52 - side so we can easily modify it in here
01:54 - ok and for the border let's just ignore
01:58 - that for now so this whole thing is what
02:00 - we're going to create through code let's
02:02 - go into the health bar class and up here
02:06 - we're going to make a static function to
02:08 - create a health bar so let's make a
02:09 - public static health bar and we're going
02:12 - to call it create now in here in order
02:16 - to create we're going to receive a
02:17 - vector3 for the
02:19 - position on which to spawn the health
02:21 - bar and a vector3 for the size of the
02:24 - hump bar so let's begin by making the
02:26 - main game object so game object let's
02:29 - call it count bar game object and to be
02:33 - any game object in college health bar
02:36 - we're going to put the health bar game
02:39 - object out transform that position into
02:41 - our position the scale of this bar will
02:44 - leave it at 1 now let's make the
02:47 - background so game object background
02:50 - game object equals a new game object
02:53 - we're going to call it background and
02:55 - we're also going to initialize it with a
02:58 - sprite renderer component let's set the
03:02 - parent to the main container so going
03:04 - background transform dot set parent to
03:07 - our health bar game object transform now
03:11 - let's set the local position to keep it
03:15 - at vector 3.0 and for the local scale
03:19 - it's going to be the size that we
03:21 - receive and let's go into the background
03:24 - market component sprite renderer to set
03:27 - the color to color gray okay so our
03:32 - background is now working now since this
03:34 - is a sprite renderer we need to give it
03:36 - a sprite otherwise it won't be visible
03:38 - now in order to get a reference to the
03:41 - asset pick so I'm going to use a script
03:43 - that we created previously called the
03:44 - game assets you can view the entire
03:47 - video on this script but essentially it
03:49 - lets me drag references to this scripts
03:52 - prefab and then access it anywhere
03:54 - through code so in here I have a film
03:56 - for the white pixel sprite and I can
03:59 - access it using this property so I go
04:02 - through this property to access this
04:03 - white pixel so in my home farm let's go
04:07 - again to the sprite grant component and
04:09 - set the sprite to the game assets dot I
04:12 - dot white pixel alright so this way the
04:16 - background should now be fully visible
04:18 - now let's make the bar game object game
04:21 - object bar game object and say to be you
04:24 - game object then let's name it bar
04:26 - inside we're going to set the parent
04:29 - transform that said parent to our helper
04:33 - game object transform now as we saw
04:35 - previously this is simply the container
04:38 - for the pivot for our actual bar sprite
04:40 - so let's first make the bar sprite so
04:44 - let's make a bar sprite game object and
04:47 - we're going to call it bar sprite let's
04:49 - copy the background code in here and for
04:53 - the transform the bar sprite game object
04:57 - the transform will be the bar game
04:59 - object and not the main game object
05:01 - let's set the bar color to red and again
05:04 - give it the white pixel now for the
05:07 - unlocking position as we saw previously
05:09 - we have to offset this by half of the
05:12 - size so for this Fred game object we
05:15 - want to offset it to the right so let's
05:17 - put this on new vector3 of the size X
05:20 - divided by 2 ax so half of the size and
05:23 - leave it on 0 F and then for the main
05:26 - bar appear for the bar game project we
05:29 - need to put it to the left by that
05:31 - offset okay so you don't let's make some
05:34 - comments ooh so this isn't look as messy
05:36 - so in here we are creating the main
05:39 - health bar then we are creating the
05:43 - background then in here we are creating
05:45 - the bar and here the bar sprite alright
05:50 - so this is much easier to now understand
05:52 - so one last thing let's set the sorting
05:55 - order so for the background game object
05:58 - is going to be at the bottom so grab the
06:00 - sprite renderer and set the sorting
06:03 - order to let's say 100 and for the
06:06 - sprite
06:07 - let's put the sprite at 110 so the
06:09 - sprite is on top of the game object and
06:12 - finally let's have this help our script
06:14 - into the main game object so we got here
06:17 - the health bar game object we're going
06:19 - to add the component which is this
06:21 - health bar script and this is the health
06:24 - bar bar and it is what we're going to
06:28 - return from this function so up here
06:31 - this function returns a health bar and
06:32 - that's what we return ok so now let's go
06:35 - into the game Amalur and create a bar in
06:37 - here let's first comment out this
06:39 - previous code we're going to use it for
06:41 - testing later
06:43 - and in here let's go into the health bar
06:45 - dot create and now in order to create
06:47 - first we need the position so let's put
06:50 - it on zero zero and then a size let's
06:53 - put it the same size as previously which
06:55 - was 45 now let's go in the editor and
06:58 - let's disable this old health bar so the
07:01 - editor you can see nothing is visible
07:02 - nothing is visible so now when we run it
07:05 - should spawn a new health bar yep there
07:08 - it is our new bar created internally
07:10 - through code is working perfectly and if
07:12 - I pause the game you can see in the
07:14 - scene this is the one we created
07:16 - previously and this is the one we
07:17 - created through code and as you can see
07:19 - it's got a background it's got the bar
07:20 - and it's got the bar sprite and we can
07:22 - still modify the bar and there you go it
07:24 - shifts exactly as previously okay great
07:27 - so now let's apply the animation we were
07:29 - doing previously to make sure everything
07:31 - still works so after we create the
07:33 - health bar we actually returning home
07:35 - bar so we can get rid of that global
07:38 - health bar and making you one game here
07:40 - alright then now let's again apply the
07:43 - same code as previously everything is
07:45 - working with the health bar so it should
07:47 - be working exactly the same so let's try
07:51 - yep there you go there's the bar it is
07:53 - lowering in size it's now flashes when
07:56 - it's low and goes back to normal okay
07:58 - great so we have successfully created
07:59 - the bar through code and are now
08:01 - manipulating using the code we wrote
08:03 - previously so now let's add a border to
08:06 - our bar let's go to our bar create
08:10 - function and let's essentially duplicate
08:12 - our background bar and we're going to
08:15 - name this the border and let's call it
08:18 - the border let's rename all of these
08:21 - references let's put the sorting order
08:25 - under the actual bar and let's put the
08:28 - color in black now for the size let's
08:32 - put it at the normal size plus a certain
08:34 - float border thickness let's say one app
08:39 - and in here size Florida's vector 3.1
08:42 - multiplied by the border thickness so
08:45 - this will increase the size by one F on
08:47 - all sides so now let's see and we should
08:50 - be seeing a black border around our bar
08:53 - as we had previously yep there you go a
08:56 - nice
08:56 - black border okay so now let's customize
08:58 - our bar
09:00 - let's begin by customizing the border so
09:03 - let's go up here and make a public class
09:05 - and we're going to call it border now
09:08 - inside this class we're going to have
09:10 - two values first of all a public float
09:13 - for the thickness of the border and a
09:15 - public color for the color of the border
09:18 - and on our health bar create function
09:21 - we're going to receive a border class
09:24 - object and by default let's leave it at
09:27 - No
09:28 - so in here if border it is not no then
09:32 - we are going to execute this and create
09:35 - a border but if it is no leave it
09:37 - without a border and in here instead of
09:40 - using this border thickness in here
09:41 - we're going to use the one given in the
09:43 - border object so go to the border and
09:46 - get the thickness and go into the border
09:48 - and get the color all right so now in
09:52 - our game handler let's make another bar
09:54 - so let's make another bar above that one
09:57 - so let's put it on ten and in here we're
10:00 - going to give it a new border and the
10:04 - border won't have a thickness of 1 F and
10:06 - let's give it a color of color dot white
10:09 - so we have a health bar being created
10:12 - using the default border which means no
10:15 - border so we're not sending anything in
10:16 - there and a second one with a white
10:18 - border so let's see if both of our bars
10:20 - are being created exactly as they should
10:22 - yep there you go we got one normal
10:25 - border no bar and one with a white
10:27 - border all right now let's also add some
10:30 - parameters for setting the bar color and
10:32 - the background color so in the health
10:35 - bar dot create let's receive a color for
10:38 - the bar color and a color for the
10:40 - background color and we're going to
10:44 - apply it down here so the background
10:46 - instead of calling up gray get that
10:48 - color and the bar color instead of
10:50 - colored on red let's give it our bar
10:52 - color so let's go in our game Handler
10:55 - and first of all let's give the normal
10:57 - colors to this one so for the bar color
11:00 - let's give it card out red background
11:02 - color up gray and do the same thing this
11:05 - one down here and then above this one
11:08 - let's greet another helpful
11:09 - I'm going to put it on 20 and let's say
11:13 - the color will be yellow the background
11:16 - color let's put that white and for the
11:19 - border let's put it on black all right
11:22 - so now as you can see we are using the
11:25 - same function and creating three very
11:27 - different bars let's see them
11:28 - yep there you we first got a red bar
11:31 - with no border then we got a yellow bar
11:34 - with a black border any red bar with a
11:36 - light grey background and a white border
11:38 - all these are created using the same
11:40 - function and all of them were created
11:42 - through code so we have been calling
11:45 - this a health bar but really this code
11:46 - is really just a bar if you change the
11:49 - color to let's say a blue you could use
11:51 - it to represent a cool-down
11:52 - or a action bar we are making the
11:55 - animation lowering the size but we could
11:57 - just as easily set it to increase so
11:59 - what we have here is a very versatile
12:01 - bar so essentially what we have created
12:04 - here is the world bar class from the
12:06 - code monkey utilities you can grab the
12:09 - eternities for free from unity code
12:10 - monkey comm and check out the warm bar
12:12 - class to see how that one was
12:14 - implemented and what other functions it
12:16 - has so there you have it we create a
12:18 - health bar both in the editor and
12:21 - through code we made a function to
12:22 - easily create a bar on the fly with
12:24 - customization for size collars and
12:26 - border if you have any questions post
12:28 - them in the comments and I'll do my best
12:30 - to answer them subscribe for more videos
12:32 - and I'll see you next time
12:44 - you
