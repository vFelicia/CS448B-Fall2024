00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - in this video we're continuing to create
00:03 - modular spreadsheets as used in battle
00:05 - royale Tycoon we're going to take on the
00:07 - parameters we've been using to save and
00:09 - load the exact same spreadsheet every
00:10 - time let's begin
00:14 - so far in the series we've dynamically
00:16 - created this spreadsheet we have options
00:19 - for multiple skin colors multiple hair
00:22 - and beard colors and also various beard
00:25 - and hair styles and finally we have
00:27 - multiple bodies with a primary and a
00:29 - secondary color so now with all of these
00:32 - parameters we're going to implement
00:33 - saving and loading so we can correctly
00:35 - load the very same spreadsheet every
00:37 - time we're going to use Jason to keep
00:39 - our final format simple if you're not
00:41 - familiar with Jason check out my series
00:43 - on how to make a simple save system the
00:45 - game is out now on Steam so check it out
00:47 - to see what I'm teaching here apply to a
00:49 - real game so here in our code and let's
00:51 - define a class to hold our spreadsheet
00:53 - data we are going to make this a very
00:55 - simple class and in here we're going to
00:58 - store a int for the hair index also
01:02 - another one for the beard index and the
01:05 - body index so those are the indexes that
01:08 - compose our spreadsheet then we have a
01:11 - public color
01:12 - first let's store the hair color then we
01:15 - need the skin color and then the body
01:18 - primary color and the body secondary
01:21 - color
01:22 - alright so these are all the parameters
01:24 - that we use when creating our guest
01:26 - prett so in here let's create a function
01:28 - to generate a random guest spreadsheet
01:30 - data so we make it a public it's gonna
01:33 - return get spreadsheet data and just
01:36 - call it generate random and let's make
01:39 - this a static function so here in our
01:42 - code we can see how we were grabbing our
01:44 - values so let's copy the array for the
01:46 - various skin colors then we pick a skin
01:49 - call ok and then we have the various
01:52 - hair colors for the body primary and
01:55 - secondary let's keep a simple one and
02:00 - for the indexes of the hair and beard we
02:03 - are grabbing them in here so we define
02:06 - our hair index and if we have hair we
02:09 - choose a random one and if not then we
02:11 - simply set our hair index to minus one
02:14 - and we're going to do the exact same
02:15 - thing for our beard index and finally
02:21 - our body index all right so just like
02:23 - that we are correctly pick
02:25 - random parameters that we need to create
02:27 - our spreadsheet so now after we have
02:29 - created all these let's return a
02:31 - spreadsheet data object we're going to
02:34 - create it using these indexes okay so
02:42 - here is our final object which contains
02:44 - our random parameters so now just for
02:47 - testing let's try saving this object so
02:50 - on the game camera we're on awake in
02:52 - here let's simply get a guest
02:54 - spreadsheet data and we're going to go
02:57 - into the guest spreadsheet data and
02:58 - generate a random data object now in
03:01 - here we want to convert it into JSON so
03:03 - we're going to use the JSON utility dot
03:06 - to Jason we're going to convert our
03:09 - guest spreadsheet data into JSON and for
03:12 - now let's just print it on the console
03:14 - so we can see what this returns and yep
03:17 - here it is on the console you can see
03:19 - our JSON representation of our guest
03:21 - save data object you can see the hair
03:24 - index beard the next body and the
03:25 - various colors alright so now let's try
03:28 - saving and loading soon here let's make
03:30 - a function to return void and this will
03:34 - be our save function now the simplest
03:37 - way to save persistent data is using
03:39 - player price so we're going to use that
03:40 - here we do a set the string and we give
03:45 - it our JSON string
03:54 - so we are grabbing the adjacent string
03:56 - from this object and we are setting the
03:58 - string with the key guess spreadsheet on
04:00 - it to contain our JSON string and then
04:03 - we're going to have another function a
04:04 - public void load and in here we're going
04:08 - to load it from the player preps so we
04:10 - go into the point price and do a get
04:13 - string and get the this string that was
04:16 - saved previously alright so this is our
04:19 - string for our adjacent string so now
04:22 - let's print out our g string on saving
04:24 - and loading just make sure everything is
04:26 - working correctly so here on our game
04:30 - hammer let's just do our guess
04:31 - spreadsheet data first we save and then
04:34 - we unload all right so let's see if both
04:36 - strings match and yep here's the code in
04:39 - there as you can see they both look
04:41 - exactly the same so we are correctly
04:43 - saving and loading using player preps
04:45 - and using JSON to contain our file
04:47 - format okay now I have added to debug
04:57 - buttons to save and load so in here
04:59 - using this one let's save it and yep
05:02 - okay he saved here index of one beard
05:04 - minus one and body of three so now let's
05:07 - reload the scene and now when I hit load
05:10 - we should be able to see 1-1 and three
05:12 - hit load and yep there you go 1 minus 1
05:14 - 3 okay great so we have saving and
05:17 - loading working perfectly now all we
05:19 - need is to actually apply it to our
05:20 - texture so in here let's modify this
05:23 - function to instead of using get texture
05:25 - we are going to receive a guest
05:28 - spreadsheet data as a parameter and in
05:31 - here instead of grabbing from a skin
05:33 - color array we grab the skin color from
05:35 - the data and do the same thing for all
05:38 - of our parameters
05:49 - okay so we have replaced all of our
05:52 - random parameters with the ones given by
05:54 - this class and here let's modify this
05:57 - function to be cept guest spreadsheet
06:00 - data we're going to receive how are you
06:02 - get spreadsheet data and it's what we're
06:04 - going to use to generate our texture so
06:06 - here we generate a random one and then
06:08 - we set it to this one and then our load
06:10 - button we are going to first of all load
06:13 - our data then we set it using the new
06:17 - data
06:22 - okay so in here one last thing we need
06:24 - is after we get our JSON string we need
06:27 - to convert it back into our data object
06:29 - so instead of having a load function
06:32 - we're going to have a static which will
06:34 - return a guest spreadsheet data call it
06:37 - load static and again it goes through
06:40 - that gets the JSON string and then we do
06:43 - jason utility dot from jason we want to
06:46 - convert it back into a guest spreadsheet
06:48 - data and we give it our JSON string and
06:51 - this is what we're going to return okay
06:55 - so here's our character with a blonde
06:56 - Mohawk in the Mon mustache so now I hit
07:00 - save and there you there's a safe string
07:02 - that was saved
07:03 - we got the hair index beard hair call
07:05 - and so on now let's reset the scene and
07:07 - again here's another random and we hit
07:10 - random a couple times and now if I hit
07:11 - load if there go there it's the exact
07:14 - same character as previously and
07:16 - randomize load and we can always grab
07:18 - the same character back the game is out
07:21 - no one seems so check it out to see what
07:23 - I'm teaching here apply to a real game
07:24 - so there you have it we took our
07:26 - dynamically created sprite sheet and
07:28 - added the ability to save on parameters
07:30 - so we can load the same sprite sheet at
07:32 - will as always you can download the
07:34 - project files in utilities from unity
07:35 - code monkey comm if you have any
07:37 - questions post them in the comments and
07:38 - I'll do my best answer them subscribe
07:40 - for more videos and I'll see you next
07:42 - time
