00:00 - in this video we're going to look at the
00:01 - recently unveiled unity open projects
00:04 - this is a really interesting new
00:05 - initiative where a game will be made
00:07 - partly by unity and partly by the
00:09 - community
00:10 - there's a public roadmap and a public
00:11 - github where anyone can contribute to
00:13 - the project
00:14 - let's begin
00:19 - all right so a few days ago unity
00:21 - announced their new initiative called
00:23 - unity open projects
00:24 - i think this is an awesome idea and i
00:26 - look forward to seeing how the community
00:28 - will react
00:29 - there's an official blog post linked in
00:30 - the description with all details
00:32 - but essentially this is a project that
00:34 - is being made by a team from unity while
00:36 - at the same time being open to
00:37 - contributions from the community
00:39 - there is a public roadmap where you can
00:41 - see a general idea of where the game
00:42 - will go
00:43 - so here you have a ton of information on
00:45 - these readme cards so just click on each
00:47 - card and you can read it
00:48 - then down here we have the game design
00:50 - wiki which tells you a bunch of things
00:52 - about
00:52 - the game and what it's supposed to be
00:54 - but again the home point is to be made
00:55 - in conjunction with the community
00:57 - so as time goes on and more people
00:59 - contribute more systems and ailments the
01:01 - design for this will definitely change
01:02 - over time
01:03 - essentially the goal is to make a nice
01:05 - small complete game combining tons of
01:06 - contributions both from the official
01:08 - uniting team as well as anyone who wants
01:10 - to contribute so this will be a project
01:12 - that will go on for several months
01:14 - and every few weeks there will be live
01:16 - streams talking about the state of the
01:17 - project as well as some individual
01:19 - tutorials
01:20 - now personally i think this has the
01:21 - potential to be an awesome stepping
01:22 - stone in between making quick game jams
01:25 - and making a complete game
01:26 - with this you can focus on just a single
01:28 - system or element
01:29 - and contribute to the final game so that
01:31 - can be a great way to learn
01:33 - then the final game will be published on
01:34 - steam as a free download
01:36 - so i look forward to going through the
01:37 - credits and seeing how many people
01:39 - contributed to this final project
01:41 - alright so let's take a look at the
01:42 - project in its current starting state
01:45 - so just clone the github repository and
01:47 - open the project in unity
01:49 - here is the basic starter scene so like
01:52 - i said the goal of this initiative
01:53 - is to make a game with the community so
01:55 - what we have here is pretty much just a
01:57 - very simple prototype
01:58 - we have this player character and we can
02:00 - move around this map
02:01 - and as you can see there's a camera
02:03 - following we have basic movement
02:04 - direction
02:05 - and we have a nice jump so we can jump
02:07 - around then on the world itself you can
02:09 - see a whole bunch of platforms and walls
02:11 - as well as over here we have a nice
02:13 - terrain object so over here what we have
02:15 - is just the absolute essentials to get
02:17 - started on so you can already imagine
02:18 - populating this with tons of objects
02:20 - with proper textures and animations
02:22 - then adding some enemies some combat
02:24 - some sort of quest system
02:25 - inventory and so on then there's also
02:28 - another branch in the repository with
02:29 - the toon shader
02:30 - so over here we can see our main pick
02:32 - character it's using a really nice
02:34 - cartoony shader effect
02:36 - now personally i really like this art
02:37 - style and the shader itself is made in
02:39 - shadowgraph so if you want to see how to
02:41 - make a toon shader
02:42 - just go ahead grab the project and you
02:43 - can inspect this alright so for now
02:45 - that's pretty much it
02:47 - here we have just a bare bones prototype
02:49 - which works as a perfect blank canvas
02:51 - for everyone to start contributing to
02:52 - by the way there's also an interview
02:54 - with zero who is the lead on this
02:56 - project over on the infallible code
02:58 - channel so if you want more details
02:59 - check that out
03:00 - and there's also a step-by-step guide on
03:02 - how to contribute made by dapper dino
03:04 - so check out both those videos linked in
03:05 - the description now like i said i'm
03:07 - really excited for this project this is
03:09 - actually something that i have thought
03:10 - about doing on this channel but the
03:12 - logistics of it are very complicated so
03:14 - i won't be paying very close attention
03:15 - to how this project develops
03:17 - i really hope the whole unity community
03:19 - finds this an interesting idea and
03:20 - contributes to the final game
03:21 - i certainly intend to contribute to the
03:23 - project and i hope that you won't too
03:25 - i'm recording this just one day after
03:27 - the project was officially announced and
03:28 - there's already tons of discussion
03:30 - happening on the forums and already a
03:31 - bunch of people have contributed to the
03:33 - project so it's off to a great start
03:35 - and as you can see the name is unity
03:37 - open projects in plural meaning that if
03:39 - this project is successful this could
03:41 - become a really interesting ongoing
03:42 - series
03:43 - perhaps the next one won't be on making
03:45 - a strategy game or maybe something open
03:47 - world or a driving game or pretty much
03:48 - anything
03:49 - alright so that's the unity open
03:51 - projects initiative it's a great way to
03:53 - make a complete game as part of the
03:54 - unity community
03:55 - now go ahead check it out and contribute
03:57 - something to the project
03:58 - this video is made possible thanks to
04:00 - these awesome supporters go to
