00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - miniseries were making snake in unity in
00:03 - this video we're going to set up the UI
00:05 - so we can display our score let's begin
00:10 - okay so here is our game so far we can
00:13 - move around with a snake there is food
00:15 - being spawn which we can eat which makes
00:18 - the snake grow and we can also go into
00:20 - the size and these snake wraps around to
00:23 - the other side of the unlevel so now we
00:25 - want to display the current score in the
00:27 - UI so here in the editor let's go inside
00:30 - the game handler game object not to keep
00:32 - our scene nice and organized and now in
00:35 - here let's make a new game object and
00:37 - we're going to call this the UI and here
00:39 - you can leave it on any position but
00:41 - personally I'd like to put it to the
00:42 - side so let's put it on a thousand on
00:44 - the X and a thousand on the Z so just
00:46 - like that this is our UI on the side and
00:49 - our scene is in there okay this way in
00:52 - the scene view the UI is not blocking
00:54 - the origin of our game scene all right
00:56 - so this game object is a container for
00:58 - the you are so inside let's create a
01:01 - canvas and as you can see the event
01:03 - system was automatically created so
01:05 - let's drag it inside there and now here
01:07 - in the options for our canvas let's
01:10 - change the render mode from screen space
01:12 - overlay into screen space camera this
01:14 - allows you to assign a camera that will
01:15 - display the UI which is what we're going
01:17 - to do so let's create that camera create
01:20 - a new camera let's call this the UI
01:23 - camera make it a orthographic camera to
01:27 - be in 2d and give it a size of a hundred
01:29 - and now drag that camera onto our canvas
01:31 - so just like that we've got a camera
01:33 - that is displaying everything that is in
01:35 - do you want seen here for example I can
01:37 - create a UI image there is in the game
01:40 - scene we have an image being displayed
01:41 - okay also on our camera options make
01:44 - sure you change the clear flags to don't
01:46 - clear that way our main camera is still
01:48 - visible behind the u1 back in the canvas
01:51 - on the canvas scaler for the scale mode
01:53 - let's select scale with screen size this
01:57 - resizes the UI elements to fit the
01:59 - screen and resolution and the reference
02:01 - resolution is the main resolution for
02:03 - your UI if the color resolution is
02:05 - smaller everything will be scaled down
02:06 - and if it's bigger it won't be scaled up
02:08 - so when developing for desktop I don't
02:11 - like to set it to 720p so 1280 by 720
02:14 - and for the match mode and let's fully
02:16 - match with the height so for example if
02:19 - I go in here and I change the aspect
02:20 - ratio you can see that the square was
02:22 - not
02:22 - sighs it maintains the same size but if
02:25 - I drag the window and make it smaller on
02:27 - the vertical axis then you can see that
02:29 - the square is correctly being resized so
02:32 - with you I set up like this you can
02:34 - place everything vertically and only
02:35 - have to worry about horizontal movement
02:37 - and the reference pixels per unit leave
02:39 - it at 100 okay so now our UI is
02:42 - correctly set up now inside the canvas
02:44 - is where we're going to put any UI
02:46 - objects so let's create a game object
02:48 - for the score window and inside our
02:51 - score window we're going to need a text
02:53 - object to display the current score so a
02:55 - new UI text object this will be our
02:59 - score text okay so just like that we
03:11 - have a nice text field to display our
03:13 - current score so now let's make a script
03:16 - to handle it so in our scripts folder
03:18 - make a new C sharp script
03:19 - this will be our spore window now in
03:22 - here let's set up a private Boyd awake
03:24 - where we're going to grab the reference
03:26 - for our text object so here okay so we
03:35 - now have a reference to our score text
03:37 - which we can change to have the actual
03:39 - score so now we actually need to deal
03:42 - with creating the score so we're going
03:44 - to do that on the game handler so in
03:46 - here let's go all the way down here and
03:48 - we're going to store it as static so we
03:51 - can easily grab it from our UI window so
03:54 - first let's go up here make a private
03:56 - static game handler in order to store a
03:58 - instance and we're going to set it on
04:00 - our private void awake and then let's
04:05 - have the private static int to store our
04:08 - score and down here let's make some
04:10 - functions to manage our scores in here
04:18 - so we have a nice function to return the
04:20 - score and let's also make one in order
04:22 - to add score
04:25 - so we similarly increase the score by
04:27 - 100 okay so this is very simple and we
04:29 - now have a nice score in a static
04:32 - variable in our game hammer so we can
04:34 - now go into our score window and here
04:36 - make a private void update and on our
04:39 - update let's set these score text dot
04:41 - text to be from the game handler dot get
04:45 - score so we ask the game hammer to get
04:48 - the score and we update our score text
04:50 - so very quickly let's see if it says
04:52 - zero when we run our code and yep
04:55 - there's the score text being updated in
04:57 - order to say zero okay so now obviously
05:00 - we need to actually call our game hammer
05:02 - that score so we're going to increase
05:05 - score every time we eat some food so
05:07 - let's go into the unleavened bread and
05:08 - here we have the snake trying to eat
05:10 - some food and if it does successfully
05:13 - eat the food we destroy the food game
05:14 - objects but another one and let's also
05:16 - tell the game hammer that we need to add
05:18 - some score so now let's see if our score
05:22 - updates whenever we eat some food
05:23 - there's the snake currently got a score
05:25 - zero and if I eat this and yep there you
05:27 - go now you have a score of 100 in
05:29 - another one and 200 and 300 and so on so
05:33 - we now have a very nice UI element to
05:36 - display our current score so there you
05:38 - have it we set up the UI canvas and add
05:41 - a text field to display the current
05:42 - score in the next video we're going to
05:44 - set up loading so we can reload the game
05:46 - when we done as always you can download
05:48 - the project files in utilities from
05:50 - unity karma Keep Calm if you have any
05:52 - questions post them in the comments and
