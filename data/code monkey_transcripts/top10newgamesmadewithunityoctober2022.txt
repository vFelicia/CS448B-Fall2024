02:22 - we have a game with a really fun name
02:23 - it's Dave the diver it's a pretty fun
02:26 - mix of an action and management game
02:28 - first you capture some fish and then you
02:30 - sell some sushi during the day you dive
02:32 - into the sea to capture fish firing the
02:34 - Harpoon feels really satisfying but it's
02:37 - not just spraying there are also some
02:39 - dangerous fish that you have to find so
02:41 - you must be ready to dodge and defeat
02:43 - them then at night it's time to serve
02:45 - the fish to the customers you pour some
02:47 - drinks grab the right dish for the right
02:49 - customer do it right and you get a tip
02:51 - you can build the many yourself decide
02:53 - what dishes you want the chef to serve
02:55 - and make sure you catch enough
02:56 - ingredients that you need it looks like
02:58 - a really nice mix of genres I saw a
03:00 - spider cat play a demo build quite a
03:02 - while ago and looks pretty fun already
03:04 - has 500 overwhelmingly positive views so
03:07 - people are really enjoying this nice
03:08 - unique mix next up a game with a very
03:11 - generic name but it doesn't look awesome
03:12 - it's called weird RPG it's a fast-paced
03:16 - very difficult action game
03:17 - the main thing about it is it looks like
03:19 - the combat is excellently tight all the
03:22 - attacks look really Snappy and really
03:24 - powerful it says that it's influenced by
03:26 - Hades and sakuro those are two games
03:28 - with excellent combat and controls also
03:31 - features a multitude of weapons each
03:32 - being completely different and really
03:34 - making you feel powerful it has over a
03:36 - thousand very positive views and also if
03:38 - you're regular on this channel then you
03:40 - might be immediately recognizing the
03:41 - assets so this is yet another excellent
03:44 - example of something that I covered in
03:45 - another video which is how players
03:47 - really just want awesome games to play
03:49 - they don't care what assets you use to
03:51 - make them up next if you're looking for
03:53 - some nice Colony survival check out
03:54 - settlement survival the only the group
03:57 - of survivors in search of a new home
03:58 - take over this land and make it your own
04:01 - he can manipulate the landscape grow
04:03 - some crops and set up some trading
04:05 - routes although do remember that this is
04:07 - a survival game so make sure you have
04:09 - enough resources and you're prepared for
04:11 - all the disasters that are sure to
04:13 - happen discover some rare Blueprints and
04:15 - explore the tech tree so will you
04:17 - prioritize trading or mining agriculture
04:19 - or Logistics it's all up to you also has
04:22 - a quote-unquote fun mode where you
04:24 - relieve some historical moments like the
04:26 - bubonic play or the Easter Island
04:28 - Disaster so it seems like a really nice
04:30 - Colony Survival game it just launched a
04:33 - few days ago and already has 4 000 very
04:35 - positive reviews so this one really
04:36 - selling like crazy then here we have
04:39 - godania it's an open world RPG with tons
04:42 - of freedom you can build your character
04:44 - in any way you want so you can be a
04:46 - stealthy assassin or a powerful Mage you

04:50 - factions and explore and Conquer some
04:52 - scary dungeons you have your own house
04:55 - which you can build and decorate and you
04:57 - can also do some gardening and farm some
04:59 - animals every Quest has many ways it can
05:01 - be completed you can use Ross ranked or
05:03 - Charisma it's up to you and just like
05:05 - the other game that I mentioned a while
05:07 - ago you've probably noticed the synthes
05:09 - in this one and again it did not hurt
05:10 - the game it has 1700 very positive
05:13 - reviews so people really love the game
05:14 - then here we have lost idle ones it's a
05:17 - really cinematic turn-based RPG the
05:20 - attacks really are extremely cinematic
05:22 - there are some gorgeous camera shots
05:24 - with some really nice animations and
05:25 - effects personally I definitely need to
05:27 - study this one to see if there is
05:29 - anything I can apply to my own
05:30 - turn-based strategy game
05:32 - the combat is grid based with multiple
05:34 - units in your party each of them with
05:36 - different skills you can customize your
05:38 - squad from 20 characters and 10 unique
05:40 - classes you can train them and unlock
05:42 - new skills and spells then lace each the
05:44 - castles and take out some cutting bosses
05:46 - by thinking and executing the perfect
05:48 - strategy then for some VR here we have
05:51 - that second it looks like yet another VR
05:54 - shooter but the main thing is how it's
05:56 - really an old-school arcade shooter I
05:58 - love playing virtual cop as a kid and
06:00 - this one is pretty much exactly that so
06:02 - rather than having commonly free
06:03 - movement you can only move to
06:04 - predetermined spots doing that allows
06:07 - the game to feel much better design on
06:09 - the encounters are handmade to make you
06:11 - feel really awesome and the game itself
06:13 - is all about style so there's lots of
06:15 - slow motion some quick shots and some
06:17 - super cool moves I really love how the
06:19 - trailer for this one looks it really
06:20 - looks like it's extremely satisfying to
06:22 - play if you're in the mood for a card
06:24 - action game check out one more gate it's
06:27 - a deck building roguelite there's over
06:29 - 100 cards you can collect and use in
06:31 - your deck lots of quests to complete and
06:34 - some Quirk characters to meet
06:36 - being a roguelite means that every run
06:38 - is unique with some unexpected Powers
06:40 - Divine blessings and curses all of it
06:43 - made with a gorgeous looking art style
06:44 - some really nice clean lights and some
06:46 - gorgeous effects and animations and at
06:49 - number one for my personal pick of the
06:50 - month here is an extremely deep and
06:52 - complex sci-fi Colony Sim called Sturgis
06:55 - you run the AI of a ship with some
06:57 - hibernating humans take your Fleet of
07:00 - drones and repair the ship save the crew
07:02 - and explore the Stars it's inspired by
07:04 - both factorio and rimworld those are
07:07 - definitely two excellent sources of
07:08 - inspiration
07:09 - you need to watch out for pressure and
07:11 - otune levels if there's a leak then
07:13 - things are not going to go well there's
07:15 - tons and tons of overlays to help you
07:17 - visualize everything that is going on
07:19 - with the ship there will be disasters
07:21 - like asteroids that hit your ship and
07:23 - break the whole thing apart so it's up
07:25 - to you to quickly get the drones to work
07:27 - repairing the ship before everything
07:28 - blows up personally as someone who loves
07:30 - both factorio and rim world this one
07:32 - looks extremely awesome alright so
07:34 - that's 10 awesome new games made with
07:36 - the Indian team launched in October 22.
07:38 - I hope this list until you see how the
07:40 - unity engine is capable of building
07:41 - anything the limits are really just your
07:43 - own skills and Imagination let me know
