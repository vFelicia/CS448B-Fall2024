00:02 - hi there this is a quick tip for how to
00:04 - set the number of lines per entry in the
00:06 - console so over here I have some random
00:08 - code just doing a bunch of logs my
00:11 - warnings and a log error and here in the
00:13 - game you can see how it shows by default
00:15 - you can see each entry and the console
00:18 - right here you've got the amongst the
00:20 - warnings and the errors so each entry is
00:22 - showing the in log message and also
00:25 - where that message came from so you can
00:27 - essentially see the first line of the
00:29 - stack trace now most times you're really
00:31 - only interested in the message and don't
00:33 - really want to see these stacked rates
00:35 - for example in here starting game I
00:36 - don't care where this message came from
00:38 - since it's just an information message
00:40 - so one thing you can do is click here on
00:42 - the console options and here on the
00:45 - unlock entry you can set the number of
00:47 - lines that your log entry should have so
00:49 - for example if you do want to see the
00:51 - stack trace you can increase this by
00:52 - let's say five lines and now you can
00:54 - more easily see where the messages came
00:56 - from or you can do what I normally do
00:59 - which is go into the log entry and
01:00 - select just one line and just like that
01:02 - you have all the messages nice and
01:04 - compact which makes it very easy to read
01:06 - and if you do need to see the stack
01:08 - trace you can simply highlight a message
01:10 - and now you can see the stack trace for
01:12 - this particular message and that's it
01:15 - hope you found this tip useful
01:16 - alright see you next time
