00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code Mahi as
00:02 - you might know a while ago there was a
00:04 - Sim Festival that lasted for a week now
00:06 - I'm a bit late with this video I was
00:07 - quite safe for the past two weeks so I'm
00:09 - a bit late but but only never I
00:10 - definitely want to make sure that I make
00:12 - this video my goal with this devlog
00:13 - series is phone transparency so first
00:15 - let's look at the raw number of
00:16 - wishlists Impressions play duration and
00:18 - more then I'll give you my analysis on
00:20 - whether the festival was a success and
00:22 - in the end I'll also mention what are my
00:24 - plans with the game going forward okay
00:25 - so first for some raw numbers I believe
00:28 - this was the biggest Festival of all
00:29 - with over 1200 demos so that means quite
00:32 - a lot of competition for players in just
00:34 - one week during the festival my game
00:36 - demo was played by 1591 people and 5 300
00:40 - added it to their account it got 855
00:43 - wishlists taking it from 1550 to
00:46 - 2405. the average General play time was
00:49 - 50 minutes and the median was 13 minutes
00:51 - in terms of views during the festival
00:52 - the game got 600 000 Impressions and 11
00:55 - 000 visits during the festival I also
00:58 - did two live streams and use teams event
00:59 - future sure to promote them and show the
01:01 - live stream on the same page and I also
01:03 - constantly updated the game with 12
01:05 - updates over the course of that one week
01:06 - so those are the hard numbers now before
01:08 - I get my analysis first of all if you're
01:10 - a native Dev what exactly is a steam
01:12 - Festival in terms of indie game
01:13 - marketing steam festivals are an
01:14 - absolute must nowadays they are a great
01:17 - way to get a bunch of exposure and
01:18 - hopefully gather tons of wishlists to
01:20 - ensure you have a successful launch
01:21 - there are multiple scene festivals per
01:23 - year in order to participate in one your
01:25 - game needs to have a working demo it
01:27 - needs to have a probably coming soon
01:28 - page and importantly you can only
01:30 - participate in a single Sim Festival
01:32 - before release if you're new to indie
01:34 - game marketing I highly recommend you go
01:35 - watch my marketing video if you want to
01:37 - find success with your games and
01:38 - marketing is an absolute must nowadays
01:40 - so you must know about it okay so now
01:42 - here's my analysis on whether this was a
01:43 - success or not the answer is honestly it
01:46 - depends some parts of it went great and
01:47 - some parts not so great first for the
01:50 - positive the most positive thing was the
01:52 - responsive demo the feedback that I got
01:53 - there were obviously tons of issues
01:55 - since the demo was only in Alpha but in
01:57 - general the general concept of the game
01:58 - people did seem to enjoy it I've also
02:01 - had some publisher interest from some
02:02 - pre-series Publishers so that means the
02:04 - core game idea is solid however at the
02:06 - same time while the response has been
02:07 - very positive I have to be very careful
02:09 - about how I take that most of the people
02:11 - that play the demo I assume more people
02:13 - just like you meaning people over here
02:14 - watching this channel now I assume that
02:17 - if you're a regular viewer in this
02:18 - channel I assume that means that you
02:19 - enjoy what I do I assume that means my
02:21 - videos have been helpful to you in some
02:23 - way so that means that the feedback that
02:25 - I got is very likely biased towards the
02:27 - positive side whereas on a final release
02:29 - regular steam players have no idea who I
02:31 - am so they will not have that bias so
02:33 - personally I have to be very careful not
02:35 - to be caught up in all of this positive
02:36 - feedback and assume that it represents
02:38 - the regular steam audience because it
02:40 - might not this is the same advice that I
02:41 - would give to you whenever you ask your
02:42 - friends or in family for advice and
02:44 - feedback on your game when you do
02:46 - remember that your friends are not
02:47 - really going to be brutally honest with
02:49 - you they're always going to be a bit
02:50 - more nice than the usual so always keep
02:52 - that in mind when receiving feedback now
02:54 - speaking of the regular steam audience
02:55 - that brings me to the other side that
02:57 - didn't go quite as well and that is
02:58 - actually the numbers I was really hoping
03:00 - to get a bare minimum of a thousand
03:02 - wishlists so getting just 850 that is
03:04 - quite rough with a slow mount it makes a
03:06 - goal of launching the game with at least
03:08 - 5000 wishlists that makes that go really
03:10 - difficult to achieve I'm going to talk
03:11 - about my future plans in a little bit
03:13 - and also 1500 players playing the demo
03:16 - that is also a really small amount I do
03:18 - wonder how many of those are actually
03:19 - people over here watching this channel I
03:21 - would assuming sectional Advanced
03:22 - majority which means the demo really did
03:24 - not get any organic visibility at all
03:26 - for some context one excellent source
03:28 - that I've mentioned a few times is Chris
03:29 - zakowski from how to Market your game he
03:31 - made a real nice post with a ton of
03:33 - stats from last year's Festival in
03:35 - general the median number of wishlists
03:37 - were about 1100 and that seemed to be on
03:39 - an uptrend so getting quite a lot fewer
03:41 - than that amount is definitely not ideal
03:43 - now as to why I think the demo got
03:45 - subpar performance I think the answer is
03:47 - simply that I was way too ambitious with
03:48 - a super tight deadline on the one hand
03:50 - the massive improvements that I managed
03:52 - to do in the 12 updates that I put out
03:54 - once the game demo was live on the
03:55 - festival that was really impressive but
03:57 - on the other hand that really puts into
03:58 - perspective just how we week the very
04:00 - first build for demo ones the median
04:02 - play duration was under 9 minutes that
04:04 - is really low without the updates that
04:06 - did improve massively but that didn't
04:08 - seem to matter by that point I'm not
04:09 - entirely sure how exactly the Sim
04:11 - algorithm works for this case for scene
04:13 - festivals but perhaps launching with a
04:15 - subpar demo caused the algorithm to
04:17 - essentially ignore the demo for the rest
04:18 - of festival and that is why it did not
04:20 - get much or any organic visibility now
04:22 - an Ideal World I would obviously delete
04:24 - the demo until I had it working exactly
04:26 - as I wanted but I cannot control the
04:28 - timing for the Sim festivals if I didn't
04:29 - participate in this one then I would
04:31 - have to donate demo until all the way
04:33 - over to October so in general the
04:35 - question was he seem first of all a
04:36 - success now in terms of numbers the
04:38 - answer is no not at all but in terms of
04:40 - feedback I would say the answer is
04:41 - definitely yes the feedback was very
04:43 - positive and personally I'm still very
04:45 - confident in the game I do think the
04:46 - game is in a really great state right
04:48 - now and I'm really happy with how it's
04:49 - going I'm really excited for the future
04:51 - and for the final phone release if I can
04:53 - build everything that I have in my head
04:55 - then I do believe the final game will be
04:56 - great and now let's see what are my
04:58 - plans for the game for the future her
05:00 - honestly at this point I'm not entirely
05:01 - 100 sure the initial plan was to
05:04 - prioritize this project over the many
05:05 - other things that I would like to do if
05:07 - I focus primarily just on this project
05:09 - I'm pretty confident that I could get it
05:10 - done by some time to Mid late August I
05:13 - know that I can be extremely productive
05:14 - if I focus on one thing and one thing
05:16 - only but with the current wishlist rate
05:18 - of just about 10 wish lists per day with
05:20 - that if I were to release a game in
05:21 - about a month and a half that would mean
05:23 - really just about 300 to 500 wishlists
05:25 - so the total would be just about 3 000
05:27 - which is a very low amount launching
05:29 - with so few wishlists really makes it
05:31 - difficult for the game to find success
05:32 - regardless of quality now I'm really
05:34 - enjoying the game I do think it's in a
05:35 - great place right now I'm really
05:36 - enjoying the design and testing it so I
05:39 - do believe the game has a lot of
05:40 - potential to turn out really great so
05:42 - the question is do I launch a game with
05:43 - a low wish list amount and potentially
05:45 - risk it becoming a flop even if the game
05:47 - ends up being great or do I take a bit
05:49 - longer to gather a few more wish lists
05:51 - and hopefully launch with better numbers
05:52 - so I can find more success now I really
05:54 - really want to launch a game this year
05:56 - so unless something really drastic
05:58 - happens I am not planning to push
05:59 - generally say it anyway past something
06:01 - like October but I do have those two
06:03 - options so do I focus primarily on this
06:06 - game and work on it essentially full
06:07 - time and get it done by about mid to
06:09 - late August or do I work on it more
06:11 - part-time so kind of mixing working on
06:13 - the game with working on other projects
06:15 - like exploring dots or random tutorials
06:17 - or working on more multiplayer videos I
06:19 - could potentially make a more advanced
06:21 - multiplayer course based on all the
06:22 - things that I learned in this game and
06:24 - at the same time keep working on the
06:25 - game essentially part-time and launch
06:27 - much later on something like October so
06:29 - those are the two options and like I
06:31 - said right now I'm still not sure I'm
06:33 - trying to put myself on the other side
06:34 - of this equation if someone had this
06:36 - exact dilemma and they came to me for
06:38 - advice what would I say I think that
06:40 - what I would say would be if this is
06:41 - your first game then just go ahead and
06:43 - launch it don't wait any longer
06:44 - launching your very first game is super
06:46 - important you won't gain so much more
06:47 - knowledge and it's Helen likely to ever
06:49 - find financial success so for your first
06:51 - game you should just launch it but
06:52 - obviously that is not my case it's not
06:54 - my first game so what I would say if
06:56 - this is not your first game if you're
06:58 - going with this game is to find some
06:59 - level a financial success if so then my
07:02 - advice is if you believe the idea then
07:03 - you should keep working on it and keep
07:05 - slowly Gathering wishlists so after
07:07 - thinking like that maybe I should take
07:08 - my own hypothetical advice and do
07:10 - exactly that honestly making these
07:12 - devlog videos is hopefully interesting
07:13 - to you to see the inner workings behind
07:15 - a proper steam game but these are also
07:17 - extremely useful for me to essentially
07:19 - put my thoughts on on paper and really
07:20 - think through that really helps with
07:22 - decisions like this one so after
07:24 - spending all the time running this video
07:25 - I think I know though the answer I think
07:27 - I will keep working on this game
07:28 - part-time alongside all the other
07:30 - projects that I want to do I won't keep
07:32 - doing devlogs and experimenting with
07:33 - other formats I know some other devs
07:35 - have found tons of success on Tick Tock
07:37 - and Instagram so I'm definitely trying
07:38 - out that format I will keep doing that
07:40 - and essentially plan for release around
07:42 - October with that I should have time to
07:44 - release something like 10 to 15 devlogs
07:46 - and perhaps 20 plus shorts and with all
07:49 - those hopefully some of those will go
07:50 - semi-viral and gather tons of wish lists
07:52 - with that then hopefully that won't turn
07:54 - into a total wishlist amount that is
07:56 - really nice by October and then I can
07:57 - launch a game and hopefully the final
07:59 - game is great so it does find success so
08:01 - that's it that's my current plan alright
08:03 - so that's my results and my analysis of
08:05 - the scene Festival I hope you found this
08:07 - interesting and I hope this helps you
08:08 - when you go to participate in your own
08:10 - scene Festival now I get to get back to
08:12 - working on the game as well as many
08:13 - other projects and of course go ahead
08:15 - and add dinky hard as your wishlist and
08:16 - try out the demo alright so thanks for
08:18 - watching and I'll see you next time
08:31 - thank you
