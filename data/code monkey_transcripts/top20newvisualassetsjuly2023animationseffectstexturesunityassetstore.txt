02:39 - of variations then for a nice calm
02:41 - gorgeous looking environment here is

02:52 - some alien looking purple areas it

02:56 - of rocks and cliffs this one does packs
02:58 - where you can just use the demo scene
02:59 - directly whatever game you're working on

03:02 - and you just need some characters check
03:04 - out these medieval knights it's got a
03:06 - realistic Style with tons of much more
03:07 - parts these start with a basic human
03:09 - body and then attach Parts on top of
03:11 - those parts they're all very realistic
03:13 - although it also includes a strange gray
03:15 - skin color with red eyes so this could
03:17 - also work for some kind of medieval

03:47 - certainly around lots of interesting
03:49 - stuff very interesting animations
03:50 - looking at this one reminds me that I
03:52 - need to get a pack just like this one
03:53 - when I go to punish up the UI for my
03:55 - steam game if you're building a jrpg
03:57 - here is a character pack you've got some
03:59 - phone size character portraits and some
04:01 - small ones for in-game now it says that
04:03 - this pack is meant to be used with RPG
04:04 - Maker but these are religious images so

04:08 - your game has 3D characters and you want
04:10 - to customize how they unlock check out
04:11 - this hair pack it includes quite a lot
04:13 - of hairstyles to choose from everything

04:29 - visual style nice calm and cartoony this
04:31 - is actually from the same Dev from where
04:32 - I grab my dinkies and Zombies characters
04:34 - it's really interesting how a hexagon is
04:36 - such a basic shape but as you can see
04:38 - you can take that shape and build it in
04:40 - various ways I can see this being great
04:42 - for some kind of puzzle game or perhaps
04:44 - something like Exon which by the way my
04:46 - turn-based strategy course does have a
04:47 - free expansion that covers hex words
04:49 - then if you're making a pixel art game

05:05 - inspired by the NES it doesn't look
05:07 - exactly like you expect it's got some
05:09 - thick pixels with some nice animation
05:11 - these are all 16 by 16 pixels using the
05:13 - NES palette for some cute characters

05:19 - just characters in some sort of Animal
05:21 - Kingdom game next here's a very unique
05:23 - one paddled unique and unusual grenades
05:26 - they are certainly very very unusual

05:32 - of them for something more grounded here
05:33 - are some gears looking at this makes me
05:35 - want to make some kind of gear based
05:37 - game just the other day I was watching
05:38 - some videos on using Lego Gears to make
05:40 - lots of interesting things with this you
05:42 - could make a fun virtual version of
05:43 - exactly that or perhaps you want a hyper
05:46 - realistic medieval environment this one
05:47 - looks really gorgeous it's a castle with
05:50 - some thick walls leather Stakes trees
05:52 - and more really has an excellent look
05:53 - excellent environment and looks very
05:55 - dark and Moody the skies are cloudy and
