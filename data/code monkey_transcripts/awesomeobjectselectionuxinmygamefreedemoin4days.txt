00:00 - look at the awesome ux that I made for
00:01 - selecting objects in my game I can go up
00:03 - to an object like for example a moving
00:05 - vehicle now this requires setting the
00:06 - from and two buildings in order to work
00:08 - so I can click on this button and the
00:09 - camera zooms out and the game goes into
00:11 - a different mode where I can control a
00:12 - warm position then just checks for which
00:14 - round objects are around in this case
00:16 - it's only the container buildings so I
00:18 - can move the selector and I can select
00:19 - Which object I want I do the same thing
00:21 - for the other one and there's the moving
00:22 - vehicle quickly set up then I can also
00:24 - do the same thing over here on this
00:26 - dinky I can tell it to go interact with
00:28 - the power generator to get some power
00:29 - then I can go up to this one and tell it
00:31 - to grab power from here and drop it here
00:33 - and then go into this one to tell it to
00:35 - grab power from here and feed it onto
00:36 - machines so with all this it's super
00:38 - easy to interact with all the objects in
00:39 - the game you can go ahead and play the
00:41 - free demo on scene this Monday so stay
00:43 - tuned
