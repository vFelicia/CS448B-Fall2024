00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - so a while ago i made a video on the
00:04 - awesome cinti assets humble bundle that
00:05 - is currently running and is actually
00:07 - ending soon in that video i asked if you
00:09 - would like to see some quick mini games
00:11 - built with these assets to showcase
00:13 - various game ideas that you could make
00:14 - so lately that's what i've been building
00:16 - i took the sci-fi pack and made a really
00:18 - nice rts game
00:20 - i used the farm pack to make a nice
00:21 - farming game
00:23 - and finally i used the town pack to make
00:25 - a sort of crazy taxi driving game the
00:27 - goal with this video is to show you how
00:28 - you can take some asset pack that you
00:30 - like and you can turn some idea you have
00:32 - into reality pretty quickly and thanks
00:34 - to using some nice assets the final
00:36 - prototype actually looks pretty good as
00:38 - opposed to just using some boring cubes
00:41 - so whenever you look at an asset pack
00:42 - and you get an idea for an interesting
00:44 - game go ahead and try building it you
00:45 - might really enjoy what you make in case
00:47 - you missed that other video here is the
00:49 - humble bundle that i'm talking about
00:51 - this one's got a massive amount of cindy
00:53 - studios pack all of them in their
00:54 - gorgeous low poly style i would highly
00:56 - recommend you get this bundle you can
00:58 - get over 3 000 assets which you can then
01:00 - use in hundreds of different game ideas
01:02 - like you will see in a bit
01:04 - over here you have the ones i mentioned
01:05 - so the farm pack the sapphire space pack
01:08 - and the town pack then you also have the
01:10 - pirate pack with tons of assets if you
01:12 - got the office pack in case you want to
01:13 - make some sort of tycoon game you've got
01:15 - the prototype pack with tons of basic
01:17 - modular pieces then you've got tons and
01:19 - tons of characters
01:21 - there's a spy kit an explorer kit and
01:23 - tons and more so yep as you can see this
01:25 - bundle is excellent possibly the best
01:26 - bundle i've ever seen it's got a massive
01:28 - amount of variety for an extremely cheap
01:30 - price
01:31 - it ends in just three days so i would
01:33 - encourage you to get it quickly check it
01:34 - out with the link in the description and
01:36 - one more thing if you're the kind of
01:37 - person who does not like using assets
01:39 - because you think it's cheating or maybe
01:41 - because you're afraid that players won't
01:43 - call your game an asset flip if you
01:44 - think like that then go watch this other
01:46 - video that i made where i browse games
01:48 - that are clearly using assets and i see
01:50 - what the player reviews actually say
01:52 - okay so let's see the mini games that i
01:54 - quickly made using these assets there's
01:56 - also chapters in the video if you want
01:57 - to skip ahead i'm pretty happy with what
01:59 - i've managed to build and how good it
02:01 - looks considering how quickly i made
02:02 - these games i only spent about 4 hours
02:05 - on each game that's a pretty small
02:06 - amount of time but they still work as
02:08 - basic prototypes and thanks to using
02:10 - some awesome assets the games also look
02:12 - pretty cool
02:13 - so here is my first game this one is the
02:15 - rts minigame that i made with the sci-fi
02:17 - pack
02:18 - so i've got a bunch of units i can click
02:20 - to select them i've got a camera that i
02:22 - can move rotate around zoom in and so on
02:25 - for the selection logic i actually
02:26 - covered rts unit simulation in another
02:28 - video so i can click to select them and
02:30 - right click to tell them to go anywhere
02:32 - so all of you go over there then for the
02:35 - level it's a really nice space station
02:37 - tons of things all of them looking
02:39 - really cool
02:41 - and over here inside the ship there are
02:42 - various turrets defending it
02:44 - so i have to tell my units to get within
02:46 - range and start attacking those thirds
02:48 - so there you go the units are attacking
02:50 - and the turrets also started tagging
02:52 - so as you can see they all have health
02:54 - both the units as well as the turrets so
02:56 - these are using the health system that i
02:58 - made on the very first video on this
02:59 - channel now eventually suddenly some
03:01 - magnets die so they can't really take it
03:03 - over with just three units so like in
03:05 - any rts i need some more units so down
03:08 - here i've got a button for my build
03:09 - queue so i can click to build some more
03:11 - units now as usual they take some time
03:13 - to build and after they are built they
03:15 - spawn them out and since this map is on
03:17 - the space station they get dropped off
03:18 - with a really nice spaceship so there
03:20 - you go the spaceship comes in drops them
03:22 - off and goes away
03:24 - now i've got these units i can move them
03:25 - around
03:27 - and try to get them to invade the space
03:29 - station and take out the turrets one by
03:32 - one there you go just like that
03:34 - so as you can see this one has all the
03:36 - main features that you would expect from
03:37 - an rts it's got unit spawning it's got
03:40 - unit selection and orders there are
03:42 - attacks and weapon shooting
03:44 - there are enemies health bars and so on
03:46 - again all of this was built in just
03:48 - about four hours of development and you
03:49 - can already see a nice game idea forming
03:52 - and thanks using this asset pack they
03:54 - actually look pretty great
03:55 - if i had not used an asset pack then all
03:57 - of these characters would be boring
03:59 - cubes and level itself would be some
04:01 - boring shapes instead of a cool looking
04:03 - space station now another idea i had for
04:05 - this pack was making some sort of
04:07 - spaceship duff fighting game there's
04:09 - tons of cool ships including the pack
04:11 - but that one is not a genre that i'm
04:13 - very experienced with so since i had
04:15 - such a short amount of time to make
04:16 - these prototypes i went to the genre
04:18 - they already knew how to make but again
04:20 - another example of a completely
04:21 - different game you could build with
04:22 - these same assets or perhaps you could
04:24 - make some sort of spaceship trading game
04:27 - so moving goods between planet to planet
04:29 - or perhaps something in first person
04:31 - like doom or halo just get a character
04:33 - controller and a first person camera and
04:35 - you can walk around the demo scene so
04:37 - tons of game ideas you can build from
04:39 - this one pack and load by the way if you
04:41 - find the video helpful please hit the
04:42 - like button it's a tiny thing but it
04:44 - really does help thanks next up the
04:46 - farming game using the farm pack now
04:48 - this one was an obvious idea although
04:51 - initially i actually thought about
04:52 - making it more in the style of a
04:54 - management game i thought about having
04:55 - an overhead view and just clicking to
04:57 - place down crops
04:59 - but since the rts game already had that
05:01 - sort of view i went to something
05:02 - different so over here i've got my
05:04 - former character in third person for the
05:06 - controller i'm using the unity official
05:08 - sarnas's third person controller that
05:10 - one is a free acid and it's really
05:12 - awesome i covered it in detail in
05:13 - another video so all i did was use that
05:16 - with a character from this pack so i can
05:18 - walk around anywhere on this firmware
05:20 - now there's also some npcs just lying
05:23 - around just give a bit of life to the
05:24 - world
05:25 - as well as some animals also walking
05:27 - around now these are from another pack
05:29 - but since that pack is also low poly the
05:31 - style actually fits perfectly so i can
05:33 - move around and over here are some plots
05:35 - of land as i approach i can select each
05:38 - one individually so just by looking at
05:39 - them so i can go into this one and using
05:41 - the keyboard i can select which seat i
05:43 - want to place
05:45 - so let's say i want to place down some
05:46 - carrots
05:48 - so i just go approach i press the button
05:50 - the character drops down does a nice
05:52 - animation this one is from the crafting
05:54 - animation mega pack pretty useful pack
05:56 - that i picked up quite a long time ago
05:58 - so with that the seed has been planted
06:00 - and i can play some more so i can select
06:02 - a different one and click to play so
06:04 - place down some corn then some like a
06:07 - butternut squash then some like a
06:09 - pumpkin
06:10 - and finally some like a watermelon
06:17 - okay so all of those seeds have
06:19 - implanted
06:20 - now all it takes is just some time to
06:22 - watch as they grow
06:24 - then i also add a button to speed up the
06:26 - clock so i can press a button and
06:28 - everything speeds up
06:29 - there's also a pretty basic day night
06:31 - cycle so the sun rotates around i just
06:33 - use a simple animation on the
06:35 - directional light and just played a bit
06:36 - with the color now as time passes the
06:38 - plants grow so they keep track of their
06:40 - own growth stage there are multiple
06:42 - growth stages as you can see
06:44 - so let's just pass some more time and
06:46 - wait until they're all fully grown
06:53 - all right they're all fully grown so
06:55 - it's time to harvest so again just
06:57 - approach a pot look at it the character
06:59 - bends down there's a nice animation and
07:00 - grabs it you can see down there on my ui
07:04 - you can see i've got a sort of simple
07:05 - inventory system and they get added so i
07:07 - just picked up a carrot and over here
07:09 - picking up this pumpkin and there you go
07:12 - just pick them all up now i can just
07:13 - plant some more and keep farming more
07:15 - and more vegetables
07:16 - so you won't really see quite a lot of
07:18 - things that i can plant all of these are
07:20 - from objects from this farm pack
07:22 - now if i were to expand upon this i
07:24 - would add some sort of market so adding
07:25 - the ability to buy seeds and sell fully
07:27 - grown vegetables
07:29 - so just with that it will be an
07:30 - interesting game loop you just plant
07:32 - grow sell buy more seeds plant some more
07:34 - grow some more and so on again all of
07:37 - this was made in just about four hours
07:38 - and you can already see a nice working
07:40 - prototype and just like with the rts
07:42 - game the prototype looks great since
07:44 - it's using proper assets instead of just
07:46 - boring old cubes for some other ideas
07:48 - you could build with this pack first off
07:50 - my original idea you could make this
07:52 - sort of more like a management game so
07:54 - something with a top-down view perhaps
07:56 - controlling multiple farmer characters
07:58 - building buildings and so on
08:00 - or perhaps this could be simply a normal
08:02 - level in a normal shooter game just a
08:04 - nice farm environment
08:06 - or you could make something like farming
08:08 - simulator and add some vehicle controls
08:10 - to all the vehicles included in the pack
08:12 - once again lots of game ideas you can
08:14 - build with this pack and then for the
08:16 - final game the one using the town pack
08:18 - now my first idea for this one was
08:20 - making some like the sims so using the
08:22 - interior of a house and controlling
08:24 - various characters to do normal actions
08:26 - that was my first idea but that required
08:28 - quite a lot of animations which given
08:30 - how much time i had to build a prototype
08:31 - would be quite tricky so i looked at the
08:34 - pack and saw that it had some nice cars
08:35 - so i decided to use the demo scene and
08:37 - make something sort of like crazy taxi
08:39 - for the car controls i made a super
08:41 - simple controller in another video but
08:43 - that one is extremely simple
08:45 - then i also remember that i had a
08:47 - driving asset that i picked up quite a
08:48 - long time ago
08:50 - so this was the perfect time to use that
08:52 - it just took a bit of time to look into
08:54 - how that asset works just change the
08:56 - visual for the one from this pack i
08:58 - tweaked some settings to make the
08:59 - driving feel nice and arcading and with
09:01 - that over here is my car so i can drive
09:04 - around i can even go and do some nice
09:06 - moves
09:08 - the town itself also looks pretty great
09:11 - so lots of buildings lots of variety and
09:13 - lots of things
09:18 - i also made a bunch of people walking
09:20 - around now for the movement i actually
09:22 - use the super useful spine class from a
09:24 - previous video i used it to design the
09:26 - wall path just to have these people
09:28 - walking around just give the world a bit
09:30 - more life
09:32 - now the game itself is a taxi game so
09:34 - randomly there are some people waiting
09:36 - to be packed up and above the car is a
09:38 - nice gps arrow pointing me to where i
09:40 - need to go
09:41 - so over there is a person waiting for a
09:43 - ride so i get there i stop at the point
09:46 - okay now i need to go into the
09:47 - destination so i gotta move my car
09:49 - around gotta go somewhere to the right
09:51 - side
09:59 - and yep there you go i've delivered that
10:01 - one so now with that one now i've got
10:03 - another one so i gotta go once again
10:04 - follow the arrows and try to find the
10:06 - next spot
10:09 - here there's another one just waiting
10:11 - for a pickup
10:12 - and i gotta go and go into the target
10:15 - also up there on top you can see a nice
10:17 - timer so the time is calculated between
10:19 - the pickup and the drop-off and there
10:21 - you go drop them off alright nice so
10:24 - once again another basic but
10:25 - pre-functional working prototype as for
10:28 - some other game ideas you could build
10:29 - with this pack now if i had some more
10:31 - time i would have known that seems like
10:32 - idea i think that one could be fun
10:35 - alternatively you could do something
10:36 - like a newspaper delivery mini game just
10:39 - wrap around go through all the houses
10:40 - and deliver some newspaper or of course
10:43 - since this one is named tom pack you
10:44 - could use it to make a city builder you
10:46 - could place down houses and roads
10:48 - or since a pack also includes a bunch of
10:50 - cars maybe you could make some sort of
10:52 - traffic simulator game or perhaps a
10:54 - while ago the cintiq city pack was also
10:57 - part of a free deal on the essasor if
10:59 - you pick that one up then you can easily
11:01 - integrate this pack onto that one to
11:03 - give you even more possible game ideas
11:05 - so as you can see i built a really nice
11:07 - rts then i made a pretty interesting
11:10 - farming game and finally a fun taxi
11:13 - driver game all three mini games were
11:15 - built pretty quickly in just a few hours
11:17 - and all three look pretty great thanks
11:19 - to using some assets
11:20 - i hope this video helped show you how
11:22 - quickly you can make some great
11:23 - prototypes so whenever you have some new
11:26 - idea possibly when you see a random
11:27 - asset pack maybe take some time to
11:29 - explore that idea and bring it to life
11:32 - also another benefit of using some good
11:34 - looking proper assets if you're someone
11:36 - who has problems with motivation
11:38 - problems with sticking with a project
11:39 - for more than a few hours
11:41 - if you're like that then having some
11:42 - proper assets can really help boost your
11:44 - motivation it's easier to stay motivated
11:47 - if your prototype actually looks great
11:48 - as opposed to just some boring cubes so
11:50 - definitely check out the humble bundle
11:52 - with all these packs and many more it
11:54 - ends really soon so definitely get it
11:56 - quickly this one is a really excellent
11:58 - bundle it's the best discount you'll
12:00 - ever get with this much variety so check
12:02 - it out with a link description
12:04 - all right hope that's useful check out
12:05 - these videos to learn some more thanks
