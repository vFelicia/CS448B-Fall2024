00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code Mon and
00:02 - in this video I'm going to cover why you
00:03 - should or shouldn't create a game design
00:06 - document let's
00:10 - begin okay so should you take time to
00:13 - create a game design document or is it a
00:15 - complete waste of time this is an
00:17 - interesting subject and different people
00:18 - will take on different views a game
00:21 - design document is essentially a
00:22 - blueprint of your final game it can be
00:24 - very simple with is a high level
00:26 - overview of the entire game or it can
00:28 - describe every single system and item
00:30 - and skill in the game in excruciating
00:33 - detail essentially you can go as simple
00:35 - or as detailed as you want the benefit
00:38 - of a highly detailed design document is
00:41 - that essentially you do all design work
00:43 - and then you do all the implementation
00:45 - this helps you separate completely
00:47 - between pre-production and actual
00:49 - production so as you're implementing
00:51 - Your Design you don't need to think
00:52 - about how it will work you just follow
00:54 - the blueprint and be confident that at
00:56 - the end you will have a good
00:58 - game in in a highly detailed design
01:01 - document you would have something like a
01:03 - list of all the enemies how they look
01:05 - where they spawned how their AI Works
01:08 - how much health and what weaknesses they
01:10 - have what weapons they hold and so on
01:13 - for a weapon you would Define the name
01:15 - the look how much damage it deals and
01:17 - how it fires maybe Define a type of ammo
01:19 - and what type of damage it does and so
01:21 - on so at the extreme point you end up
01:24 - with a huge document hundreds of pages
01:25 - long that supposedly works great as a
01:28 - game when you play it in your mind
01:31 - however for me making my small oneman
01:33 - indie games I have never had much use
01:35 - for a super detailed game design
01:37 - document a very detailed document
01:40 - essentially works against iteration if
01:42 - you have 50 pages of highly detailed
01:44 - systems you can become a bit uneasy over
01:46 - making changes even if you can clearly
01:48 - tell that the current design is not
01:50 - working so I find that the answer to the
01:53 - question of is a game design document a
01:55 - waste of time is mostly dependent on
01:57 - scale if you have a AAA game that
01:59 - involves involves 300 people working
02:01 - towards the same goal then yes you need
02:03 - every step of the way to be clearly
02:05 - detailed so everything comes together in
02:06 - the
02:07 - end in such a large project you really
02:10 - cannot have someone just randomly try
02:12 - implementing a completely different
02:13 - system and break everything for everyone
02:16 - else however if you're like me working
02:18 - Solo or even as a small team I wouldn't
02:21 - lean against going for something super
02:22 - detailed you should still have some sort
02:25 - of document that contains a high level
02:26 - view of the essence of the game in my
02:28 - case I normally have have lots of pages
02:30 - with Concepts that define an overview of
02:32 - what I'm trying to
02:34 - achieve I do most of my design as I go
02:36 - along iterating on what I create with
02:39 - only a very high level overview being
02:41 - done before I start production of a
02:42 - simple
02:44 - prototype for example when I was working
02:46 - on what would later become blueprint
02:48 - Tycoon my first thought was a game where
02:50 - you're building weapons to supply an
02:52 - army it was intended to be some sort of
02:55 - a mercenary supplier management game the
02:57 - code name for the game was actually the
02:59 - Army supplier
03:00 - wi so the player would get a contract
03:03 - from someone that needed let's say 100
03:04 - swords of a specific type made of a
03:06 - specific material then the player would
03:09 - craft the final item and deliver it to
03:10 - complete the
03:11 - contract however as I iterated on the
03:14 - simple prototype I figured out that the
03:16 - best part of the design was gathering
03:17 - the raw materials then turning them into
03:20 - something else and then another thing
03:21 - and so on and so
03:23 - on so the player need to gather a base
03:25 - material like iron turn it into a sword
03:28 - much like the supply chain from settlers
03:30 - or
03:31 - ano as I went deeper into the object
03:34 - Tech Tree I decided that keeping the
03:35 - mercenary theme would limit how far I
03:37 - could go since with that theme at the
03:40 - end I need to have some sort of weapon
03:41 - or
03:42 - armor so as I iterated on design I
03:45 - scrapped the mercenary theme and made it
03:47 - more focused on getting contracts for
03:49 - specific products and figuring out how
03:51 - to make those products in making the
03:54 - various products I expanded heavily into
03:56 - how each one was made which made me go
03:58 - deeper into the blueprint concept where
04:00 - you have inputs and outputs which then
04:01 - lead to the final game with the name
04:03 - blueprint
04:04 - Tycoon so again for my specific process
04:07 - I prefer to keep it loose and iterate on
04:09 - design as I go along however such a
04:12 - loose design would be tough to work with
04:14 - other people since I don't know exactly
04:16 - what steps I'm going to do in order to
04:17 - reach my final goal one way to keep it
04:20 - somewhat loose but also focused is to
04:22 - Define some pillars that make up the
04:23 - foundation of what you're trying to
04:25 - achieve so for example let's say you're
04:28 - making a stealth game and you Define as
04:30 - one of your pillars that the player is
04:32 - weak and direct confrontation is
04:34 - discouraged however then you go through
04:36 - implementing your design and you figure
04:38 - out that one of the abilities you design
04:40 - caused the player to be very strong in
04:41 - direct
04:43 - confrontation it was not the intent of
04:45 - the original design but the end result
04:47 - is
04:48 - that so if you had an item that was a
04:51 - smoke bomb that made enemies blind and
04:53 - you're going with this item would be for
04:54 - the player to use it to get away but
04:56 - then you also give the player a takedown
04:58 - ability that could kill enemy all of a
05:00 - sudden the best way for the player to
05:02 - play would be to throw the smoke grenade
05:04 - as an offensive tool approach the enemy
05:06 - while he's blind and kill it so just
05:08 - like that two separate abilities in your
05:10 - base design would combine into something
05:12 - that would easily break one of your
05:14 - pillars so again by using those pillars
05:17 - to guide you you could iterate on that
05:19 - design and change it so that for example
05:21 - the smoke grenade makes them blind
05:23 - except when the player is too close at
05:25 - that point the smoke grenade would once
05:27 - again be back to being a defensive tool
05:29 - inside of a offensive tool so that's an
05:32 - example of something that you would not
05:33 - necessarily think of during
05:35 - pre-production while you were writing
05:36 - your game design document but it would
05:38 - end up destroying your final game if you
05:41 - were following a strict game design
05:42 - document that prevent you from iterating
05:44 - upon it you would end up with a worse
05:47 - game so a game design document like so
05:49 - many other things is mostly a tool if it
05:52 - fits with your workflow and your team
05:54 - then sure go for it how detailed you go
05:57 - is also a variable thing start staring a
05:59 - game completely blind with no idea as to
06:01 - what the final game will be isn't very
06:03 - helpful and on the other hand having a
06:06 - 100 page straight design document that
06:08 - leaves no room for iteration also isn't
06:10 - very helpful so figure out what works
06:12 - for you and your team in order to figure
06:15 - out what works best you can start off
06:16 - with a similar project make a small one-
06:19 - month game and try doing a game design
06:21 - document before you start production if
06:23 - you find that you design too many
06:24 - specific constraints then you know the
06:26 - next time you should be a bit more loose
06:27 - with your design so there you have it
06:30 - some food for thought for you to
06:31 - consider if you should write a game
06:32 - designed document and if so how detailed
06:35 - it should be if you have any questions
06:37 - post them in the comments and I'll do my
06:38 - best to answer them subscribe for more
06:40 - videos and I'll see you next
06:52 - time
