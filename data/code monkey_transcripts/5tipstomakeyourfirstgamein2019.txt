00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - in this video I'm going to give you five
00:03 - tips to make your first game in 2019
00:05 - let's begin
00:09 - tip number one keep your scope small
00:11 - this is the most important tip design
00:14 - something you can make in a month and
00:16 - then cut it in half most people make the
00:18 - mistake of thinking too big and wanting
00:20 - to make something like GTA or Skyrim or
00:22 - a massive MMO for their first game and
00:24 - eventually end up with nothing and when
00:26 - I say most people I mean me as well when
00:29 - I first started developing flash games I
00:30 - decided my third game would be an
00:32 - open-world MMO about cops and robbers
00:34 - obviously after three months of
00:36 - development and realizing I didn't have
00:38 - the skills to pull it off I canceled
00:39 - that project so all of this to say that
00:42 - if you fall into this trap don't feel
00:43 - too bad since it happens to everyone but
00:46 - do try to avoid it so think of this
00:48 - simplest game you can do and then make
00:50 - it even simpler if you are a complete
00:52 - beginner then I would suggest you start
00:54 - off making a clone of a classi game so
00:56 - do a clone of space invaders or pac-man
00:58 - or arkanoid starting with a clone makes
01:01 - it easier to become familiar with the
01:03 - tools of the engine you choose whilst
01:04 - not having to spend too long thinking
01:06 - about the game's design then when you do
01:09 - have a clone completed you can expand
01:10 - upon it for example if you made a clone
01:13 - of space invaders think of what new
01:15 - weapon types would fit into the game
01:16 - what different enemy types would make
01:18 - the game more engaging or what different
01:20 - game modes you could have tip number two
01:22 - know your strengths it's important to
01:25 - know what you're good at when deciding
01:26 - what you want to create so if your
01:28 - strong point is art then you should try
01:30 - making an action or an adventure game go
01:33 - for something that is mechanically
01:34 - simple to implement like a platformer or
01:37 - a point-and-click and make your art
01:38 - really stand out on the other hand if
01:41 - your strong point is programming then
01:43 - maybe try doing a simple simulation or
01:45 - strategy game with a very simple art
01:47 - style something with interesting systems
01:50 - or involving multiple simple units while
01:52 - keeping the art as minimalist as
01:54 - possible improving on your weak points
01:56 - is certainly a good thing but if the
01:58 - goal is to take a project from start to
02:00 - finish then make sure you focus on your
02:02 - strengths tip number three look for help
02:04 - if there's a mechanic you really want to
02:07 - make but I have no idea how to do it
02:08 - don't look for an answer
02:10 - learning how to Google effectively is
02:12 - when the best
02:13 - you can have as a game developer there
02:15 - are lots of tutorials on the internet
02:17 - and on YouTube that won't teach you
02:18 - anything you need to know as long as you
02:20 - know what to search for so if you do get
02:22 - stuck on a problem instead of banging
02:24 - your head against it don't look online
02:25 - for someone who might have solved it
02:27 - before chances are you will find an
02:29 - answer for your problem tip number four
02:31 - be consistent creating a game is a
02:34 - marathon not a sprint it takes many
02:37 - hours to create a compelling interactive
02:39 - system where all the pieces come
02:40 - together into a great experience don't
02:42 - go too fast and burn yourself out and
02:44 - don't assume you can get it all done in
02:47 - just three days instead think it slow
02:49 - make it part of your routine and every
02:51 - day move one step closer to your goal it
02:53 - is much easier to keep going little by
02:55 - little each day then it is to burn out
02:57 - and drop everything for a week and then
02:59 - try to come back to it keep it to do
03:01 - list of all the tasks and features that
03:03 - need to be implemented so when it's time
03:05 - to work you know exactly what you're
03:06 - going to do and finally tip number five
03:09 - be happy with what you made if you go
03:12 - through the process of making a game
03:13 - from start to finish be happy with what
03:15 - you have created most people start and
03:18 - give up in the middle so just by making
03:20 - it to the end you won't be better off
03:21 - than most your first game will certainly
03:24 - not be a masterpiece so don't be upset
03:26 - if it doesn't match with the games
03:27 - you're used to playing making games is a
03:30 - skill and very much dependent on
03:31 - experience the more games you make the
03:33 - better they will be the more times you
03:35 - go through the process of start to
03:37 - finish the better you become at
03:38 - understanding what works and what
03:40 - doesn't you'll learn how to make your
03:42 - game design more engaging your character
03:44 - is better drawn and animated and your
03:46 - code cleaner and more efficient remember
03:49 - each game is a marathon and your skills
03:51 - as game developer are a marathon of
03:53 - multiple marathons so again out of all
03:56 - of these the most important one is keep
03:57 - your scope small you won't gain ten
03:59 - times more knowledge and experience by
04:01 - going through the entire process from
04:02 - start to finish rather than starting
04:04 - something and living it halfway making a
04:06 - game involves many unique elements all
04:08 - coming together into one final product
04:10 - so if you're just doing prototype after
04:12 - prototype you'll never actually learn
04:14 - how to deal with things like player
04:16 - progression game flow level balancing
04:18 - game juice or even things like doing a
04:20 - main menu in true or saving and loading
04:22 - those are all part of the process of
04:24 - making a complete game so there
