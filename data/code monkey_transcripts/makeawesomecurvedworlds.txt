00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:01 - and here let's check out a really cool
00:03 - asset called curved worlds this is an
00:06 - awesome looking effect that can really
00:07 - make your game stand out this video is
00:09 - played into two parts first let's look
00:11 - at some of the demos to see what the
00:12 - asset can do and how they work then
00:14 - after that i'll do a quick step-by-step
00:16 - guide on how to start using it and add
00:17 - it to your own games check out the
00:19 - entire asset review playlist where i
00:20 - highlight great assets to help you make
00:22 - your games awesome and as always there's
00:24 - a link to the asset in the description
00:26 - and as a bonus you can use the coupon
00:27 - code monkey10 to get 10 off your order
00:30 - this one is also part of the amazing
00:31 - shaders bundle it adds an extra 30 off
00:34 - if you're also interested in the other
00:35 - assets so curved worlds like the name
00:37 - implies this helps you create curved
00:39 - worlds and by curved it means that it
00:41 - can curve in pretty much any way that
00:42 - you can imagine so you can do something
00:45 - subtle like for example the animal
00:47 - crossing effect where you have just a
00:48 - slight blend or you can do the inverse
00:50 - of that and do a sort of inception-like
00:53 - bending of the world or you can push it
00:55 - to the limit and end up with a
00:56 - completely circular world or you can
00:58 - make some really weird twisty corridors
01:00 - it's an extremely flexible and adaptable
01:02 - effect so here i've got my project and i
01:05 - imported the package now the package
01:07 - that you import from the asset store
01:09 - just contains the installers for the
01:10 - various pipelines
01:12 - it supports the built-in hdrp and
01:14 - universal so in my case i then opened up
01:17 - the universal pipeline package after you
01:19 - install it if you see some shader errors
01:22 - make sure you're using the correct
01:23 - version shown in the manual so at the
01:25 - time of this recording the minimums are
01:27 - unity 2019.4 and universal 7.4.1 so
01:31 - that's what i'm using over here in my
01:32 - project now as with many assets this one
01:34 - comes with some really good
01:36 - documentation so you've got a pdf manual
01:38 - with just about everything you can
01:40 - imagine it's got tons of tutorials so
01:42 - you can understand how it works and how
01:44 - to get it looking exactly as you want it
01:46 - now we're going to see the manual in
01:47 - more detail in a little bit and another
01:49 - thing it includes is also tons of
01:51 - example scenes so if we expand this
01:53 - there you go tons of examples some of
01:55 - them are complete examples and some of
01:56 - them are starting tutorials so let's
01:59 - first see the complete demos and then
02:00 - afterwards we're going to try to follow
02:01 - some of the tutorials now the first demo
02:03 - over here the bend classic runner this
02:06 - is the most basic example it's
02:07 - essentially just a runner game so you've
02:09 - got a car constantly moving forward and
02:11 - some more cars coming in so a very basic
02:14 - demo and then up here you see two
02:16 - separate sliders and by moving them you
02:18 - suddenly start seeing the effect in
02:20 - action so if you take them to the limits
02:22 - then you can all of a sudden see just
02:23 - how much this effect changes and you can
02:25 - also pause the game and look at the
02:27 - scene view to see how the effect
02:28 - actually works so here in the scene view
02:30 - you see there goes the road and goes
02:32 - down into the right here you can also
02:34 - see a key point for how the effect
02:36 - actually works which is if i select one
02:38 - of these objects and let's say something
02:39 - like this one and there you go the
02:41 - transform is positioned all the way up
02:42 - here so essentially all of this business
02:45 - that you see is simply the visual in
02:46 - terms of object positions the objects
02:48 - are all up here so if i select them all
02:51 - you can see all the colliders everything
02:52 - is up here it's only the visuals that go
02:54 - down there so in technical terms this is
02:57 - a vertex transformation shader it takes
02:59 - the visuals and positions them
03:00 - differently depending on the distance to
03:02 - the camera so logic for this minigame is
03:04 - super simple you've got some chunks with
03:06 - some cars that spawn at the end and they
03:08 - simply move backwards and then all of
03:10 - the weird shapes that you see are just
03:11 - based on the visuals so this is awesome
03:13 - because means that your logic can stay
03:15 - relatively simple so on the logic for
03:17 - this minigame is all just very basic so
03:19 - you don't need to worry about
03:20 - positioning your transforms in any weird
03:22 - positions you build your game like
03:24 - normal and then apply the effect on top
03:26 - so for example you can use normal
03:27 - navmesh pathfinding since the collectors
03:29 - are all the way up here placed exactly
03:31 - as normal separate from the visuals and
03:33 - if i move the missions you can see yep
03:34 - everything changes and it's the same
03:36 - thing for all the physics animation and
03:38 - so on none of this is affected by the
03:39 - actual visual you can grab one of these
03:41 - objects and move them around to see how
03:43 - the visual changes depending on the
03:44 - position to the camera by the way if you
03:46 - find the video helpful please hit the
03:47 - like button it's a tiny thing but it
03:49 - really does help thanks so here's
03:51 - another demo and this one is curving on
03:52 - the zed
03:54 - which again we can play around with just
03:55 - how much we want to carve so something
03:57 - really subtle or something really
03:59 - extreme and again this demo showcases
04:01 - how the logic does not change
04:02 - so if i fire some bullets it looks like
04:04 - they have a huge curvature but again
04:06 - over here we can see that's just the
04:08 - visual so here is a shell and if i
04:11 - resume the game there you go it goes
04:13 - forward so it does not curve all the way
04:15 - down there then this is an example on a
04:17 - 2d game so it's a standard platformer
04:19 - and adds some curvature and now it
04:21 - mostly is being played on the cylinder
04:23 - and then this demo which i think is the
04:25 - coolest effect so like this just a
04:26 - normal top-down game
04:28 - now let's add some curvature and there
04:30 - you go now we are inside a mini planet
04:32 - so this essentially just applying the
04:34 - curvature on every single axis so you
04:36 - end up with a cute little tiny planet
04:38 - it's really fun to look at and if we
04:40 - pause and if there we see the extreme
04:42 - distortion placed on the visuals but on
04:44 - the camera view yep it all looks great
04:46 - then here's a very strange demo so
04:49 - without the effect it's just a boring
04:50 - old road nothing special now let's add a
04:53 - spiral and there you go the road starts
04:55 - rotating and making a spiral and same
04:57 - thing on this side also rotates spiral
04:59 - and so on so it spirals one way and
05:01 - sparrows another way and this effect is
05:03 - also completely dynamic so in this case
05:05 - it is moved by pivot point transforms
05:07 - over here on scene view so if i move
05:08 - them around you can see yep how the
05:10 - effect changes so it's really
05:12 - interesting then here's another
05:13 - interesting one just two basic roads
05:15 - then apply some spiral distortion and
05:17 - there you go without very strange then
05:19 - you've got this really weird twisty
05:20 - corner you can curve massively one way
05:23 - or another way apply some horizontal
05:25 - twisting or some vertical twisting then
05:27 - this one showcases some very weird
05:29 - highway hills and finally this one with
05:31 - some very strange road spirals so you
05:34 - can see how these demos showcase lots of
05:35 - interesting effects that you can create
05:37 - but there's also two more demos here
05:39 - that showcase another thing you can do
05:40 - with this asset as you saw in all those
05:42 - demos those are just visuals the objects
05:45 - never actually move but you can also
05:47 - apply a script to those objects if you
05:49 - do want them to move the transform based
05:50 - on the visual position so in this one
05:52 - like it says here the red meshes are
05:54 - standard so they are just moving the
05:55 - visual so the objects themselves are
05:57 - placed all the way up here
05:59 - however on the blue ones they are
06:00 - actually being positioned where the
06:01 - visual is and again this is all dynamic
06:03 - so i can move this around and see the
06:05 - difference so here on the scene view we
06:07 - can actually see the difference if i
06:08 - select all the red ones yep they're all
06:10 - up here however all the blue ones there
06:12 - you go they go alongside the curvature
06:14 - and again all dynamics so if i move them
06:16 - they are correctly moving
06:17 - and you can select one of them to see if
06:19 - there you go with the script so the
06:21 - position and rotation is all being
06:23 - handled just by placing this so this is
06:25 - very useful if for example you want to
06:27 - use the mouse to click on one of these
06:29 - objects if you just move the visual
06:31 - anywhere to click for example on this
06:32 - red thing it would actually not select
06:34 - it because the collateral is not
06:36 - positioned here but rather all the way
06:37 - up here so to solve that you just have
06:39 - that so that when i click here the
06:40 - collider is actually indeed in here
06:42 - another thing that it does is it also
06:44 - fixes distortion so you can see these
06:46 - objects are relatively tall
06:48 - and you can see the red one over here as
06:50 - you can see up there it's quite a bit
06:52 - stretched and looks good on the bottom
06:53 - but on the top it is clearly stretch
06:56 - whereas on the blue one since the whole
06:57 - object is moved instead of just the
06:59 - visual as you can see there's no
07:00 - distortion and then the final demo takes
07:02 - it one step further
07:04 - so the red meshes they're all normal
07:06 - they're being moved just by the visual
07:07 - then the blue ones have the script so
07:09 - they get positioned and finally the
07:11 - green ones the visual is moved using the
07:13 - shader but the child game object
07:15 - containing the collider is moving
07:16 - according to the script then you've got
07:18 - a bunch of lights which are also a bit
07:19 - of a mix so some of the channel game
07:22 - objects are moving according to the
07:23 - script others are just a visual looking
07:25 - over here we can see everything in
07:26 - action if i select all the objects if
07:28 - there you go look that all of the lights
07:30 - are placed up here but then also some
07:32 - objects are placed all the way down here
07:34 - there you go look at that collateral
07:35 - it's down there so you can see how you
07:37 - have tons of control over whether you
07:39 - just want the visual to move or the
07:41 - entire object or just parts of an object
07:43 - so now that we've seen the demos let's
07:44 - see how we can use it to add it to a
07:46 - game the asset comes with some really
07:48 - useful tutorials so let's load it up
07:50 - tutorial one and right now this is just
07:53 - a normal game so there's no bending
07:54 - anywhere it's just a basic endless
07:56 - runner so the car is here i can move
07:58 - left and right there are cars being
07:59 - spawned roads and so on so so far it's
08:01 - just a basic game nothing in here is
08:02 - related to the curved ones asset then
08:04 - all of the instructions are up here on
08:06 - the manual so let's follow them and see
08:08 - what we need to do
08:10 - now as i mentioned this is a shooter
08:12 - effect which means that our objects need
08:14 - to be using that shader and right now
08:16 - everything is set up using the standard
08:17 - urp shader so that's why you didn't see
08:19 - any bending now in this demo here in the
08:21 - hierarchy we can see a correspondent in
08:23 - a chunk spanner this is what constantly
08:24 - spawns those objects so for example we
08:27 - go into the car and over here we've got
08:28 - the various cars that get spawned and
08:30 - for example over here we see a car it's
08:32 - using this material which down here we
08:33 - can see that it's using the basic urp
08:35 - lit now what we need to do is
08:37 - essentially change it so go in here go
08:39 - inside amazing assets then inside curved
08:42 - world and finally choose lit alright so
08:44 - that's it now we can do this one by one
08:47 - which would be quite a lot of work or we
08:49 - can use the super useful tool so just go
08:51 - up here into window then amazing assets
08:53 - and open up the curved window and then
08:55 - up here we can go into the renderer's
08:57 - overview and now this shows a list of
08:59 - all of the renderers present in this
09:01 - scene and all the materials that they
09:02 - are using so right now you can see that
09:04 - i changed one this one to use the curved
09:06 - wallet but we still got eight of them
09:08 - using the standard urp inlet now i can
09:11 - just go up here click on change go into
09:12 - amazing assets curved world and swap
09:14 - into lit and there you go now all of
09:16 - them are correctly using that shader so
09:18 - now we can select any of these just to
09:20 - verify selected and yep there you go it
09:22 - is using that shader now another thing
09:24 - about the shader is up here you see this
09:27 - so you've got a bend type and a bend id
09:30 - now the vent type is the type of
09:31 - algorithm that won't be applied so in
09:33 - this case we want to bend the road and
09:35 - all of the objects along the x-axis
09:38 - and then the id is just in case we want
09:39 - to have multiple variations so with this
09:41 - example let's leave it like this so
09:43 - classic runner x positive and with the
09:44 - band id of one now just by applying that
09:47 - we don't see any difference so right now
09:49 - everything still looks exactly the same
09:51 - in order to change the parameters for
09:53 - the shader we need to use a script so
09:55 - this tutorial already comes over here
09:57 - with the game object name curved on
09:58 - controller so let's go into this one
10:00 - then we go into add component and then
10:02 - go into amazing assets curved world and
10:05 - add a controller now over here we can
10:07 - choose the bend type so again classic
10:09 - runner x positive the bend id the same
10:11 - thing just one and then over here we've
10:13 - got the settings that we can use so
10:14 - here's the game looking normal now if i
10:16 - modify the size on the horizontal there
10:18 - you go it starts rotating to the right
10:19 - and rotating to the left same thing for
10:21 - a vertical up or down then you can also
10:23 - play around the offset to make the
10:24 - effect only show up a bit in there so
10:26 - there you go look at that very
10:28 - interesting so you can see how this is
10:29 - super easy to add we just use the
10:31 - included tool to change all of the
10:33 - materials in the scene then we add this
10:35 - script and that's it now here we can
10:36 - play around these values to get the
10:38 - exact look that we're looking for now if
10:40 - you want to use a different effect you
10:41 - just have to select a different bin type
10:43 - in the material so again you can do it
10:45 - manually or go again into our very nice
10:47 - tool
10:48 - here on the renderers just go on to this
10:50 - button click here then change curved
10:52 - worm then settings then let's say
10:54 - instead of classic runner x positive
10:56 - let's go with a twisted spiral then hit
10:58 - on change and this will change all the
11:01 - materials and now up here in our curved
11:03 - world controller let's go select the
11:04 - same thing and there you go now we've
11:06 - got these parameters and we move them
11:08 - and there you go look at that now we've
11:09 - got a completely different effect so as
11:11 - you can see this is super simple to add
11:13 - and if you want to take it even further
11:14 - you can the manual is extremely detailed
11:17 - and it's full of information for how you
11:19 - can build upon this if you want to
11:21 - extend upon this with some custom
11:22 - shaders you can do that so you can make
11:24 - them handwritten if you know how to
11:26 - write code or another thing it includes
11:28 - are also shadow graphs it works with
11:30 - both the unity shadow graph as well as
11:32 - the amplify shader you just go into the
11:34 - window and over here on manage you've
11:36 - got these two buttons so create a sub
11:38 - shader with vertex or vertex plus normal
11:41 - as soon as you click on it if there you
11:43 - go now here i've got that and you can
11:45 - open it and there you go here is a sub
11:47 - shader with an input and output so here
11:50 - i've got an empty custom shader and i
11:51 - can just drag this one and this works as
11:53 - a sub graph so you've got an input and
11:55 - an output and you can add anything else
11:57 - you wanted so you can combine this
11:58 - effect with any custom shaders that you
12:00 - already have again the manual is really
12:02 - good so check it out to see all the ways
12:03 - that you can expand upon this alright so
12:05 - that's curved worlds nowadays if you
12:07 - want to find success with your games it
12:09 - really needs to visually stand out using
12:11 - one of the many effects in this asset is
12:13 - one way that you can achieve that try
12:15 - playing around with everything it can do
12:16 - to make your game have a really very
12:18 - unique look as always there's a link to
