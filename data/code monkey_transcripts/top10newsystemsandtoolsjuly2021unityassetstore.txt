00:09 - that were released in june 2021

00:14 - tools in the last video i already
00:15 - covered on the best free new assets so
00:17 - go watch that if you haven't seen it
00:19 - and in the next video i will be covering
00:20 - the top assets and effects
00:22 - let me know which one of these you're
00:23 - most interested in and i might do a
00:25 - detailed review on it
00:26 - as always there's links to the assets in
00:28 - the description and as a bonus you can
00:29 - use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10

00:39 - and tons of icons
00:40 - and another bundle with a massive amount
00:42 - of music and sound effects
00:44 - both of them won really deep discounts i
00:45 - bought both of them myself
00:47 - they're ending very soon so check them
00:48 - out quickly those are also affiliate
00:50 - links so if you use them you get some
00:51 - awesome stuff
00:52 - and you help support the channel oh and
00:53 - as usual the asset store summer sale is
00:55 - continuing with new deals every week
00:57 - alright so let's go starting off with
00:59 - the sv anti-cheat
01:01 - now normally when someone asks me what
01:02 - they should do with regards to cheating
01:04 - i normally say just don't bother
01:06 - if someone wants to cheat in their own
01:08 - single player game then my approach is
01:10 - really just let them
01:11 - but if you really want to try to stop
01:13 - them then maybe pick up an asset like
01:14 - this one instead of trying to handle the
01:16 - security yourself
01:17 - this is a solution for encrypting the
01:19 - variables in ram so they are protected
01:21 - from scanners like cheat engine
01:23 - it's super easy to use all you really
01:25 - need to do is just replace the base
01:26 - types for one of these special types
01:28 - so instead of using a basic end you use
01:31 - a secure end
01:32 - also keep in mind this tool is for
01:34 - securing memory so this has nothing to
01:36 - do with multiplayer cheat prevention
01:38 - then if you need a low poly terrain tool
01:40 - here is a great one
01:41 - it just came out and it's already got
01:43 - tons of five star reviews
01:45 - it's got tons and tons of features
01:46 - easily creates some gorgeous looking
01:48 - massive
01:49 - low poly terrains it supports all of the
01:51 - render pipelines
01:53 - has support for the burst compiler and
01:55 - the job system so it's extremely fast
01:57 - with some instant real-time results
01:59 - also very performant so you can also use
02:01 - it in vr it's compatible with a bunch of
02:03 - other tools you might already have
02:05 - like the world streamer or the
02:06 - vegetation studio pro
02:08 - comes with a bunch of simple assets so
02:10 - some trees grass structures vehicles and
02:12 - so on
02:13 - it really is a massive very capable and
02:15 - very well-known tomb
02:17 - so if you want to make some low-poly
02:18 - terrains then check this one out
02:20 - then for something really interesting
02:21 - the magic light map switcher
02:23 - it's a tool for dynamically swapping out
02:26 - light maps and light probes in real time
02:28 - meaning that you can pre-bake some
02:30 - insanely high quality lighting
02:32 - and then change it during runtime to
02:33 - match some sort of time of day setting
02:36 - making a day night cycle is something
02:37 - i've been meaning to explore for quite a
02:39 - while
02:39 - and the biggest downside with what i had
02:41 - in mind was that the lighting had to be
02:43 - in real time
02:44 - but with something like this i can use
02:45 - some super high quality baked lighting
02:47 - instead of that
02:48 - so if you've ever wondered how do those
02:50 - triple a games have some gorgeous
02:52 - lighting with day night cycles and great
02:53 - performance
02:54 - well this is how they do it another
02:56 - really interesting package here
02:57 - a dodge character controller it's been
03:00 - quite a long time since i last touched
03:02 - dots
03:02 - i really want to get back into it but i
03:04 - haven't had the time
03:05 - it's great to see that dot is already
03:07 - advanced enough that some asset like
03:08 - this is possible
03:10 - although do keep in mind that dots is
03:11 - still in development so this package is
03:13 - in preview just like the official one
03:15 - but based on the positive reviews it
03:17 - does seem like it's very well made
03:19 - so if you want to explore some dots then
03:21 - maybe look into this one to see how it
03:22 - works
03:23 - if you're looking for a complete game
03:24 - pack here is the rpg island tycoon
03:27 - it's an idle dungeon game so your
03:29 - character is constantly moving as
03:31 - enemies get spawned
03:32 - you gain some gold and weapons as you
03:34 - defeat your enemies open up a bunch of
03:36 - chests and level up your character
03:38 - it's a complete game kit so it's perfect
03:40 - for learning
03:41 - you've gotten lots of features pretty
03:43 - much everything you would expect from
03:44 - this genre
03:45 - also has support for easily adding unity
03:47 - ads or in-game purchases for gems and
03:49 - coins
03:50 - check it out and build upon it if you
03:52 - want to interact with any object
03:54 - check out the universal interaction
03:56 - system it's a modular system that can
03:58 - convert
03:59 - any object into an interactable object
04:01 - easily add all kinds of interactions
04:04 - so you can carry an object you can grab
04:06 - and inspect them block a bunch of things
04:08 - with planks chairs and break them
04:10 - make a key lock system and so on a lot
04:12 - of it is made to work within the events
04:14 - so you can easily integrate it into your
04:16 - own games
04:17 - also includes integration with rayfire
04:18 - and the hq fps template
04:21 - if you want to know how your players are
04:22 - playing your game here is the heatmap
04:24 - inputs analyzer
04:25 - this is super useful especially during
04:27 - play testing so it keeps track of where
04:30 - your players click or touch
04:31 - and for how long so you can use it to
04:34 - see if your players are clicking on the
04:35 - wrong place
04:36 - in order to optimize and guide the
04:37 - player to the correct inputs
04:39 - play around with tons of parameters to
04:41 - get it working exactly as you need
04:43 - then generate some gorgeous high quality
04:45 - lighting with the upgen lighting urp
04:47 - asset it creates a more realistic
04:50 - lighting than defaults
04:51 - makes a more natural light especially in
04:53 - darker environments
04:55 - the videos showcase a pretty significant
04:57 - difference especially when you add some
04:58 - ray trace global illumination
05:01 - if you want your game somewhat even
05:02 - better then maybe look into this one
05:04 - this package is for urp but there's
05:06 - other ones for the built-in and
05:07 - hdrp as well then here's another
05:09 - interesting one to solve a problem that
05:11 - perhaps you don't even know about
05:13 - it's the continuous floating origin the
05:15 - issue is that floats are just numbers
05:17 - stored in memory
05:18 - and since your computer has limited
05:20 - memory that means that it has limited
05:21 - precision
05:23 - floats specifically need enough memory
05:24 - to keep both the main number
05:26 - and the decimals which means they are
05:28 - quite a bit more limited in range than
05:30 - ins so as you move further and further
05:32 - away from the origin
05:33 - things start to behave very weirdly if
05:35 - you've never built some massive games
05:37 - you might not have come across this
05:38 - problem
05:39 - well what this asset does is it keeps
05:41 - moving the origin so your floats don't
05:43 - have to turn into monumentally massive
05:45 - numbers
05:45 - specifically the origin is always on top
05:47 - of the player so the collisions happen
05:49 - right near the origin which means no
05:51 - jitter
05:52 - no glitches if you're working on a
05:53 - massive game then a solution like this
05:55 - one is definitely a must
05:56 - and up here is a graph system it's a
05:59 - tool for drawing all kinds of lines
06:01 - add some points anywhere and make some
06:03 - really nice curves change the color
06:05 - visual the online width and so on
06:07 - it seems like this would be a great tool
06:09 - for maybe a multiplayer strategy game
06:10 - for displaying the plan before the
06:12 - mission
06:12 - alright so those are my top 10 new tools
06:15 - and systems on the unity asset store for
06:17 - june 2021
