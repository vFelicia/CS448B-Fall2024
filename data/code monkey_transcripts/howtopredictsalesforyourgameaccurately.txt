00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your KMI here's an
00:02 - article titled sales comps for your game
00:04 - how not to do it also how to do it
00:06 - better so sales comps or sales
00:08 - comparisons this is definitely a very
00:09 - interesting topic if you're trying to
00:11 - make in the game development as a
00:12 - profession instead of just a hobby this
00:14 - is probably one of the first few things
00:15 - that you're going to do and importantly
00:17 - most people actually start off by doing
00:19 - it quite wrong so for example some
00:20 - people look at Call of Duty and they're
00:22 - like okay Call of Duty sld 30 million
00:23 - copies surely if I make my own Indie
00:26 - firstperson shooter surely I can sell at
00:28 - least a million copies obviously that's
00:30 - sounds absurd when I say it out loud but
00:31 - a lot of people do think like that in
00:33 - some more less Extreme Ways so let's
00:35 - read a bit more about this topic do you
00:37 - want to get more wish list and more
00:38 - sales if so then you need to learn all
00:40 - about marketing it's absolutely
00:41 - essential nowadays you need to learn the
00:43 - best practices and how to stand out one
00:45 - place where I've learned a lot myself
00:46 - has been from Chris zakowski I've been
00:48 - reading the newsletter for many years
00:49 - now learning marketing is definitely one
00:51 - of the most valuable skills you can get
00:53 - the difference between not knowing
00:54 - marketing and putting this knowledge
00:55 - into practice is pretty much going to be
00:57 - difference between selling just a dozen
00:58 - copies versus selling thousand
01:00 - so marketing is definitely a super
01:01 - valuable skill that you should spend
01:03 - either some time or some money in order
01:04 - to learn and right now Chris is running
01:06 - a sale on his courses this is really
01:08 - awesome for condensing a ton of
01:09 - information in a single course the links
01:11 - to the course include a special discount
01:13 - and they are affiliate links which means
01:14 - you get an awesome deal and some super
01:16 - valuable knowledge while I get a nice
01:17 - commission so check it out with a link
01:19 - in the description so over here it says
01:21 - I remember when this was all Fields you
01:23 - know the internet all we had was IRC FTP
01:25 - and a little bit of tet now you've got
01:27 - your twitches and your Tik toks and now
01:29 - we have to to worry about whether people
01:30 - notice the stuff we make too and right
01:32 - away this actually a very interesting
01:33 - sentiment basally it's the fact how in
01:35 - indie game development especially things
01:37 - move so quickly that if you read some
01:39 - advice from 5 years ago chances are a
01:41 - lot of it might not apply nowadays the
01:43 - way you did game marketing back when
01:45 - there was just IRC and FTP that was very
01:47 - different from nowadays where you got
01:49 - twitch and Tik Tok so if you want to
01:50 - learn in game marketing this is
01:51 - something you have to keep the to date
01:53 - pretty much all the time this imaginary
01:55 - comment is courtesy of someone who
01:56 - doesn't grck that the internet's reach
01:58 - has multiplied near infinitely your
02:00 - games can out reach billions of people
02:01 - online instead of 12 sweaty nerds in a
02:03 - university computer lab back in 1993 so
02:06 - let's go on and work out how exactly to
02:07 - do that this goes back to the original
02:09 - thing that I mentioned there are so many
02:10 - millions and millions of people playing
02:12 - games seam has something like 150
02:14 - million monthly active users that's an
02:16 - insane amount so again you might think
02:17 - to yourself okay if I'm Mak an indie
02:19 - game what is the difficulty of me being
02:20 - able to sell to just 0.1% of that if I
02:23 - just sell to .1% of 150 million that
02:26 - would be an insane amount that would be
02:27 - more than enough to make my game viable
02:29 - but that number sounds very achievable
02:31 - very small in reality it is actually
02:33 - very difficult to achieve Sals comps in
02:35 - estimating reach for your games so
02:37 - discoveries of about on point making
02:38 - sure your game gets out there and is
02:39 - success but in order to budget your game
02:41 - correctly you may also need to estimate
02:43 - how many units you think it's going to
02:44 - sell and if you don't do this then a
02:46 - publisher definitely will so if you are
02:47 - trying to make games professionally make
02:49 - this as your job if so then this is
02:51 - absolutely a question you need to answer
02:53 - every time you come up with some kind of
02:54 - game idea and you're validating whether
02:55 - that idea is going to be potentially
02:57 - successful or not every time you do that
02:59 - you definitely need need to do this you
03:00 - need to do some analysis in order to
03:01 - figure out is this genre is this idea
03:04 - even possible or not there are some
03:06 - things that even if you come up with a
03:07 - great game the market for that idea
03:09 - might be way too Niche to the point
03:10 - where it's not even worth it or maybe it
03:13 - might be worth it but it might be a lot
03:14 - more difficult to sell the number of
03:15 - copies that you need to sell so which
03:17 - brings up the interesting qu how should
03:19 - developers think about estimating
03:20 - possible Ro on a game whether sell
03:22 - funding or not and how should Publishers
03:24 - slf funders think about it some framing
03:26 - thoughts so the first obvious point is
03:28 - that Publishers have a portfol of games
03:30 - to manage risk this is another very
03:31 - interesting point between the quite big
03:33 - difference between a indie game
03:35 - publisher and a indie game developer for
03:38 - a publisher if they publish multiple
03:39 - games they don't necessarily need all of
03:41 - those games to be hits they can have a
03:43 - few games that are flops as long as the
03:44 - other ones are exal hits in the end they
03:47 - will be all right but if you are a indie
03:49 - game developer if your game is the only
03:51 - thing you have the only thing that is
03:52 - going to make some money for the next 5
03:54 - years or something if so then you
03:56 - definitely have different questions you
03:57 - need to ask yourself as opposed to a
03:59 - publisher who can
04:00 - help mitigate Risk by diversifying their
04:02 - portfolio of games and in today's market
04:04 - I believe they should be expecting a
04:05 - minority of their games to be in larger
04:06 - hits and help fund the others so this
04:08 - changes their risk profile they're
04:10 - looking for the 20% of games that can
04:12 - break out but they still need to pick
04:13 - realistic comparables on the other hand
04:15 - if you're a Dev pitching a publisher
04:17 - funer it's in your best interest to be
04:19 - fairly optimistic with the comps the
04:21 - funer can ignore those or not though
04:22 - don't look naively over optimistic devs
04:25 - but you should commend framing a
04:26 - significant possible upside and let the
04:28 - funer produce their own take now for me
04:30 - personally I've never published a game
04:31 - all of my games have been self-published
04:33 - so I've never used a publisher so it's
04:35 - always interesting to read about how
04:36 - things work in that world in the world
04:38 - of trying to pitch to a publisher in
04:40 - order to get some funding and apparently
04:42 - the goal is to be fairly optimistic
04:44 - although not delusionally optimistic
04:46 - then if you're a Dev that is putting
04:47 - down your own money and you need Roi to
04:49 - sell fund your game then you need to
04:51 - have a much more conservative risk
04:52 - profile or at least a plan B contract
04:54 - work taking another gig Etc if the game
04:57 - doesn't return as you expect simp like I
04:59 - said if you are fun in your game you
05:00 - definitely need to be very aware of the
05:02 - risk profile of how much are you risking
05:04 - with that game something that always
05:05 - breaks my heart is when I see some posts
05:07 - on Twitter or something of someone
05:08 - saying that they spent five years
05:10 - working on a game and comes out and just
05:12 - sells a 100 copies that always hurts to
05:14 - see but suddenly that is the reality
05:15 - this a very competitive business so if
05:17 - you are trying to make this your job
05:19 - definitely make sure you have at least
05:20 - some kind of plan B and when estimating
05:22 - sales definitely don't assume your game
05:23 - is going to be a mega hit like for
05:25 - example if you're trying to build an
05:26 - auto battle game the recent hit that
05:29 - just came out is backpack battles it's
05:31 - got almost 2,000 reviews in just a few
05:33 - weeks so if you were to make an auto
05:35 - battle you should not compare yourself
05:36 - to this inste you should scroll down and
05:38 - look at all the releases and if you do
05:40 - then you can look at the more normal
05:42 - Games quote unquote and you can start to
05:44 - get a better idea of what exactly this
05:46 - genre provides how many sales the
05:48 - average game on this genre can do so
05:50 - continuing traditional methods of
05:51 - working out possible revenue for games
05:53 - often start by looking at Key games in
05:54 - that genre or sub genre and there's a
05:56 - super helpful New Market study goem
05:58 - sheet it links to this Google sheet
06:00 - which actually has a ton of information
06:02 - apparently you can just save this and
06:03 - write your own order to do some kind of
06:05 - Market study so if you like to do this
06:07 - this looks like a great starting point
06:09 - so if you're making a TOD metroidvania
06:11 - go to seams Tod Metroid Vania category
06:13 - page enter some of the top selling games
06:15 - as comps write down the median Revenue
06:17 - numbers and that's how much money your
06:19 - game will make so is that right nope
06:20 - that is definitely what you should not
06:22 - do so one of the tips is to be realistic
06:24 - try to pick recent games in that sub
06:26 - genre this is probably one of the best
06:28 - tips because again like I said the indie
06:30 - game Market moves very quickly very fast
06:32 - and if you look at very old titles
06:33 - chances are you're only going to see the
06:35 - very successful ones and those have had
06:37 - a ton of years to gather a ton of sales
06:39 - so if you use those for comparisons
06:41 - those are probably going to be way over
06:43 - what you could possibly realistically
06:44 - get so the second one is the top
06:46 - Evergreen comps can be much updated
06:48 - games that date from an area of much
06:49 - less competition so one good example of
06:51 - that is Terraria this one came out in
06:54 - 2011 and it has literally a million
06:56 - reviews so this definitely a mega hit
06:58 - but do you think that if you launch a
07:00 - game just like terrar nowadays would
07:02 - that sell the same amount of copies the
07:03 - answer is definitely not again nowadays
07:06 - is a very different world from 2011 the
07:08 - competition is much more Fierce and even
07:10 - games like Terraria they are still
07:11 - getting updates so still getting some
07:12 - players and last tip is if you are Dev
07:15 - pitching to Publishers still play up the
07:16 - top selling coms if we inste we look at
07:19 - 2D crafting exploration games now we can
07:22 - look and get a bit more of a realistic
07:23 - comparison of what exactly might be done
07:26 - in this kind of genre and also in terms
07:28 - of math how do you actually C sales
07:30 - estimate based on just looking at a seam
07:32 - page the answer to that is based on the
07:33 - review count using a multiplier for the
07:35 - review count is one of the best ways you
07:37 - have of guessing how many sales the game
07:39 - had based on the reviews and actually
07:41 - going back into that doc that I showed a
07:43 - while ago over here you can see how that
07:45 - count that number that multiplier that
07:47 - one has changed based on the years so if
07:49 - you are calculating the number of sales
07:51 - for a game from 10 years ago that is
07:52 - going to be very different math from a
07:54 - game that just came out so for example
07:55 - for my own game ding Guardians we can
07:57 - guess for example 77 * 40 and we get a
08:00 - rough estimate of about 3,000 copies
08:01 - sold and with the game being 15 bucks
08:03 - and about 6 months old for that let's
08:06 - estimate something like 10 bucks per
08:07 - copy so multiply this by 10 bucks and
08:10 - you get a very rough guesstimate of
08:11 - about $30,000 in gross revenue now this
08:13 - is my own game so I can just show you
08:15 - the exact stat so the total number of
08:17 - copy solds actually Clos to 2,000 and
08:19 - the total gross revenue is about 27k so
08:21 - as you can see this is just a rough
08:22 - estimate but it's definitely not off by
08:24 - about a factor of two so in order to do
08:26 - some proper sales comps you would go on
08:27 - seam and search for games with same tags
08:30 - as whatever game you're currently making
08:31 - then start from new release then look
08:33 - back for maybe about a year do that and
08:35 - go through a bunch of these games and
08:36 - try to figure out what games look
08:38 - similar to what you think you can
08:39 - produce or what you think your game
08:41 - currently looks like now obviously at
08:43 - this point it is very important to be
08:44 - very honest with yourself for example in
08:46 - my case for making D Gardens which is a
08:48 - sort of automation game I can be pretty
08:50 - honest with myself and see that nope it
08:52 - does not compare anywhere close to what
08:54 - for example dys spere program looks like
08:57 - so be very honest with yourself with
08:58 - what exactly you can build with the
09:00 - resources you have available then come
09:02 - up with a list of about 10 games that
09:03 - are somewhat similar to yours similar I
09:05 - mean in terms of hook in terms of
09:07 - complexity in terms of production value
09:09 - so something like that then look at all
09:10 - their reviews and do that kind of math
09:12 - in order to figure out how much money
09:13 - might your game make again importantly
09:15 - make sure you do realistic comparisons
09:17 - don't compare yourself to the top 1% of
09:19 - whatever genre you're working on so when
09:21 - it comes to making sales comparisons for
09:22 - your game definitely make sure you do it
09:23 - realistically and if you do and you find
09:25 - a particular hook a particular Niche
09:27 - that both you would like to make and
09:29 - have potential and viability if so then
09:31 - that is probably going to be a much
09:32 - better bet as opposed to just making the
09:33 - first thing that comes to your head and
09:35 - just hoping for the best and if you want
09:36 - to find more success with your games
