00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and one comment that i see every once in
00:03 - a while is something along the lines of
00:06 - oh i really don't want to use assets in
00:07 - my game i want to build everything
00:09 - myself from scratch using assets feels
00:11 - like cheating and i don't want people
00:13 - angry at me calling my game an acid flip
00:15 - i see that kind of comment every once in
00:17 - a while especially in my acid highlight
00:18 - or my asset review videos so if you are
00:21 - the kind of person who has that kind of
00:22 - thoughts let me tell you that thought is
00:24 - probably causing more harm than good
00:26 - now there is a huge difference between
00:28 - using assets correctly and making an
00:29 - asset flip i'm going to talk about that
00:31 - difference in event so this video is all
00:33 - about games using assets but in case you
00:36 - want to make those assets yourself then
00:37 - one great place to start is with this
00:39 - excellent blender 3d course it's what
00:41 - i've been following and i've already
00:42 - managed to learn quite a lot enough to
00:44 - make a mini game all with my own
00:45 - original assets and that course is
00:47 - included as part of the gamedevtv bundle
00:50 - with three courses that were hand
00:51 - selected by me to teach you everything
00:53 - related to game development learn all
00:55 - about unity with the unt 3d course then
00:57 - learn how to make 3d models in blender
00:59 - and finally learn how to write good
01:01 - clean code using programming patterns
01:03 - check out the entire code monkey gamedev
01:05 - tv bundle with the link in description
01:07 - ok so back to the video as for what gave
01:09 - me the idea for making a video on this
01:11 - topic as you might know i normally do a
01:13 - top 10 steam unity games list every
01:16 - month so every month i go through all
01:18 - the new releases look at what games look
01:20 - interesting and pick 10 of them because
01:22 - of that i essentially see tons and tons
01:24 - of games and lately i've noticed more
01:26 - and more games on steam that are being
01:28 - quite successful with sales and positive
01:29 - reviews and i immediately noticed that
01:32 - they're using cinti studio's assets i've
01:34 - used their assets so much and they have
01:35 - such a signature style that is
01:37 - immediately identifiable for example
01:40 - over here is no plan b which just came
01:42 - out in december this one is a great
01:44 - looking swat tactics game you set up
01:46 - your squad you equip them and send them
01:48 - out on missions then you click and drag
01:50 - to draw the path where they will move
01:52 - and what actions they won't take it's a
01:54 - very clever design with some unique
01:55 - mechanics so if you're like me and you
01:57 - can recognize in the assets then you
01:59 - know some of these are from the gangpak
02:01 - others from the heist pack and probably
02:03 - some others
02:04 - now the question is just looking at this
02:06 - trailer what do you think about it
02:08 - personally i really like swat tactics
02:10 - games so this is immediately appealing
02:11 - to me and even though i immediately
02:14 - identify the assets as being from an
02:16 - asset pack that fact really does not
02:17 - cause me to have a negative image of the
02:19 - game at all the only thing i care about
02:21 - is that it's mechanically interesting
02:23 - the genre appeals to me and it looks
02:25 - great
02:26 - so my question to you if you recognize
02:27 - the assets did that cause a negative
02:29 - impression of the game
02:31 - but regardless of what you or i think
02:33 - the important thing is hearing what the
02:35 - players think so for that we can just go
02:37 - ahead and look at the reviews so far it
02:39 - has over a hundred very positive reviews
02:42 - and if you browse them you really just
02:43 - see people that really love the game
02:45 - and on top of that some people also
02:47 - praise the visuals now i browsed all of
02:49 - the reviews and i could not find a
02:51 - single one that mentioned anything
02:52 - related to assets
02:54 - so either that means that players did
02:55 - not recognize the assets or it simply
02:57 - means that all the players want is a
02:59 - good game to play so the question is
03:01 - simple if this developer had taken the
03:03 - time to build their own custom 3d models
03:05 - would that have made a better game
03:08 - now the answer will obviously depend on
03:09 - the 3d modeling skills of that developer
03:12 - if the developer is comprised of people
03:13 - like myself with no 3d modeling skills
03:16 - then really the only two possible
03:17 - scenarios is to either use assets or
03:19 - don't make the game like i said i really
03:21 - like the concept of the game and i'm
03:23 - looking forward to playing it whenever i
03:25 - have the time so i'm glad the developers
03:27 - chose to use assets rather than cancel
03:28 - their game idea
03:30 - let's look at another example that is
03:31 - making even heavier use of assets so
03:33 - it's this one perfect heist too
03:35 - this one you can immediately see it's
03:37 - using the cinti heist pack you might
03:39 - notice right away that this is exactly
03:41 - the heist pack demo scene personally i
03:43 - would say this is right on the edge of
03:45 - acceptable
03:46 - i think you should build your own scenes
03:48 - rather than using the included them will
03:49 - just straight up but regardless of what
03:51 - i think let's once again see what the
03:53 - players think and once again it's the
03:55 - same story the reviews are really
03:56 - positive because the game itself is
03:58 - actually great again i browsed all of
04:00 - the reviews and i could not find a
04:02 - single mention of any paid assets or
04:04 - anything
04:05 - the game has interesting mechanics works
04:07 - as expected and plays really well that's
04:09 - really all the players care about how
04:11 - this game play is it fun to play most of
04:13 - them really won't care how it was made
04:15 - as long as the final result is good
04:17 - here's another one shelter manager this
04:19 - one is clearly using assets from the
04:21 - cindy apocalypse pack and once again no
04:23 - mention of assets all of the reviews are
04:25 - on the quality of the game itself some
04:26 - of them are just basically on how some
04:28 - players like the game and some don't
04:30 - a recent example is clown film 2042 this
04:33 - one is obviously a joke on battlefield
04:35 - 2042 this one seems to be based on the
04:38 - low poly shooter pack which is a
04:40 - complete starting template and then on
04:41 - top of that has some visual assets from
04:43 - the cintiq battle round pack and the
04:45 - cyberpunk pack again for me i would say
04:47 - this one is just on the edge of being
04:48 - acceptable due to using the demo scene
04:51 - straight up
04:52 - but the players really don't care the
04:53 - game is fun and they enjoy it and with
04:55 - this one being such a timely joke this
04:58 - one would simply not be possible to be
05:00 - made this quickly if the developer had
05:02 - built everything from scratch so without
05:04 - assets this game would simply not exist
05:06 - and these players would not be having
05:07 - fun and there's many many more examples
05:10 - here is one that looks like a mix
05:11 - between crazy taxi and euro truck
05:13 - simulator once again great reviews the
05:16 - players love the game for how it plays
05:17 - and no one cares that these are paid
05:19 - assets the concept is interesting and it
05:21 - plays well that's all that matters then
05:24 - here is a multiplayer shooter with
05:25 - large-scale encounters and again lots of
05:27 - players simply enjoying the game now all
05:30 - this is not to say that you should do
05:31 - asset flips absolutely not
05:33 - asset flips are absolutely bad and you
05:35 - should not do that but let's clarify
05:38 - exactly what is an asset flip if you buy
05:41 - a complete game template from the store
05:42 - like for example this factory game
05:44 - template if you just buy that and you
05:46 - just uploaded the same without any
05:48 - changes without adding anything to it if
05:50 - so then that's an asset flip so don't do
05:52 - that that's bad
05:54 - however if you are working on your own
05:56 - original game and you need some assets
05:58 - or some system to make your vision come
05:59 - to life then that is not an asset flip
06:02 - and you should definitely do that even
06:04 - for example starting from a template
06:05 - like that one if you use that as a
06:07 - starting point and you build upon it to
06:09 - make something completely different you
06:10 - can add more items more visuals more
06:12 - mechanics more of everything at that
06:15 - point the funnel game is no longer an
06:16 - asset flip but rather your own original
06:18 - game idea that simply started from a
06:20 - template it's the same thing for all the
06:22 - projects that i'm making these videos
06:24 - feel free to download the project files
06:25 - and use them as base to build upon and
06:27 - build your own original games so
06:29 - basically if you have your own idea that
06:31 - you're trying to build use whatever
06:33 - assets you need in order to bring that
06:34 - idea to life what matters is really the
06:37 - final result you don't get bonus points
06:39 - for building everything yourself and you
06:41 - also don't get penalty points for using
06:43 - third party assets as long as the final
06:45 - game is great that's really all that
06:47 - matters your players want to have fun so
06:49 - go ahead and give them fun by any means
06:51 - necessary
06:52 - so if you're the kind of person that has
06:54 - the kind of thoughts that i mentioned in
06:55 - the beginning then hopefully this video
06:57 - helped you see how you can use assets
06:59 - correctly to improve your game don't be
07:01 - afraid to use every tool at your
07:02 - disposal to make your game ideas come to
07:04 - life as long as you use them properly
07:06 - your game will be better and your
07:07 - players won't love you for it alright
07:09 - hope that's useful check out these
07:11 - videos to learn some more thanks to
07:13 - these awesome patreon supporters for
07:14 - making these videos possible
07:16 - thank you for watching and i'll see you
07:17 - next time
