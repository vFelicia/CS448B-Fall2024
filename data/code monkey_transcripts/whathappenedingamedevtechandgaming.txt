00:00 - bra is is back while you should create
00:02 - the same game over and over again one of
00:04 - the most anticipated games of all time
00:06 - has released H divers 2 completely
00:08 - imploded and then recovered and more
00:10 - here's the most important news in Game
00:11 - Dev Tekken gaming today is the 13th of
00:13 - May of 2024 and you're watching The Game
00:16 - Dev
00:19 - [Music]
00:23 - report starting off with some quick
00:25 - Unity news Unity has found a new CEO his
00:28 - name is Matthew Bromberg and right away
00:30 - people were a little bit concerned when
00:31 - they saw that he came from EA and Zinga
00:33 - so people feared that Unity might go
00:35 - back to the Rick Del era and lose its
00:37 - focus again however Matthew was at EA
00:39 - specifically at BioWare during their
00:41 - Heyday and Zinga regardless of whether
00:43 - you like mobile games or not they are a
00:45 - very successful company he was also the
00:47 - CEO of Major League Gaming back in the
00:49 - day so he definitely does have a strong
00:50 - gaming background I haven't heard too
00:52 - much on the vibe inside Unity itself it
00:54 - seems that no one knows too much about
00:56 - them there's just a vague message from
00:57 - will who has been at Unity for 20 years
01:00 - whereas when Jim White Hurst became the
01:01 - interim CEO the sentiment inside and
01:03 - outside the company was positive right
01:05 - away I did actually have a quick meeting
01:07 - with Jim and some other y insiders when
01:09 - he became the interim CEO and I told him
01:11 - how my concern would be that he makes
01:13 - all these nice positive changes of
01:14 - refocusing on the core of the engine
01:16 - which is awesome but then the next CEO
01:18 - would come in and completely change
01:19 - things back that was my concern and his
01:22 - answer was that he's confident that if
01:24 - he manages to turn the ship around if he
01:26 - does that and gets the company refocused
01:28 - then whoever comes afterwards won't
01:29 - complain destroy all of that from what I
01:31 - can see Jim was involved in picking new
01:33 - CEO and Jim is staying on board so
01:35 - hopefully that means this direction of
01:37 - refocusing on the core game engine is
01:38 - continuing there are some interviews
01:40 - with Matthew and it sounds like he's of
01:41 - the same mindset as Jim being player and
01:44 - Community Focus so hopefully this trend
01:45 - won't continue the unite conference
01:48 - later in September this year should be
01:49 - an interesting time then in some pretty
01:51 - huge game that news brais is back this
01:53 - was definitely an unexpected surprise in
01:55 - case you don't know brais was by far the
01:57 - biggest game to have channel for a long
01:59 - time specifically for Unity millions of
02:01 - views and 1.7 million subscribers he
02:03 - made lots of tutorials mostly beginner
02:05 - focus with an excellent presentation
02:07 - I've certainly learned a lot myself on
02:09 - how to better present my tutorials by
02:10 - watching his videos he retired from
02:12 - YouTube three years ago and now suddenly
02:14 - out of nowhere he came back and the big
02:15 - thing is how he came back to make
02:17 - tutorials on gdau instead of unity the
02:19 - gdau community is obviously ecstatic
02:21 - about this he already put out his first
02:22 - video a 1our video covering the basics
02:25 - and making a nice simple platform game I
02:27 - watch it myself to see an overview for
02:28 - how good works so what is a node how
02:31 - components are attached how they use
02:32 - physics how the to Maps work and so on
02:34 - the video is really great excellent
02:36 - presented so if you are a g developer or
02:38 - if you're a Unity or unreal Dev and just
02:40 - want to see how the engine works then
02:41 - definitely go ahead and watch it in more
02:42 - Unity news Unity 6 preview is out right
02:45 - now now this is important because this
02:47 - is the last version before the LTS
02:48 - release and this version contains all
02:50 - the same features as the LDS mainly it's
02:52 - all of those awesome graphical features
02:54 - that make your game run super fast with
02:56 - a single button click alongside of
02:58 - course tons of other improvements now
03:00 - personally I don't normally use beta
03:01 - versions so I haven't really touched un6
03:03 - at all but now this is the main version
03:05 - that I'm going to be using going forward
03:06 - if your game is about to release then
03:08 - definitely stick with the LTS version
03:09 - you're using but if you are six plus
03:11 - months away from release then maybe look
03:12 - into this version also on that quick
03:14 - video where I talked about this release
03:15 - there were some comments asking what
03:17 - about the whole thing with the runtime
03:18 - fee I talked about it in detail in the
03:20 - last video during that whole Saga but
03:22 - the ldr is quite simply the fee does
03:24 - exist but the fee only applies after 1
03:26 - million copies sold and $1 million in
03:28 - rep so if you are needed kind of like me
03:30 - you're never really going to hit those
03:31 - massive fresh ons so there's really no
03:33 - changes and if you do hit the lottery
03:35 - and you make a mega hit any game if so
03:37 - then the fee caps out at 2.5% that's it
03:39 - and I was also waiting for this Unity 6
03:41 - version for one specific thing to
03:43 - finally start working on my upcoming
03:44 - Unity do scor that's something that
03:46 - people have been asking me to do for
03:47 - ages and I also really want to explore
03:49 - using Unity dos in a complete game
03:51 - myself I was waiting for Unity 6 in
03:52 - order to make the video as up to date
03:54 - for as long as possible so now that this
03:56 - version is out I have started doing some
03:57 - research on it it won't be an RTS game
03:59 - with defense elements kind of like the
04:01 - game they are billions I'm still very
04:02 - much in the early stages I only have a
04:04 - basic prototype up and running but if
04:06 - you are interested in learning about
04:07 - thoughts or if you're interested in
04:09 - learning how to make an RTS if so then
04:10 - check the link in the description I've
04:12 - set up a page for the course it's mostly
04:14 - empty but it has a place to sign up with
04:15 - your email if you're interested now I
04:17 - have no idea when the course will be
04:18 - done but when it is I'll send you an
04:20 - email then here's a game that got 30,000
04:22 - wish lists in two weeks and how exactly
04:24 - they did it now the game is called
04:25 - dungeon clawler so right away the name
04:28 - is very clever the main hook is how it's
04:30 - a Dungeon Crawler but you get your
04:31 - skills by using a claw machine you pick
04:33 - up some objects and then your character
04:35 - does the actions I think this is another
04:37 - example of just how important it is
04:38 - nowadays that you have a very clear very
04:40 - interesting hook as soon as you see this
04:42 - game you probably think oh that sounds
04:43 - really interesting if you do want to
04:45 - find success and that's really the exact
04:46 - kind of feeling your game has to invoke
04:48 - in the player's Minds they've got lots
04:49 - of Interest especially from Japan where
04:51 - apparently clubw machines are really
04:52 - popular alongside the announcement they
04:54 - released a demo right away which they
04:55 - promoted on their older games then a few
04:58 - days after the announcement the scene
04:59 - their fast tarting since the game is
05:01 - great it got pushed to the top of the
05:03 - festival demo list and it just continued
05:05 - building from there but remember how it
05:06 - all starts from an interesting
05:08 - compelling game hook if you want to make
05:09 - successful games and definitely spend
05:11 - some time picking the right hook before
05:12 - going into production go watch my video
05:15 - on how to learn ingame marketing from
05:16 - some sources where you can learn exactly
05:19 - what makes a good hook and now a quick
05:21 - word from our sponsor which is me if you
05:23 - want to learn how to make games or make
05:25 - websites learn about robotics
05:27 - Electronics iot or just about anything
05:29 - if so then learning C is a super useful
05:31 - skill and you can learn that for free
05:33 - right here on YouTube with my C course I
05:35 - put my 10 years of C knowledge into this
05:37 - one course you can watch the free videos
05:39 - over here on YouTube or you can get the
05:41 - premium version which includes a
05:42 - compenent project with interactive
05:43 - exercise and a ton of other bonuses to
05:45 - help you learn by doing so check it out
05:47 - with the link in the description or if
05:48 - you need any visuals for games and
05:50 - there's actually a sale happening right
05:51 - now on the cint store it features their
05:53 - classic low style they have a mountain
05:56 - of unique packs no matter what game
05:57 - ideas you're trying to make you can
05:58 - definitely find a pack perfect for it
06:00 - next year's an interesting idea why you
06:02 - should create the same game over and
06:03 - over again now this is something that a
06:05 - lot of Indies probably have an aversion
06:07 - to for a lot of Indies creativity is key
06:09 - so making 20 Battlefield games or 50
06:11 - Sims DLCs probably does not appeal to
06:13 - them but there is value in doing the
06:14 - same thing over and over again this
06:16 - article is from the game discover code
06:18 - newsletter which by the way this is a
06:19 - great newsletter for learning about the
06:20 - games Market in general I highly
06:22 - recommend this is the next Ser from a
06:24 - book that talks about how you gain quite
06:25 - a lot of knowledge by building a project
06:27 - especially if that project is successful
06:30 - so if you do find success with something
06:31 - why not make something similar but
06:33 - better in all the ways that you learned
06:34 - with that project instead of saring
06:36 - completely from scratch personally I
06:37 - think that this concept has a lot of
06:39 - value however I don't necessarily think
06:40 - you need to make the exact same game
06:42 - over and over again I don't think you
06:44 - need to make like 50 seems DLCs or 50
06:46 - direct sequels but I do think there's a
06:48 - lot of value in making multiple games in
06:50 - a similar genre now for me I like
06:51 - playing and making Tycoon games my last
06:53 - one was batt Tycoon it is by far the
06:56 - most complex management gem I've done
06:58 - there's tons of interconnected systems
07:00 - but before that I made game cor DX I
07:02 - made blueprint Tycoon and ninja Tycoon I
07:04 - think it is because I made those first
07:06 - that I was then able to make a very
07:07 - complex game afterwards I definitely
07:09 - gained a lot of Knowledge from making
07:11 - multiple games in the same genre so
07:13 - maybe don't make exact direct sequels if
07:15 - you don't want to do that but it's
07:16 - probably wise to take advantage of what
07:18 - you learned with your last game and then
07:19 - use it to make the next game in the same
07:21 - genre even better instead of always
07:22 - jumping from genre to genre making
07:24 - something completely new every time okay
07:26 - now let's move on to the tech news
07:29 - starting off with some probably expected
07:31 - news apple is reportedly cutting Vision
07:33 - Pro production due to demand apparently
07:35 - they were expecting to sell 700,000
07:37 - units and now only 400,000 I would say
07:40 - the hype has definitely died down which
07:41 - is expected but I don't think I've seen
07:43 - a single Vision Pro video since shortly
07:45 - after launch so it seems that the hype
07:47 - has died down a lot more than they were
07:49 - anticipating on the one hand I love how
07:51 - Apple pushed Tech to the Max and made
07:52 - probably the best headset out there with
07:54 - no regards to cost from all the reviews
07:56 - that I've seen the screen is excellent
07:58 - the pass through is nearly perfect the
07:59 - anchoring is Flawless and everything
08:01 - works really well but VR and AR is both
08:03 - about hardware and software with such a
08:06 - small install base it's hard to see many
08:07 - people developing forign so now my next
08:10 - question is will Apple stay committed to
08:11 - this device will they pour money into
08:13 - Developers for making software and make
08:15 - future cheaper iterations or is this
08:17 - really going to be it I would guess they
08:19 - are committed for long term but selling
08:20 - half the number of units might put that
08:22 - commitment into question so I guess we
08:24 - won't see in the future at least meta is
08:26 - currently trying to push that area
08:27 - forward speaking of meta they open up
08:29 - their ecosystem to anyone who wants to
08:30 - make advice for it it does feel a bit
08:32 - strange to see Meta pushing so hard for
08:34 - openness but that is really a great
08:36 - thing this means that Hardware makers
08:38 - can now make their own devices that use
08:39 - the same OS you can find in a meta quest
08:41 - Quest headset hopefully this means more
08:43 - devices that exist and also hopefully
08:45 - this makes it easier for developers to
08:46 - make multiplatform apps that run on
08:48 - pretty much any device but of course
08:50 - this can also lead to fragmentation John
08:52 - carck who you might know as one of the
08:53 - founders of It software and was also the
08:55 - CTO of oculus he made a nice post
08:58 - sharing his thoughts on this news he
08:59 - mentions how this probably does not mean
09:01 - cheaper headsets meta is already pretty
09:03 - much selling them at cost The Meta Quest
09:05 - 2 recently got a permanent price top to
09:07 - 200 bucks it's hard to see a company
09:09 - with a much smaller scale being able to
09:11 - somehow manufacture a headset for
09:13 - cheaper however what this might do is
09:15 - encourage companies to make hypers
09:16 - specific headsets that are perfect for
09:18 - one specific Niche so for example you
09:20 - might get a headset that has maximum
09:22 - resolution and frame rate another one
09:24 - that goes for maximum comfort and low
09:25 - weight you might get another one
09:27 - specifically for VR Fitness One for
09:29 - being a second monitor for watching
09:31 - movies and so on so that could be
09:32 - interesting but it could also lead to a
09:34 - lot of fragmentation there's already
09:36 - three third party headset announced one
09:38 - is from Asus RG one from Lenovo and a
09:41 - limited edition one related to Xbox so
09:43 - hopefully this is good news for VR in
09:45 - general Marquez has tried out the secret
09:47 - Disney holot this is a 360 treadmill
09:50 - that looks quite interesting there have
09:52 - been a few of these around for a while
09:53 - but usually they unlock you in place
09:55 - this one does not lock you at all it's
09:57 - composed of a ton of tiny discs and
09:58 - those disc rot St they are at an angle
10:00 - so your feet really only touches a tiny
10:02 - part and as you move forward they
10:04 - basically push you back to the center
10:05 - allowing you to move for Infinity one
10:07 - key benefit of this is how you can also
10:09 - have multiple people using the exact
10:10 - same threadmill at once and each person
10:12 - is walking in their own spot and also
10:14 - since these are tiny Motors they can
10:16 - also be used to just move objects now
10:18 - this looks really awesome really perfect
10:19 - for VR immersion however this is very
10:21 - much a research thing it's not an exal
10:23 - product you can buy or try anywhere but
10:25 - it is getting us one step closer to
10:26 - having a complete immersive experience
10:28 - personally I can't wait to have one of
10:29 - these in my home 10 years from now and
10:31 - go for a run on a virtual world the US
10:33 - has passed a law that forces Tik Tok to
10:35 - sell itself to a US company or get
10:36 - banned they have just nine months to
10:39 - find a buyer and if they can't or don't
10:40 - want to then technically Tik Tok could
10:42 - be banned in the US next year now
10:44 - personally I don't really use Tik Tok
10:45 - but I do know that it is massive
10:47 - especially for indie game marketing
10:48 - these past few years one of the ways
10:50 - that lots of games have found success
10:51 - has been through Tik Tok which just a
10:53 - single viral video you can get tens of
10:55 - thousands of wish lists if the ban does
10:57 - come to pass I wonder what will happen
10:58 - so well all those people move on to
11:00 - reals or YouTube shorts or will they
11:02 - stay on the non us Tik Tok from what
11:04 - I've read it seems that Tik Tok will
11:05 - really never sell its algorithm that's
11:07 - their secret sauce Tik Tok is really all
11:09 - about the algorithm and without it I'm
11:10 - not sure how much this company is worth
11:12 - but what I've also read is how in the US
11:14 - the law is really all about money and
11:15 - Tik Tok does have tons of money to fight
11:17 - this in court they've already sued the
11:18 - US government to block this Tik Tok can
11:20 - certainly afford an army of lawyers to
11:22 - either block this for sale or just delay
11:24 - it for years and years now let's move on
11:26 - to some gaming news
11:30 - H divers 2 which is a game that people
11:32 - were healing as a contender for Game of
11:33 - the Year suddenly imploded and then
11:35 - recovered although not totally now this
11:37 - is one of the biggest hits of this year
11:39 - both commercially and critically people
11:41 - Lov the game and bought tons of copies
11:43 - and then Sony for some reason months
11:45 - after release decided to throw all that
11:46 - away by forcing people to make a
11:48 - PlayStation account if they wanted to
11:49 - keep playing and that also had a
11:51 - terrible side effect players in
11:52 - countries where PSN is not supported
11:54 - suddenly cannot buy the game naturally
11:56 - people were very upset about such a
11:58 - drastic change month months after
11:59 - release and the tons of positive reviews
12:01 - for the game suddenly turned complain
12:02 - negative now the S Saga really is the
12:04 - definition of the term snatching de feed
12:06 - from the ja of Victory they had a game
12:08 - that everyone loved and sold millions of
12:09 - copies then they decided to voluntarily
12:12 - shoot themselves in the foot now the
12:13 - good news is that all of this negative
12:15 - reaction from players did have a result
12:17 - they did walk back the changes and they
12:18 - say that PSN accounts are not going to
12:20 - be required after all however this isn't
12:22 - back to normal even though there's no
12:24 - PSN link required right now the game is
12:25 - still unavailable to buy in tons of
12:27 - countries now it this seems strange to
12:29 - intentionally not sell the game even
12:30 - though there are no restrictions the CEO
12:32 - of the studio says they are talking with
12:34 - PlayStation so hopefully this w't be
12:35 - fixed soon also a fun positive fact that
12:37 - I just found out while researching this
12:39 - topic the devs behind hell divers
12:41 - Arrowhead studios are the exact same
12:43 - devs that made the excellent Magi up
12:44 - back in the day I love that game I
12:46 - always wonder why there hasn't been new
12:47 - Magi game in ages it was such a fun
12:49 - unique design and I guess this answers
12:51 - it I guess they wanted to move on to
12:53 - some different genres one of the most
12:55 - anticipated games of all time has just
12:56 - come out man and Lords this is a city
12:58 - Builder strategy Survival game it was
13:01 - one of the most wish list games on Steam
13:03 - over 3 million wish list that's an
13:04 - insane amount it very quickly sold over
13:07 - a million copies and hit Peak and
13:08 - current players of
13:10 - 173,000 that is much higher than any
13:12 - other city or Colony Builder that's
13:14 - Double D Peak for Rim world and city
13:16 - skylines so this is really a huge hit
13:18 - one of the main selling points is just
13:20 - how good the game looks it's made inre
13:22 - with some very high quality models and
13:24 - textures this has been development for
13:26 - seven years and the other main talking
13:27 - point about this game is how it's
13:29 - supposedly a solo developed game now I
13:31 - did some research and I made an entire
13:32 - video on that whole topic now
13:34 - technically it is Solo in the sense that
13:36 - there's just one employee of the studio
13:37 - working on it but that one employee is
13:39 - managing a small army of contractors so
13:42 - the question of what counts as a solid
13:43 - da is actually quite interesting since
13:45 - there's really no objective definition
13:47 - the comment section on my video has some
13:49 - really excellent discussion on what
13:50 - different people consider to be solo
13:52 - Game Dev and another highly anticipated
13:53 - game is Hades Su which has just launched
13:55 - into Early Access now the first one is
13:58 - one of my favorite games of all time I'm
14:00 - usually not much of a fan of fast
14:01 - character action games usually because I
14:03 - suck at them but I definitely loved
14:04 - Hades it's got really excellent combat
14:07 - excellent story in presentation and this
14:08 - one Hades 2 is very much more of the
14:10 - same so there's a new characters there's
14:12 - new spells new bosses new worlds it is
14:15 - out now in Early Access and has already
14:16 - hit 20,000 reviews at 94% positive
14:19 - personally I can't wait to check it out
14:21 - next year once it hits 1.0 another Hally
14:23 - successful game that just came out is
14:24 - russy's retirement now this is a nice
14:27 - itol farming game where the M Hook is
14:29 - how you play at the bottom of your
14:30 - screen so definitely an ingenious idea
14:32 - perfect for this genre people clearly
14:34 - love this the game sold over 100,000
14:36 - copies in just 5 days and there's
14:38 - actually a really funny thing about this
14:39 - game I actually mentioned this exact
14:41 - same game in My Last Game Dev report
14:43 - video and the developer is apparently
14:45 - viewer on this channel and wrote a
14:46 - comment on how the game ideas start from
14:48 - watching my transparent Unity tutorial
14:50 - video in there I talk about how you can
14:51 - make Unity transparent and put it above
14:53 - anywhere so you could for example make
14:55 - something that only occupies the bottom
14:56 - of the screen now this is really awesome
14:58 - I love love hearing stories of how
15:00 - people learn something from my videos
15:01 - and then use that knowledge to bring
15:02 - their Vision to life so to the developer
15:04 - of this game congrats on making
15:05 - something awesome that a lot of people
15:07 - love and to all of you watching I hope
15:09 - you too following the same path of
15:11 - learning various things from my videos
15:12 - and then using that knowledge to build
15:14 - your own awesome games and now let's go
15:15 - over to the quick F
15:18 - round here's a Reddit post with some
15:21 - numbers on what results you can get with
15:23 - a steam daily deal basically within
15:24 - those 48 Hours the game sold more than
15:26 - in the past 6 months combined naturally
15:29 - the hard part is actually getting the D
15:30 - Spot this one is manually curated by
15:32 - Valve the rough metric is your game
15:34 - needs to get at least 250,000 in gross
15:37 - revenue to even be considered now
15:39 - related to this topic are actually two
15:40 - excellent blog posts by Chris zakowski
15:42 - from hmarket game.com I high recommend
15:44 - you sign up to his newsletter I've
15:46 - learned a lot from it myself one post is
15:48 - on some more stats on what a daily deal
15:49 - gets you another one is on the Weekend
15:51 - Deal which is even harder to get there
15:53 - are fewer weakens and that one has the
15:55 - potential to get 10 extra results
15:57 - basically if you manage to get any of
15:58 - these slots you are going to sell a
15:59 - mountain of copies although at the same
16:01 - time in order to be considered for these
16:02 - sales you need to have already sold a
16:04 - ton now I've never had one of my games
16:06 - hit these thresholds but hopefully one
16:08 - day next here's a nice post on Twitter
16:10 - talking about how GTA 3 handled World
16:12 - streaming now I'm sure development of
16:14 - this game was fascinating from a
16:15 - technical standpoint doing so many
16:17 - things that have never been done before
16:18 - GTA 3 was really the first big open
16:20 - world 3D game with the unlimited
16:22 - Hardware at the time both in terms of
16:24 - PCS and also the PlayStation 2 the fact
16:26 - that they got it working in such limited
16:28 - Tech is really a Marvel of engineering
16:30 - he mentions how they had to put the data
16:32 - on the DVD physically together in order
16:34 - to make it a little bit more performant
16:35 - now in case you don't know how DVDs work
16:37 - they are constantly spinning and the
16:39 - data is read by a tiny head that reads
16:41 - just tiny bumps or flats in desk those
16:43 - bumps or flats correspond to either
16:44 - zeros or once so if you position data
16:46 - physically together it reduces how much
16:48 - the head needs to move in order to read
16:49 - them when dealing with such limited
16:51 - Hardware you need every trick to get you
16:53 - that tiny bit of extra performance then
16:55 - for something educational and funny
16:56 - here's a website that I just found out
16:58 - it's HTT p. dog it's a really great way
17:01 - to learn all of the HTTP codes and what
17:02 - exactly they represent I'm guessing you
17:04 - already know that 404 means not phone
17:07 - you might also know that 200 means okay
17:09 - but do you know that 41 means
17:11 - unauthorized 308 means permanent
17:13 - redirect 400 means B request 402 means
17:17 - payment required and there's actually
17:18 - more websites just like this there's one
17:20 - with cats goats ducks or pizza so this
17:22 - is a really nice and fun way to learn
17:24 - about all of the HTTP codes and to end
17:26 - on a positive note here's a funny meme
17:28 - post where I actually learned something
17:30 - new so do you know what happens if you
17:32 - round 1.5 or 2.5 now I would think that
17:35 - it would round to two and three
17:37 - respectively but nope they both round to
17:39 - two and apparently this is a thing known
17:41 - as even rounding or Bankers rounding
17:43 - which apparently is more numerically
17:44 - stable so instead of always rounding up
17:47 - for so 0. five always goes up instead of
17:49 - that it always rounds to the nearest
17:50 - even number now I've been programming
17:52 - for 25 years I've rounded tons of
17:54 - numbers but this is the first time that
17:56 - I'm hearing about this so it's a great
17:57 - example of how life is is really a
17:59 - never-ending Learning Journey and that's
18:00 - the Game Dev report for today all the
18:02 - stories are linked in the description by
18:04 - the way if you need awesome low poly
18:05 - assets there's a sale on the CN store
18:07 - right now or if you want to learn all
18:08 - about C from beginner to advance check
18:10 - out my course all right thanks for
18:12 - watching and I'll see you next time
