00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and now that we're in 2021
00:03 - let's take a look at some of the best
00:05 - unity videos of 2020.
00:07 - there were a total of 115 videos
00:10 - published covering all sorts of topics
00:12 - everything from simple tutorials to
00:14 - machine learning effects game
00:16 - analysis complete courses and much much
00:17 - more
00:18 - i made a really nice page with the more
00:20 - interesting videos grouped into a bunch
00:22 - of categories
00:22 - check that out if you want to browse
00:24 - these videos in your own time there's
00:26 - too many awesome ones for me to mention
00:27 - in just this video
00:29 - the year actually started off quite well
00:31 - back in january the channel hit 100 000
00:33 - subscribers
00:34 - so thank you all for that and i really
00:36 - hope you've learned a ton from all of
00:38 - these videos
00:38 - then a video that took a massive amount
00:40 - of work to make my game dev journey
00:43 - in there i talk about how i started
00:44 - programming 20 years ago making irc
00:46 - scripts
00:47 - then i moved on to flash and finally to
00:49 - unity i'm really happy with that video
00:51 - it's a really nice summary of all the
00:53 - projects that i've done in all that time
00:55 - it was a total of over 40 games and it
00:58 - should also serve as an inspiration to
00:59 - you to take your own time on your own
01:01 - journey and just focus on getting better
01:03 - day by day
01:04 - then when the whole thing of 2020
01:06 - started i made a video on my tips from
01:08 - working from home
01:09 - i've been working from home for many
01:11 - many years now so if you're just
01:12 - starting hopefully my tips can help you
01:15 - then for a really interesting complete
01:16 - game named wash your hands
01:18 - this was obviously very topical at the
01:21 - time and it was also the very first time
01:22 - that i experimented making a 3d video i
01:26 - mainly stick with 2d since making
01:27 - textures is easier than 3d
01:29 - meshes but i had some asset packs laying
01:31 - around so that's what i used
01:33 - it's an interesting minigame you go
01:35 - around clearing up all the nasty
01:37 - particles while telling people to wash
01:38 - their hands
01:39 - and visually i'm quite pleased with the
01:41 - end result some really good looking 3d
01:43 - world with some flat sprites and
01:45 - lots and lots of effects i made a bunch
01:47 - more complete games
01:48 - one of them was i made doom in unity it
01:51 - was great to remake one of the old time
01:53 - classics and make it work exactly like
01:55 - the original
01:56 - another one was a simple match 3 game i
01:59 - needed this for a video that i was
02:00 - planning so i made it from scratch in
02:02 - just under 6 hours and recorded the
02:04 - whole thing
02:05 - and i also participated in the mixing
02:07 - game jam where i made a really
02:08 - interesting racing rts
02:10 - in just 48 hours as the name implies
02:12 - it's a mix of racing and rts where you
02:14 - drive around the car and also control a
02:16 - bunch of other car units
02:17 - it's a very unique design speaking of
02:20 - complete games
02:20 - this year was also when i launched the
02:22 - code monkey steam app
02:24 - i've been thinking about doing something
02:26 - like this for ages and finally i managed
02:28 - to do it
02:28 - i wanted something to group all the
02:30 - videos and all the games that i've made
02:32 - into one nice complete package and
02:33 - that's exactly what it is
02:35 - it's completely free so we'll go ahead
02:37 - pick it up on steam it includes all of
02:39 - the various games that i've made on the
02:40 - channel
02:41 - like the wash your hands game that i
02:42 - just mentioned so you can easily get the
02:44 - app and play through all those games
02:46 - it also has some really interesting
02:48 - interactive tutorials
02:50 - it's a nice minigame that teaches you c
02:52 - sharp and unity as well as game design
02:54 - also looks really good with some nice
02:56 - assets and on the app there's also a
02:58 - section for my own steam games and more
03:00 - importantly they have a list of the
03:02 - various tutorial videos that i've made
03:04 - where i remade some of those elements so
03:06 - for example you can go and play my steam
03:08 - games and then go watch those videos to
03:10 - see how those systems were made
03:12 - really interesting stuff as for unit
03:14 - tools and features i also covered a
03:16 - bunch of them
03:17 - i made a simple video on unt analytics
03:20 - definitely something you should use when
03:21 - making your own games
03:22 - another one on game simulation which is
03:24 - a very interesting tool that lets you
03:26 - run your game
03:27 - tons and tons of times on the cloud in
03:29 - parallel
03:30 - it's very useful for testing your game
03:32 - thousands of times and coming up with
03:33 - the perfect balance levels
03:35 - i also made a video on the visual effect
03:37 - graph this is how you can exploit the
03:39 - power of the gpu to render millions and
03:40 - millions of particles
03:42 - i did a general overview and then a nice
03:44 - scatter effect and finally near the end
03:47 - of the year i got into machine learning
03:48 - using unity ml agents
03:50 - this is a fascinating toolkit that is
03:52 - actually very easy to use and gives you
03:54 - the full power of machine learning
03:56 - i cover the basics of machine learning
03:58 - then how to use imitation learning
04:00 - and how to teach in ai how to play
04:02 - flappy bird and drive a car
04:04 - machine learning has a massive amount of
04:06 - potential so definitely and look forward
04:07 - to some more videos on how you can use
04:09 - this tool to help you make better games
04:12 - back in march i made a ton of dots
04:14 - videos
04:16 - covering physics lists prefabs events
04:18 - and subscenes
04:19 - i implemented pathfinding in dots and i
04:21 - even made an awesome video on how you
04:23 - can combine super fast dots pathfinding
04:25 - with normal game objects
04:27 - that was really awesome and insanely
04:29 - fast so back then i covered lots of
04:31 - topics and i even made a complete game
04:33 - internally using dots
04:34 - just to showcase how it was already very
04:36 - capable at the time
04:37 - i haven't been back to using dots since
04:39 - then but based on how good it was
04:41 - already a year ago i can't wait to try
04:43 - it again
04:43 - i also experimented with a different
04:45 - type of video watching some popular
04:47 - aaa games and analyzing their trailers
04:49 - to see how all of those mechanics are
04:51 - made
04:52 - start off with the very first video
04:53 - analyzing the watch dogs trailer looking
04:56 - at all the mechanics shown in the
04:57 - trailer and teaching you how you could
04:59 - build them in your own games
05:01 - then i analyzed the spiderman trailer
05:03 - which is full of solid mechanics to
05:04 - learn from
05:05 - and then ghost of tsushima which really
05:07 - has some interesting sound mechanics
05:09 - visual effects and a hook shot this is
05:11 - an interesting format that i definitely
05:13 - want to keep doing
05:14 - the only issue with this is that it
05:16 - requires me to find some good gameplay
05:18 - trailer that showcases a bunch of things
05:20 - usually those trailers come out at e3
05:22 - and since there was no e3 last year that
05:24 - kind of limits things
05:25 - but there's lots of awesome ones from
05:27 - previous years so i'll probably be
05:28 - looking at those
05:29 - game design is really a timeless
05:31 - discipline so you can learn just as much
05:33 - from older titles as well as from new
05:35 - ones
05:35 - and in december when cyberpunk launched
05:37 - i did another similar experiment
05:39 - except instead of watching the trailer i
05:41 - played through the game and selected a
05:43 - bunch of mechanics to then go remake in
05:45 - unity
05:46 - this format has the benefit that i don't
05:47 - need to find the perfect official
05:49 - gameplay trailer i can just play the
05:50 - game myself
05:52 - the goal with this was to show you how
05:53 - these aaa games look impossibly complex
05:56 - but many of the things they do you can
05:57 - definitely do them for yourself in unity
05:59 - and remaking those mechanics was a lot
06:01 - of fun so this is also a format that i
06:03 - intend to keep doing
06:04 - as for tutorials there were obviously
06:06 - tons of them one of the main reasons why
06:08 - i started this channel was to share my
06:10 - knowledge with all of you and also
06:11 - because i wanted to explore tons of
06:13 - different topics and continue on my own
06:15 - learning journey
06:16 - so with that one really awesome
06:17 - mini-series was on a crafting system
06:20 - back in 2019 i made an inventory system
06:22 - and then in 2020 i made a minecraft like
06:25 - crafting system built on top of it
06:27 - it works exactly as you expect drag the
06:29 - recipe in the correct position and drag
06:30 - the output item
06:31 - later i made a video on scriptable
06:33 - objects this is how you can define a
06:35 - data structure to create individual
06:37 - objects to hold some data
06:38 - i also made a video on custom inspectors
06:40 - with custom fields
06:42 - images buttons and so on and finally i
06:44 - combined everything and made the
06:46 - crafting system with scriptable objects
06:47 - and a custom editor
06:49 - it's super easy and very visual to
06:51 - create a completely brand new item and
06:53 - define a brand new recipe for how to
06:55 - make it
06:56 - i'm really happy with the final result
06:58 - on this one definitely need to use it
06:59 - more often in some more videos
07:01 - i made a shadowgraph overview video just
07:03 - teaching the basics for how it works
07:05 - and then some tutorial videos on
07:06 - interesting effects one of them
07:08 - on a simple grassland shader it makes
07:11 - the sprite deform in such a way that it
07:12 - looks like wind
07:14 - and another one for a really awesome
07:15 - building construction effect
07:17 - i really need an effect like this for my
07:19 - course and this is what i came up with
07:21 - i really like how it looks it seems as
07:23 - if the building is being printed
07:24 - line by line really cool also related to
07:27 - shadowgraph i made a video on how to use
07:29 - the shadow graph to make custom pose
07:31 - processing effects
07:32 - so every effect that i've already
07:33 - covered like for example the solve can
07:35 - be applied to tone on screen
07:37 - one really interesting video was on
07:38 - converting 2d into 3d and vice versa
07:41 - i've made a lot of videos using 2ds demo
07:44 - because it's simply easier for me to
07:46 - draw sprites than make meshes but for
07:48 - the most part
07:48 - all of my videos work both in 2d and 3d
07:52 - but i do see that comment a lot going
07:54 - into something like the inventory system
07:56 - video and asking if it works in 3d
07:58 - so i made this video to showcase how
08:00 - easy it is to convert systems between 2d
08:02 - and 3d
08:03 - it's usually very very easy there were a
08:06 - bunch of videos regarding enemies
08:08 - starting off with a simple ai just
08:10 - teaching how to use a basic state
08:12 - machine to make some sort of basic enemy
08:14 - logic
08:15 - then a battle system for spawning
08:16 - enemies when the player gets near
08:18 - or triggers some sort of condition i
08:20 - made a really awesome boss fight
08:22 - again using a state machine to define an
08:24 - interesting boss battle with various
08:26 - stages
08:27 - also made a melee combat system that
08:29 - features smart targeting so it knows
08:31 - which target it should prioritize
08:33 - and the video covering several methods
08:35 - for how to find targets
08:36 - pick the one that best suits your needs
08:38 - also related was the video on various
08:40 - methods for shooting projectiles
08:42 - all of them with pros and cons it all
08:44 - depends on what projectile you're trying
08:46 - to simulate
08:47 - then i made two player controllers one
08:49 - of them very standard just a normal
08:51 - top-down player controller
08:52 - you can move around that has physics and
08:54 - collisions and so on it even features an
08:56 - instant dash and nice nodule
08:58 - this is the standard controller that i
09:00 - use in most of my top-down videos
09:02 - and another really interesting one based
09:04 - on a modular design
09:06 - so the whole thing is based on building
09:07 - several modules that then work on top of
09:09 - each other
09:10 - you can use a module that just has some
09:12 - dumb movement or easily swap it out for
09:14 - one that uses pathfinding
09:16 - use one for player control or swap it
09:18 - out for one with enemy ai
09:19 - it's a really interesting design and by
09:21 - going through it you will learn a ton of
09:23 - things like using c-sharp interface
09:25 - for some more ai i also made a simple
09:27 - tower defense ai
09:29 - place down towers and have them target
09:30 - enemies then a video on a simple rts
09:33 - control system
09:34 - i definitely would like to make some
09:35 - more rts videos as soon as i have the
09:37 - time
09:38 - and if you're a fan of games like xcom i
09:40 - made an awesome grid combat system
09:43 - its turn base features two different
09:45 - teams and it's based on a grid
09:46 - it's a great starting point for any
09:48 - strategy game i made a video on using
09:50 - several methods of interacting with
09:52 - objects
09:53 - using a button position item and so on i
09:56 - show it being used on a door but really
09:57 - they can be used for any object
09:59 - then for some more general videos i made
10:02 - one on the math behind splines and how
10:04 - you can make some really awesome smooth
10:06 - shapes
10:06 - you can then use them to move a car
10:08 - around or make some roads or really just
10:10 - any smooth curve
10:11 - somewhat related to that is the video on
10:13 - animation curves and how you can use
10:15 - them for so much more than just
10:17 - animation
10:18 - one video on a simple chat bubble this
10:20 - is the example like i used in my game
10:22 - battleground tycoon
10:23 - a really great video on animated cursors
10:26 - so this one is exactly what i use
10:27 - in my survivor squad games and i also
10:30 - made a tone tip that works perfectly
10:32 - always
10:32 - is on screen and follows the mouse then
10:34 - a video on how to make unity as a
10:36 - transparent window
10:37 - this was a lot of fun to research you
10:39 - can essentially do anything you can with
10:41 - unity and use it as an overlay on top of
10:43 - your desktop
10:44 - one example was i made a simple
10:46 - assistant like the ones that existed
10:48 - back in the 90s
10:49 - this is also how i made the annotation
10:51 - program that i then used in the game dev
10:53 - reacts videos
10:54 - and another interesting one was in
10:56 - making a launcher
10:57 - you make a unity program that then
10:59 - launches other programs
11:01 - so this one is pretty much exactly how
11:02 - my cmap works it's a hub for all the
11:05 - other projects that i've made
11:06 - there were a bunch of c sharp focused
11:08 - videos first of all
11:10 - very quick video showcasing c sharp
11:12 - basics in just 10 minutes
11:13 - it gives you a great overview of the
11:15 - language then some videos going in-depth
11:17 - on various c-sharp topics
11:19 - one on the basics of loops the various
11:21 - types you have and how each differ from
11:23 - each other
11:24 - a video on events and how they help you
11:26 - keep your code clean and nicely
11:28 - decoupled
11:29 - also a video on delegates which lets you
11:31 - store a function inside a field
11:33 - very useful one covering interfaces
11:36 - which lets you define
11:37 - certain behavior on your types like for
11:39 - example having an interface for every
11:41 - object that can be
11:42 - damaged and one on generics which are
11:44 - insanely useful
11:45 - then let you write code that works with
11:47 - any class so this is extensively used in
11:50 - my grid class
11:52 - and finally i made a super useful video
11:54 - on my process for solving the very
11:55 - common error of null reference
11:57 - exceptions
11:58 - in there i mentioned my step-by-step
12:00 - process for how i always solve that
12:01 - error
12:02 - if you go through all those videos you
12:04 - will certainly learn a ton about c-sharp
12:05 - and program
12:06 - and as i've already mentioned i made
12:08 - tons of dots videos and machine learning
12:10 - tutorials
12:11 - so yep in 2020 there were tons of topics
12:14 - covered this year
12:15 - everything from simple to complex some
12:17 - based on programming
12:18 - others based on rendering others on game
12:20 - design and various unity tools
12:22 - i'd definitely love to hear from you
12:24 - which ones you found most useful
12:26 - this year was also when i finally
12:27 - decided to try making some complete
12:29 - courses
12:30 - i've wanted for a long time to do some
12:32 - complete courses essentially they allow
12:33 - me to cover a lot more and speak about a
12:35 - lot more things that i just can't fit in
12:37 - a 20 minute video
12:39 - so with that in mind i first made the
12:40 - bundler defender course
12:42 - i'm really happy with the final result
12:44 - you can definitely learn a ton which is
12:45 - applicable to a lot of genres like city
12:47 - builders tower defense survival games
12:49 - and so on
12:50 - the course starts completely from
12:52 - scratch the very first video is on
12:53 - creating a brand new empty project
12:55 - and it goes step by step until the final
12:58 - completed game
12:59 - it's around 20 hours so i can definitely
13:01 - go into a lot more depth than in my
13:02 - normal videos
13:03 - all of the lectures have their own
13:05 - project files as downloadable resources
13:07 - so you can start from the beginning or
13:08 - pick up from anywhere you want
13:10 - this was my first course essentially
13:12 - showcasing making a game
13:13 - exactly the way that i make my own games
13:15 - using code
13:16 - but then i also made another massive
13:18 - course this one all about making games
13:20 - internally using visual scripting
13:22 - i specifically designed the course to
13:23 - include not one but three games
13:25 - in order to cover lots of different
13:27 - genres this was an interesting challenge
13:29 - and it definitely showed me how it is
13:31 - absolutely possible to build anything
13:33 - you want using solely visual scripting
13:35 - the action rpg and the fps are some
13:37 - pretty complex games and they all work
13:39 - perfectly without a single line of code
13:41 - and just like the builder defender
13:42 - course this one also starts completely
13:44 - from scratch and contains all the
13:46 - downloadable project files for
13:48 - all the unlectures so all in all i'm
13:50 - really happy with those two courses and
13:51 - based on the reviews it seems that
13:53 - people like them as well
13:54 - i definitely want to do some more
13:55 - although they do take a massive amount
13:57 - of time so it won't be a while before
13:59 - the next one
13:59 - speaking of courses i also made an
14:01 - interesting video comparing the pros and
14:03 - cons of free tutorials versus paid
14:05 - courses
14:05 - in there i talk about the various
14:07 - differences and how courses are better
14:09 - for
14:09 - learning all the tiny things that no one
14:11 - mentions in a normal tutorial
14:13 - and i also talk about how tutorials are
14:15 - excellent if you already know what
14:16 - you're looking for
14:17 - it's a really great video and i'd
14:19 - encourage you to check it out if you
14:20 - haven't already there's tons of benefits
14:22 - to both types if you know how to use
14:24 - them
14:24 - alright so that was the year 2020. tons
14:27 - of awesome stuff with 115 videos in
14:29 - total
14:30 - check the page on the website which
14:32 - contains links to all of these videos
14:33 - and a bunch more
14:34 - there might be some there that you may
14:36 - not have seen and you might find quite
14:37 - useful
14:38 - i'd love to hear from you which ones you
14:40 - found the most useful
14:41 - thank you all for continuing to watch
14:43 - the videos i really hope you've learned
14:44 - a ton from them and i hope to continue
14:46 - making content that you find
14:48 - educational and entertaining this video
14:50 - is made possible thanks to these awesome
14:52 - supporters
14:53 - go to patreon.com unitycodemonkey to get
14:55 - some perks and help keep the videos free
14:57 - for everyone
14:58 - so again thank you all so much for
15:00 - watching and i'll see you next time
