00:00 - UA host Court dos reveal epic CEO's
00:03 - anger at seams 30% fees so this is an
00:05 - interesting email from the CEO of Epic
00:07 - that has just been revealed it has to do
00:09 - with the valve wfire lawsuit that has
00:11 - been going on for quite some time now I
00:13 - first heard about it on the game
00:14 - discover code newsletter basically this
00:16 - lawsuit has to do with selling steam
00:17 - keys and how valve is enforcing pricing
00:19 - parody and anyways whenever there's a
00:21 - lawsuit there's the discovery phase
00:23 - where all kinds of things become public
00:25 - in this case internal valve data and
00:26 - emails are part of this suit and from
00:28 - that came this email and S off with an
00:30 - email from Gabe new to Tim Sweeny of
00:32 - Epic where he just said anything we
00:33 - doing to annoy you T which Tim replies
00:35 - how generally the economics of the 30%
00:37 - platform fees are no longer justifiable
00:39 - how there was a good case for them in
00:41 - the early days but the scale is now high
00:42 - and operation costs have been driven
00:44 - down while the turn of new game releases
00:46 - so fast that the brief marketing or UA
00:48 - value the storefront provides is far
00:50 - disproportionate to the fee and then one
00:51 - interesting slightly depressing stat if
00:54 - you subtract out the top 25 games for
00:56 - scam I bet valve made more profit from
00:58 - most of the next 1,000 and developers
01:00 - themselves made that's definitely a
01:01 - pretty depressing stat it simply comes
01:03 - from the case that so many games are
01:05 - unprofitable whereas valve themselves by
01:07 - now their business is definitely
01:08 - extremely profitable so when a developer
01:10 - puts a game on Steam steam themselves
01:12 - make money right away whereas the
01:13 - developer first needs to recoup death
01:15 - costs and over here Tim goes on to say
01:17 - how Val takes 30% for distribution then
01:19 - they have to spend 30% on Facebook
01:21 - Google Twitter for UA user acquisition
01:24 - or traditional marketing 10% on servic
01:26 - cost 5% on engine so the system takes
01:29 - 75% and that leaves 25% for actually
01:31 - creating the game worse than retail
01:33 - distribution economics in the '90s and
01:35 - for a bit of context this email is
01:37 - actually dated back in 2017 this was
01:39 - actually before they had the epic game
01:41 - store at the time Paragon was still
01:43 - alive and fortnite was still in its
01:45 - infancy considering how much it has
01:47 - grown since then he continues so I
01:48 - believe the question of why distribution
01:50 - still takes 30% on the open PC platform
01:52 - on the open internet is a healthy topic
01:54 - for public discourse now I do think the
01:56 - 30% this topic is definitely worthy of
01:58 - being discussed whether it's fair not in
02:00 - today's age especially considering what
02:02 - he mentions on how nowadays there are so
02:04 - many games coming out that steam doesn't
02:05 - really give you that much visibility by
02:07 - default I'll tell you my own thoughts on
02:08 - this debate in a little bit I have
02:10 - something of a hot take on this topic
02:11 - but I'm hoping you'll help me out so
02:13 - these are definitely some interesting
02:14 - points however this is not the angry
02:16 - email this is the much more tame one the
02:19 - second email was still somewhat tame
02:20 - this was on November 26 2018 so about a
02:22 - year after that one so on this one team
02:24 - Sweeny revealed to G new how on December
02:26 - 4th or 5th epic will announce a new
02:28 - store host on Epic games.com so the epic
02:30 - game store they announc that with a
02:32 - permanent 88 12% Revenue split
02:34 - definitely much more generous than the
02:35 - 30% that seam takes they mention how
02:37 - they're going to launch it publish it on
02:39 - the game awards how the store is engine
02:41 - agnostic so any engine supposedly can
02:42 - work on the store this all also happened
02:44 - before the epic games versus Apple
02:46 - lawsuit where they updated their IOS app
02:49 - in order to bypass Apple's fees they
02:50 - basically included the link where you
02:52 - could buy v-bucks directly from their
02:53 - own website which would mean they don't
02:55 - have to pay app on their 30% cut that's
02:57 - what eventually triggered this lawsuit
02:59 - but anyways all of this happened before
03:00 - that and over here back in 2018 Tim was
03:03 - already thinking about that and it was
03:05 - exactly based on this that he sent the
03:06 - message to gab new apparently on this
03:08 - email his goal was to actually ask valve
03:10 - to modify their own steam cut and in
03:12 - doing so basically Prov that things can
03:14 - work with lower cut which in turn would
03:16 - put pressure on Apple to lower their cut
03:17 - as well what it mentions here what we
03:19 - need right now is enough developer press
03:21 - and platform momentum to sear Apple
03:22 - towards fully opening up the iOS sooner
03:24 - rather than later a timely move by Valve
03:26 - to improve steam's economics for all
03:28 - developers would make a great difference
03:30 - and all of this clearly demonstrating
03:31 - that store competition leads to better
03:33 - rates for all developers epic would
03:35 - gladly speak in support of such a move
03:37 - anytime conversely if valve made
03:39 - unannounced Revenue sharing changes that
03:41 - favored big Publishers over Indies the
03:43 - implication would be that software
03:44 - distribution economics ought to be
03:46 - defined by negotiating power in backro
03:47 - deals between companies in that world
03:49 - companies like apple can keep their
03:51 - closed platforms and just pay off big
03:53 - Publishers to St Island not good and
03:54 - this line is actually really interesting
03:56 - talking about unannounced Revenue
03:58 - sharing changes that favored big public
04:00 - over Indies it's kind of interesting how
04:02 - this is from an email apparently titled
04:03 - from November 26 2018 and then in
04:06 - December 1st 2018 on that day steam
04:08 - announced this so new Revenue shared te
04:10 - and other updates with steam
04:11 - distribution agreement basically this is
04:13 - doing exactly that so basically it's
04:14 - giving a much better deal to Big
04:16 - Publishers as opposed to small Indies so
04:18 - like it says here we've created new
04:19 - Revenue shareed tiers for games that hit
04:21 - certain Revenue levels starting from
04:23 - October 1st 2018 when a game makes over
04:25 - $10 million on seam the revenue share
04:27 - for that application will adjust to 7520
04:29 - 25 as opposed to 7030 on earnings Beyond
04:32 - 10 million at 50 million the revenue
04:34 - share will adjust to 8020 on earnings
04:36 - Beyond 50 million and all this Revenue
04:38 - includes game packages DLC and game
04:39 - sales and so on our hope is this change
04:41 - will reward the positive Network effect
04:43 - generated by developers of big games
04:45 - figing their interests with steam and
04:47 - the community this was definitely an
04:48 - interesting change and pretty much the
04:50 - opposite of what most people wanted
04:51 - obviously with myself being an indie
04:53 - game developer I would prefer to see
04:54 - this going the other way so basically
04:56 - taking a lower cut from smaller Indies
04:57 - as opposed to giving a much better deal
04:59 - to already massive corporations but then
05:01 - again valve is a for-profit company so
05:03 - while it does suck from their point of
05:05 - view of just making as much money as
05:06 - possible obviously this makes more sense
05:08 - and then we get to the really angry
05:10 - email from December 3rd 2018 so over
05:12 - here team Sweeney talks about the
05:14 - announcement going live tomorrow that is
05:15 - the announcement talking about the Epic
05:16 - gam store and how that's finally going
05:18 - live and he mentions how later this week
05:20 - we'll be escalating a conversation with
05:22 - apple the issue was about the iOS
05:23 - platform fee so the question of open
05:25 - platforms and store economics will be
05:27 - foremost on Apple exx mines this week I
05:30 - believe the best outcome can be achieved
05:31 - if Apple speedily concludes that the
05:33 - combination of an app store Monopoly and
05:35 - 30% fees is untenable and that opening
05:37 - iOS up is the best stoploss strategy
05:39 - then here comes the really part right
05:41 - now UA holes are telling the world that
05:43 - the strong and powerful get special
05:44 - terms so that's that special deal while
05:47 - 30% is for the little people we're all
05:49 - in for a prolonged battle if Apple tries
05:50 - to keep their Monopoly and 30% by
05:52 - cutting back room deals with big
05:53 - Publishers to keep them quiet which by
05:55 - the way spell alert is what has happened
05:57 - since then so why not give all
05:58 - developers a better deal what better way
06:00 - is there to convince Apple quickly that
06:02 - their model is now totally untenable so
06:04 - yeah team was definitely very angry
06:05 - about having to pay 30% to both Apple
06:08 - Google valve whatever he feels that it's
06:10 - way too much and especially considering
06:11 - how much money fortnite makes I can
06:13 - imagine how difference between 10% and
06:15 - 30% are millions and millions of dollars
06:17 - however on this topic I have I guess
06:19 - what is a little bit of a hot take this
06:21 - whole argument makes it seem like seam
06:22 - does absolutely nothing 200 30% and
06:25 - going back to his argument on how there
06:26 - are so many new game releases and based
06:28 - on that the very brief Market that you
06:29 - get from launching a new game on Steam
06:31 - that one does not seem worth the cost
06:33 - however I would argue as both a
06:34 - developer and a player steam is still
06:36 - extremely valuable it already has a huge
06:37 - Library it's already really easy to use
06:39 - it's got user reviews which are Super
06:41 - useful there are Community forums
06:43 - there's a place to add some really
06:44 - useful guides you have the Steam
06:46 - Workshop which is really awesome for so
06:48 - many games by comparison the Epic gam
06:49 - store doesn't have all of that even
06:51 - after all this time you can ask any
06:53 - player and they won't tell you that they
06:54 - much prefer steam because it is
06:55 - objectively just a better service and as
06:57 - a developer is simply the case that seam
06:59 - is is really massive with millions of
07:01 - monthly active users the price access
07:02 - those users which steam has gathered for
07:04 - the past 20 years by building their
07:06 - ecosystem the price ACC is this massive
07:08 - audience the price that they defined is
07:09 - 30% so personally given all that as a
07:12 - developer well obviously I wish the 30%
07:14 - cut was much lower if they lowered it
07:15 - from 30 to 10% that would be objectively
07:18 - a great thing however even at 30% I
07:20 - still think that it's a good deal and
07:21 - let me say why back when I made my first
07:23 - game in 2012 Survivor Squad back then I
07:26 - finished the game in about six months so
07:27 - around July of 2013 back then I finished
07:30 - the game and I put it up for sale
07:31 - directly on my own website and as you
07:33 - might expect selling a game directly on
07:35 - a unknown game website the final result
07:37 - was maybe like 10 copies sold in a first
07:39 - week obviously that's not really great
07:41 - back then Steam Greenlight was still a
07:43 - thing so over many months I was
07:45 - gathering votes and hoping to finally
07:46 - get on Steam and when I finally did on
07:48 - the first week I sold something like
07:49 - 1,000 copies so that really is the
07:51 - massive difference between posting your
07:53 - game on your own a website that no one
07:54 - knows or going onto a platform like
07:56 - steam that has over 20 years of
07:59 - gathering players from all kinds of
08:00 - games and if you just put a game on seam
08:02 - you are potentially exposed to a massive
08:04 - huge audience so this is really the AG
08:06 - on question do you prefer to keep a high
08:08 - percentage of a smaller number or a
08:10 - lower percentage of a much much bigger
08:11 - number value is really always subjective
08:14 - 30% can be a low or a high number but
08:16 - personally I don't necessarily see it as
08:18 - an unfair number the reason for that is
08:19 - simply because I've seen what happens
08:21 - when I get 100% of the revenue but try
08:22 - to sell to a tiny tiny audience the
08:25 - results were really not good I would not
08:26 - be doing Game Dev as living if I could
08:28 - only sound directly on my my website
08:30 - whereas over here on seam I can pay 30%
08:32 - to access the massive seam audience
08:34 - alongside their very robust ecosystem so
08:36 - personally given what I've experience
08:37 - myself I do think that steam is
08:39 - definitely quite valuable and I do think
08:41 - the entire ecosystem is worth the cost
08:43 - maybe 30% is a bit High maybe it should
08:45 - be 20% instead like I said value is
08:47 - subjective but I do disagree with the
08:49 - notion that some people like Tim
08:50 - compared steam to just a payment
08:52 - processor like Visa or Mastercard those
08:54 - payment processors usually take a 3 to
08:56 - 5% fee seem is worth a lot more because
08:58 - does a lot more more than just Payment
09:00 - Processing if you just Implement a Visa
09:02 - widget on your own website if you do
09:04 - that you don't really get any access to
09:06 - any audience whereas on Steam you get
09:08 - access to a massive audience and tons of
09:09 - tools that have helped me personally
09:11 - make a living from my indie games for
09:13 - the past 10 years so while of course I
09:14 - wish they would lower their cut to make
09:16 - something much better despite that if
09:17 - seam did not exist and I would not be
09:19 - doing this as a job so that is why even
09:21 - though I do wish the cut was lower even
09:23 - so I still think that being on Steam is
09:24 - objectively a good thing so we'll see
09:26 - one day change how Revenue works if I
09:28 - had to guess I would say probably not
09:30 - like I said they are a for-profit
09:31 - company so while technically the best
09:33 - thing would be to do the opposite of
09:34 - what they did meaning take a much lower
09:36 - cut from super small Indies in order to
09:38 - have those Indies who barely have enough
09:40 - money to be able to keep a little bit
09:41 - more if the goal is to make as much
09:43 - money as possible then obviously what
09:44 - they did is objectively the right move
09:46 - so personally if I was gab new if I was
09:48 - the billionaire owner of seam that's
09:49 - exactly what I would do I would
09:51 - definitely lower the cut in order to
09:52 - make it pretty much 0% from let's say
09:54 - the first $10,000 I think that would be
09:57 - really awesome for supporting Indie devs
09:58 - but see is a massive company and really
10:00 - their main goal is just make money so I
10:02 - really don't expect that to change
10:03 - anytime soon but do let me know in the
10:05 - comments what do you think about the 30%
10:07 - seam cut and importantly let me know
10:08 - what do you think about the cut and if
10:10 - you have ever tried publishing games off
10:12 - steam I think that's a really important
10:14 - point because obviously lower would be
10:15 - better but if you've tried selling games
10:17 - off steam then you've probably seen the
10:18 - value there is of being on Steam
