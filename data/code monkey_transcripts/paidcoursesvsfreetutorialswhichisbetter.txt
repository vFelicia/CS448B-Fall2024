00:00 - in this video i'm going to explore the
00:01 - question of paid courses versus free
00:03 - tutorials
00:04 - depending on what your goals are one
00:06 - might be better than the other or both
00:07 - can provide you with tons of educational
00:09 - value
00:10 - let's begin
00:11 - [Music]
00:15 - this video is sponsored by skillshare
00:17 - skillshare is an online learning
00:19 - community with thousands of classes on
00:20 - just about any topic
00:22 - explore new skills and improve your
00:23 - current ones at your own pace with
00:25 - unlimited access to thousands of
00:27 - inspiring classes for every skill level
00:29 - learn skills related to game development
00:31 - like the basics of computer science
00:33 - then learn modeling in blender by making
00:35 - your very first 3d character
00:37 - and then learn the basics of animation
00:39 - with all the important principles of
00:40 - squash and stretch timing and so on
00:42 - being a subscription means you don't
00:44 - have to buy each class individually
00:46 - so for less than ten dollars a month
00:48 - with the annual subscription you have
00:50 - full access to all the classes you could
00:51 - possibly want
00:52 - with so many classes available you can
00:54 - learn skills related to game development
00:56 - but also improve on any hobbies you have
00:58 - for example learn how to play the guitar
01:01 - learn electronics with a
01:02 - arduino and a raspberry pi or learn how
01:04 - to be more productive in life
01:06 - join now with the link in the
01:07 - description and for a limited time the

01:13 - thanks to skillshare for supporting the
01:14 - video and supporting the channel alright
01:16 - so as you may know i very recently
01:18 - launched my very first course over the
01:20 - past two years i've made over 300 free
01:22 - video tutorials on this channel and now
01:24 - i have one paid course
01:26 - so with that one interesting question
01:28 - comes to mind which is better for
01:29 - learning courses or tutorials so let's
01:32 - first define the terms as i'm using them
01:35 - so a course is a several hours long
01:37 - guided journey on making a very specific
01:39 - thing
01:40 - for example a complete game completely
01:42 - from start to finish covering in detail
01:44 - every step of the process
01:45 - in a tutorial is a short video covering
01:48 - a single system or element
01:50 - for example making a tooltip or a health
01:52 - system the way i see it they both
01:54 - provide great value but it depends on
01:55 - what you're trying to do
01:57 - the main benefit of a course is it
01:59 - provides you with a guided path
02:01 - so you start from the first lecture then
02:03 - build upon it on the second lecture and
02:05 - so on
02:05 - the main thing that the core sells is
02:07 - really convenience instead of thinking
02:09 - of all the elements you need to make a
02:11 - game and then looking for all these
02:12 - separate tutorials on each of those
02:14 - specific topics
02:15 - you just get a course and follow it from
02:17 - start to finish doing that can be much
02:19 - much easier especially if you're a
02:21 - beginner and don't even know what
02:22 - questions to ask or what elements your
02:24 - game needs
02:25 - a good course will have all the content
02:27 - planned out where one lecture
02:28 - leads into the next one and covers all
02:30 - the systems required to reach the final
02:31 - goal
02:32 - whereas with tutorials you need to first
02:34 - find all the tutorials for all the
02:36 - elements you need to make up your game
02:37 - and then another important thing is you
02:39 - need to think about how to connect the
02:40 - various systems and elements together
02:42 - i see a lot of comments in my videos of
02:44 - people having this exact same problem
02:46 - they see one of my videos for example on
02:48 - a system like pathfinding
02:50 - but then they don't know exactly how to
02:52 - apply that on top of another system like
02:53 - for example the enemy ai
02:55 - handling that connection is very
02:57 - specific to whatever systems you're
02:58 - trying to connect so it's not something
03:00 - that can be covered in general tutorial
03:02 - but a good course will handle it in a
03:04 - good way
03:05 - for example in my builder defender game
03:07 - course i go through the creation of the
03:09 - resource manager which handles all the
03:10 - resources that the player has
03:12 - then i also go through the creation of
03:14 - the building manager that handles how
03:16 - the buildings are constructed
03:17 - and then i go through the connection of
03:19 - those two systems in order to make the
03:20 - buildings cost some resources before
03:22 - they can be constructed
03:24 - if i were to make a tutorial on the
03:25 - resource manager and another one on the
03:27 - building manager
03:28 - you would need to watch both of those
03:29 - and then figure out for yourself how to
03:31 - connect them together
03:32 - so a complete course really helps you
03:34 - learn how all the systems come together
03:36 - in order to make a complete final game
03:38 - another benefit of going through a
03:40 - complete course is there are lots of
03:41 - tiny things that are too small to be
03:43 - mentioned
03:44 - in an individual video however i can
03:46 - mention them as i come across those
03:47 - various issues during the course
03:49 - for example it is a good practice to
03:51 - keep your data grouped inside a proper
03:53 - class if all that data represents just
03:55 - one concept
03:57 - so in the builder defender game i made a
03:59 - class to hold the generated data that
04:01 - defines how fast each object generates
04:03 - and what type of resource
04:04 - it generates and in doing so i came
04:07 - across the issue where if you make a
04:08 - custom class it will not show up on the
04:10 - editor by default
04:12 - now the fix to this is really simple you
04:13 - just need to add the attribute
04:15 - system.serializable
04:16 - if you do then you can see your custom
04:18 - classes in the editor so that's an
04:20 - example of a tiny thing that i couldn't
04:22 - really make into a separate video since
04:23 - it's so small but still it's very
04:25 - important and very valuable knowledge to
04:27 - have
04:27 - another example is how when i need to
04:29 - drag a bunch of game object references
04:31 - onto a list
04:32 - in there i talk about how you can lock
04:34 - the inspector and just drag them all
04:35 - directly inside of one by one
04:37 - and yet another example is when i talk
04:39 - about using private serialized fields
04:41 - instead of making everything public
04:43 - and i talk about why you should do it
04:44 - like that so in a course i can talk
04:47 - about all of those tiny things as they
04:48 - come up
04:49 - another benefit of the course is they
04:51 - are simply more compact when you take
04:52 - the whole thing into account
04:54 - when making a tutorial every single
04:56 - video is individual
04:57 - meaning that every single video has an
04:59 - intro outro mention of the patreon my
05:02 - games and so on
05:03 - whereas in the course i only introduced
05:05 - myself in the course right in the
05:06 - beginning and then it's non-stop going
05:08 - from topic to topic
05:09 - that makes it easier to follow the flow
05:11 - rather than constantly having to stop
05:12 - look for the next video watch the intro
05:14 - again and so on and naturally since the
05:17 - videos are free they are ad supported so
05:19 - you need to sit through a five second ad
05:21 - whereas in a paid course you just pay
05:23 - once and that's it there are no more
05:24 - interruption
05:26 - so i've been talking a lot about the
05:27 - benefits of courses but like i said
05:29 - tutorials also have a ton of benefits
05:32 - the main one being that they answer a
05:33 - single very specific question
05:35 - for example i covered a tone tip in a
05:37 - video and i also make it in the course
05:40 - if all you wanted was to learn how to
05:42 - make a tooltip it would make no sense to
05:44 - go through a 10 hour course to learn
05:45 - just that
05:46 - instead you would just watch the
05:47 - separate tone tip tutorial and learn
05:49 - from there
05:50 - so tutorials are excellent when you know
05:52 - exactly what you're looking for and
05:54 - you're just trying to learn one very
05:56 - specific thing
05:57 - another benefit of tutorials is also the
05:59 - simple fact that there are just more
06:00 - tutorials than there are courses
06:02 - you can find thousands of tutorials
06:04 - covering every single topic imaginable
06:06 - however there are comparatively fewer
06:08 - courses covering distinct genres
06:10 - so for me as someone who makes both
06:11 - tutorials and courses it takes me
06:13 - hundreds of hours to make a single
06:15 - course
06:15 - and in that time i can instead make
06:17 - something like 20 tutorials covering 20
06:19 - different topics
06:20 - so the total amount of topics that are
06:22 - covered in separate tutorials is much
06:23 - more than total number of courses
06:25 - and naturally one of the big benefits of
06:27 - tutorials is simply that they are free
06:29 - you just need to sit through a 5 second
06:31 - ad every once in a while and you can get
06:33 - all the knowledge in the world without
06:34 - spending one cent
06:36 - like i said courses are more convenient
06:38 - but if you're willing to put in the work
06:39 - you can get just as much knowledge from
06:41 - searching for tutorials
06:42 - it's a simple exchange of time versus
06:44 - money and how much of each do you value
06:47 - now if you've never done a course before
06:49 - then i would definitely encourage you to
06:51 - do one
06:52 - naturally i recommend my own course
06:53 - since i think it's really good but feel
06:55 - free to do any other
06:56 - there are plenty of high quality courses
06:58 - out there a complete course will teach
07:00 - you how to go from
07:01 - absolutely nothing from complete start
07:03 - to finish
07:04 - one of the hardest things in game
07:06 - development especially for beginners is
07:08 - simply finishing a game
07:09 - everyone can make quick prototypes but
07:11 - creating a complete playable final
07:13 - product is much more difficult
07:15 - so that's how beginners usually end up
07:17 - with dozens of unfinished games sitting
07:19 - on their hard drive
07:20 - however good news is that once you do
07:22 - finish a game it will be that much
07:23 - easier to finish the next one
07:25 - after you go through the process once
07:27 - you'll gain the confidence that will
07:28 - help you in the next one
07:29 - so that's why i encourage you to follow
07:31 - at least one complete game course
07:33 - as long as you put in the work you will
07:34 - have a complete game by the end which
07:36 - will then help you in finishing your own
07:38 - original games
07:39 - and also regarding the question of paid
07:41 - courses versus free tutorials they're
07:43 - just basic human psychology
07:45 - pretty much no one likes to feel like
07:46 - they've made a bad decision and wasted
07:48 - money
07:48 - so that means that you are much more
07:50 - likely to actually follow through a
07:52 - course you've paid for
07:53 - rather than through a free tutorial so
07:55 - especially if you have some issues with
07:56 - self-discipline then that psychological
07:58 - effect alone can be a huge help
08:00 - in getting you to actually follow
08:02 - through and alert knowing you have
08:03 - already invested some time and money
08:05 - will definitely help you keep moving
08:07 - forward
08:08 - so at the end the way i really see this
08:10 - question about which one is better
08:11 - between courses versus tutorials my
08:13 - answer is really both
08:15 - your goal should be to learn and so you
08:16 - should take advantage of every tool at
08:18 - your disposal
08:19 - you should use courses to follow a
08:21 - guided path and learn how a complete
08:23 - game is structured with all of its
08:24 - interconnected systems
08:26 - and you should use tutorials for
08:28 - learning individual things that you
08:29 - require in order to make your game a
08:31 - reality
08:32 - for me as someone who makes courses and
08:33 - tutorials i intend to continue doing
08:35 - both
08:36 - tutorials allow me to cover individual
08:38 - elements and systems in separate videos
08:41 - and courses allow me to do more complete
08:43 - projects covering all aspects of game
08:45 - creation in a single guided path
08:47 - so if you want to learn how to make a
08:48 - complete game from start to finish then
08:50 - go grab my builder defender course
08:52 - and then make sure you're subscribed and
08:54 - hit the bell icon here on youtube in
08:55 - order to watch the various tutorials on
08:57 - tons of different topics coming out
08:59 - every week
09:00 - with that you have the best of both
09:02 - worlds you make a complete game and
09:04 - learn about the individual systems and
09:05 - elements to make your own original games
09:08 - so those are my thoughts on the question
09:10 - of courses versus tutorials
09:11 - let me know in the comments what are
09:12 - your thoughts on this question
09:14 - have you ever followed a complete course
09:17 - have you ever had trouble connecting two
09:18 - separate tutorials
09:19 - and how do you personally view this
09:21 - question do you value one more than the
09:23 - other or do you use everything at your
09:24 - disposal in order to alert
09:26 - let me know in the comments don't forget

09:34 - alright so that's it thanks for
09:36 - listening and i'll see you next time
