00:26 - if you don't yet have a mega pack like
00:27 - this one then I highly recommend you
00:29 - pick this up any time you have an idea
00:30 - for a game it is really useful to have a
00:32 - bunch of assets you can easily pick up
00:34 - and use with all these assets you can
00:35 - make tons of really interesting games
00:37 - and if you want to stay up to date with
00:39 - the latest news on Game Dev Tech and
00:41 - gaming then sign up for my gamedev
00:42 - report newsletter if you've seen my
00:44 - videos on that format then the
00:45 - newsletter is really the same idea just
00:47 - text based which lets me do it much more
00:49 - regularly than these big videos so check
00:51 - out both links in the description all
00:53 - right so starting off with a really nice
00:55 - complex asset for making projectiles and
00:57 - it's titled projectile factoring this
00:59 - one is is a behavior-based projectile
01:01 - system so you can easily Define the
01:03 - projectile data you can use whatever
01:05 - visual you want for it set it up exactly
01:07 - as you want to spawn what you want it to
01:09 - happen as it spawns then add all kinds
01:11 - of weird behaviors like for example
01:13 - should the projectile be rast based
01:15 - should it maybe have some kind of
01:17 - explosion Force should it just move
01:18 - forward or should it destroy itself on
01:20 - collision this asset is made by Infinity
01:22 - PBR so as usual it has tons of custom
01:25 - editor windows with lots and lots of
01:26 - details it also comes with detailed
01:28 - documentation and video Tut tutorials on
01:30 - top of that it also has Integrations
01:32 - with various particle visual effect
01:33 - effects so if you already own any of
01:35 - those you can very quickly set this up
01:37 - and something really unique is how this
01:38 - is actually the first asset that I've
01:40 - seen that has its own theme song
01:41 - definitely check out the asset page just
01:43 - listen to the theme song it's actually
01:44 - pretty fun and then to make your game
01:46 - stand out you need it to be visually
01:48 - unique and one way to achieve that is
01:50 - with some image effects like these this
01:51 - one is actually quite interesting it is
01:53 - not really just a post-processing effect
01:55 - but rather it's a framework to give you
01:57 - control over how exactly you want your
01:59 - game to be render you can select various
02:01 - layers and apply strange effects to them
02:03 - so with a bunch of combinations you can
02:05 - get something very strange very
02:07 - interesting looking like I said being
02:08 - visually unique is extremely important
02:10 - nowadays and by playing around this tool
02:12 - you can definitely get some strange
02:13 - unique visuals that might help your game
02:15 - stand out next if you need a tool to
02:17 - help you make some maps here's a nice
02:18 - one this one is for making 2D Maps like
02:21 - for example your world map to move
02:22 - between levels or you can use it for the
02:24 - level Maps themselves it comes with over
02:26 - a th000 icons to make your own Maps they
02:28 - come in seven different Styles you've
02:30 - got summer spring and winter or you can
02:32 - also make them stylized in black and
02:34 - white or sepan you can change these
02:36 - through a simple drop down menu so just
02:38 - one button click and looks slly
02:40 - different and of course you can also
02:41 - change all these Sprites themselves so
02:43 - you can easily swap between a city
02:44 - Sprite sheet or medial or Arabic this
02:47 - can be a really great way to get tons of
02:49 - very different very unique Maps done
02:50 - very quickly next here's a really nice
02:52 - one for smoothing meshes basically the
02:54 - question is are you tired of the low
02:56 - poly sty with very harsh polygons if so
02:58 - then this actually helps you smooth
03:00 - those out so you can still use low poly
03:02 - acids of which there are tons and tons
03:03 - of them but you can make them look quite
03:05 - a bit more smooth now importantly this
03:06 - does not include new polygons it still
03:08 - has exactly as many polygons as before
03:11 - this one really just modifies the
03:12 - shading in order to make it look smooth
03:14 - you can select each individual Edge you
03:16 - want to smooth and easily make it much
03:17 - less sharp personally I love the low
03:19 - poly style I love it visually and I also
03:21 - love it because there's so much Variety
03:23 - in it but if you're not a fan of that
03:25 - harsh look then with this tool you can
03:26 - still use a ton of those assd packs but
03:28 - make them look much more smooth or
03:30 - perhaps you just need to generate a
03:31 - mountain of rocks if so look at this one
03:34 - this one is a tool for generating rocks
03:36 - and the results are actually quite
03:37 - impressive there are tons and tons of
03:39 - parameters all of them modify the output
03:41 - while always remaining really nice and
03:43 - consistent the results look visually
03:45 - satisfying whil also looking a little
03:46 - bit random you can modify the rock shape
03:48 - but also the material individuals so you
03:50 - can for example add some Moss or some
03:52 - snow on top or you can make it with some
03:54 - really strange colors to make it look
03:56 - like rocks from an alien planet kind of
03:57 - like namk and if all you want is just
04:00 - tons of pre-generated rocks then you can
04:02 - just use the ones in demo scene to use
04:03 - to populate your entire world and then
04:05 - here's a nice Performance Tool called
04:07 - animator LOD like name implies this adds
04:10 - a level of detail onto your animators
04:12 - meaning the further they are from the
04:13 - camera the less bones animate and the
04:15 - less often they animate making it quite
04:17 - a bit more performant this can give you
04:18 - a really nice boost if your game has
04:20 - tons and tons of skin characters on
04:22 - screen at the same time it is super easy
04:24 - to use you can just add a manager script
04:26 - and an individual script next to your
04:28 - animator and that's really it by doing
04:30 - that animators that are close to the
04:31 - camera will animate as usual but those
04:33 - that are far away will animate much less
04:35 - often you can configure a bunch of
04:36 - parameters to customize how exactly you
04:38 - want the LED logic to work but just by
04:40 - default it already works great next for
04:42 - another animated tool here is fake stop
04:44 - motion so if you're going for a stop
04:46 - motion or maybe some animated cartoon
04:48 - style if so then this tool can help
04:50 - achieve that look it simply takes your
04:52 - animations and makes them run much less
04:54 - often so you can cap it to just
04:56 - something like 6 FPS which makes it very
04:58 - stuttery so very much like stop motion
05:00 - or you can put it at some like 12 fps to
05:02 - make it a little bit more cartoony so if
05:04 - you were to combine this with either
05:06 - some kind of cell Shader or a pixel lady
05:08 - Shader if so then you can get a really
05:10 - interesting look for your game then
05:11 - here's one that I think I covered before
05:14 - I believe this one is an upgrade to
05:16 - version 2.0 it is called better
05:17 - transform and it's exactly what the name
05:19 - implies it's a tool that improves upon
05:21 - the regular transform component so you
05:23 - can modify the units so you can very
05:25 - easily scale things in either feet or
05:27 - meters you can inspect the size and
05:29 - units so a certain object like for
05:30 - example a character being able to easily
05:32 - see how tall is your character then you
05:34 - can also add notes to your game objects
05:36 - so you can do that instead of using the
05:38 - name itself as a note you can toggle
05:40 - between local and Global space in the
05:42 - transform itself you can also copy and
05:43 - paste in various ways all in all it does
05:45 - look like one of those assets that Unity
05:47 - probably should really have by default
05:49 - next if you're making something that
05:50 - interacts with the windows API then look
05:52 - at this tool I have done some work with
05:54 - the windows API like for example in the
05:56 - tutorial where I made a transparent
05:57 - Unity window interacting with that API
05:59 - is always really tricky there's lots of
06:01 - really obscure functions so a tool like
06:03 - this to simplify that it does sound
06:05 - really useful especially if you're
06:06 - making for example non-game things in
06:08 - unity you can use this to easily
06:10 - maximize or minimize your window you can
06:12 - modify the frame bord set the
06:14 - transparency the default menu buttons
06:16 - you can update the text in the title bar
06:18 - work with the clipboard get some system
06:20 - information and tons more so if you're
06:21 - making non-game things in normal Windows
06:24 - if so then this can help make that
06:26 - process much much easier then if you
06:27 - want a little bit more control over your
06:29 - look at this one it's a simple tool to
06:31 - help you manage your scenes much more
06:33 - easily so if you're the kind of person
06:34 - who likes using lots of additive scenes
06:36 - then this can really help you can add
06:38 - all of those additive scenes to a list
06:40 - and then when loading that object that
06:42 - scene it will automatically load every
06:44 - single one of those scenes or it also
06:45 - has just one simple benefit that I love
06:47 - since this tool is based on script B
06:49 - objects and direct references because
06:50 - that there are no string references so
06:52 - that alone is a really great bonus that
06:54 - is definitely something you should
06:55 - Implement in your games either with this
06:57 - tool or by yourself all right so those
06:59 - are my top 10 new tools and systems on
07:00 - the UN assur from May 24 there's links
07:03 - on the description and as Bon as you can
