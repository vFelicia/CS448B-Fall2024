00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - in this video we're continuing to create
00:03 - modular spreadsheets as used for guests
00:05 - in Ballarat again we're going to use
00:07 - masks to define primary and secondary
00:09 - colors for our bodies
00:11 - let's begin
00:14 - so here is the spreadsheet we have been
00:16 - creating in this series we have the base
00:19 - part which for now really just contains
00:21 - the foot then we have a body that we are
00:24 - simply picking from four different
00:25 - choices then we have the head which we
00:28 - have been composing from a base head
00:31 - then on top of it we had a randomized
00:33 - hair randomized beard and we also tend
00:35 - random colors on both the hair the beard
00:37 - and also the skin color so with
00:40 - everything that we've learned so far we
00:42 - have all the tools to also be able to
00:43 - customize our bodies and we want to
00:46 - apply both primary and secondary colors
00:48 - so essentially we're going to do
00:50 - something very similar to what we did
00:52 - with the skin color where we have the
00:54 - skin color but we also have a mass to
00:56 - make sure we don't tent inside the eyes
00:57 - so that's the same process we're going
00:59 - to apply to the body in order to
01:01 - separate two parts and apply a different
01:03 - color to either of them the game is out
01:06 - now on seam so check it out to see what
01:07 - I'm teaching here apply to a real game
01:09 - so over here is the spreadsheets that
01:11 - contains all the bodies we have been
01:13 - picking randomly and over here is
01:15 - another one which has some parts
01:17 - centered in white essentially we're
01:18 - going to apply a tint to where we have
01:20 - the white parts and on the ones that are
01:22 - already colored we are going to leave
01:24 - those as is so now let's create the mask
01:26 - so here I have the white sprite opened
01:29 - in Photoshop and now since we're dealing
01:31 - with pixels we can actually fit both the
01:33 - primary and the secondary areas right on
01:36 - the same texture so in here just for
01:38 - testing I'm going to place just a circle
01:40 - I'm going to place a pure green circle
01:43 - so we are in here pick pure green so 0
01:45 - 255 and 0 place it in here so our green
01:49 - color won't be the primary mask and then
01:52 - print a blue circle again use a pure
01:56 - color to make it easier for testing and
01:58 - this will be our secondary cone so by
02:01 - removing base layer this is the mass
02:03 - that we're going to use in order to test
02:05 - so essentially we want to turn this area
02:07 - in one color and this area in another
02:09 - color and those tents will be applied on
02:11 - the base white spreadsheet so here is
02:13 - our mask in unity and now let's head to
02:15 - the code so here the first thing we need
02:17 - is to grab reference to our textures so
02:20 - let's set some 0s fields we're going to
02:22 - have the body texture in white and the
02:25 - body texture mask
02:27 - so let's go down here and see how we
02:28 - were doing the face tent here we define
02:31 - a array that contains all of the various
02:34 - skin colors we pick a random one from
02:36 - the array then we get the pixels from
02:38 - the base head texture then we grab the
02:40 - pixels from the base head mask texture
02:43 - and we tint the pixels inside the mask
02:46 - with our skin color so let's copy this
02:49 - and do the same thing down here on the
02:51 - body pixels and for now let's test only
02:58 - with the second body so in here we are
03:00 - grabbing the white pixels we are
03:02 - grabbing the mask and then let's define
03:05 - a color for the primary color in this
03:09 - case let's just use a pure red so now in
03:11 - here let's tint the body pixels using
03:14 - the body mask as our mask and tint with
03:17 - the primary cone okay so let's test and
03:20 - see how our body looks okay there's our
03:23 - body and as you can see it was tinted in
03:25 - red exactly where the mask is present so
03:27 - so far so good we are doing exactly the
03:29 - same thing as we did for the head we are
03:31 - tinting only inside a mask now obviously
03:34 - we want primary and secondary colors so
03:36 - we need to figure out how to mask but
03:38 - only when the mask matches our mask
03:40 - color over here in the masked texture we
03:43 - define the premiere mask on a green
03:45 - color and the secondary mask using a
03:48 - blue cone so back in our code let's make
03:50 - a function similar to this one general
03:54 - differences we're going to add another
03:55 - parameter that will be a color for our
03:57 - mask color and the only thing we're
04:00 - going to change is in here we're going
04:02 - to apply the tint if the mask alpha is
04:04 - bigger than zero so there's something on
04:05 - the mask and the mask color equals the
04:10 - same as our mask cone
04:12 - so over here we can now use this
04:14 - function now for the primary color we
04:17 - defined a new color we were using a pure
04:21 - green so for the red we give it a zero
04:23 - for the green we give it a one for the
04:24 - blue we give it a zero all right so we
04:27 - should be able to tint the body pixels
04:29 - but only when they match the green cone
04:31 - okay so let's see if only one of our
04:34 - circles appears tinted and give their
04:36 - nests our tint is only being applied on
04:38 - the mask that
04:39 - matches our green cone okay so now we
04:41 - can go back in the code and easily apply
04:44 - the other mask in here let's first
04:46 - define our primary colored mask so here
04:51 - we apply the primary and now let's apply
04:53 - the secondary for the secondary corner
04:55 - let's use a yellow and for the secondary
04:59 - masks color we use a pure blue so let's
05:01 - use this and apply this so again we are
05:06 - using the same body pixels with the same
05:07 - body mask but we're going to tint it
05:10 - using the secondary color but only when
05:12 - the mask matches the secondary mask oh
05:14 - all right now let's test and see if the
05:16 - final body has two tinted colors and yet
05:19 - there it is this circle is being tinted
05:21 - in red and this circle is being tinted
05:22 - in yellow so just like that we have
05:24 - everything we need now all we need to do
05:27 - is actually correctly apply the mask to
05:29 - our base textures okay so here is the
05:32 - final mass being correctly placed as you
05:35 - can see we have various areas for the
05:36 - primary color and various areas for the
05:38 - secondary color so let's see the result
05:40 - with this and yep there it is the final
05:43 - body being composed with a primary and
05:45 - secondary color as defined in our masks
05:47 - so with just some buttons to test and
05:50 - make sure we can use any color
06:10 - okay so here we are with some testing
06:13 - buttons you set the primary and
06:14 - secondary colors so in here and let's
06:16 - set the primary color to yellow
06:17 - secondary color to green and as you can
06:19 - see everything is updating correctly so
06:21 - we can set any color that we want and it
06:24 - all works perfectly fine and now with
06:26 - all the bodies enabled since we used a
06:28 - texture to define our mask you can see
06:30 - that everything is automatically applied
06:32 - to all of them so I can change all of
06:34 - them and they all get tinted correctly
06:36 - the game is out no one seems so check it
06:39 - out to see what I'm teaching here apply
06:41 - to a real game so there you have it we
06:43 - add even more customization to our
06:45 - spreadsheet by defining primary and
06:47 - secondary colors to our body sprite in
06:49 - the next video we're going to figure out
06:50 - how to save and load so we always get
06:53 - the same spreadsheet as always you can
06:54 - download the project from the new Tabriz
06:56 - from unity code monkey comm if you have
06:58 - any questions post them in the comments
06:59 - and I'll do my best answer them
07:00 - subscribe for more videos and I'll see
07:02 - you next time
