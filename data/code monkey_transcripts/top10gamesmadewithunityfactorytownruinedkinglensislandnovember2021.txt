00:03 - games made with unity for november 2021
00:06 - i thought this month wouldn't have many
00:08 - good releases because of black friday
00:09 - and the autumn sale but i was definitely
00:11 - wrong there's tons of really awesome
00:13 - games for you to play which is great but
00:14 - also tons of competition for you as a
00:16 - developer so you really need to bring
00:18 - your a game if you want to be a
00:19 - successful indie game developer you need
00:21 - to keep up to date with what's coming
00:22 - out i make these videos once a month so
00:24 - i can learn which games are finding
00:26 - success all of these games are uniquely
00:28 - impressive so the list is in no
00:29 - particular order except for the number
00:31 - one game that is my personal pick of the
00:33 - month also there is a fill up links in
00:35 - the description for some of the games
00:36 - are you looking for unity jobs check out
00:39 - this video's patreon sponsor

00:49 - inspiration to land your first job in
00:51 - the industry or to find your next great
00:53 - unity role alright so starting off at
00:55 - number 10 with a pretty big release made
00:57 - with unity here is ruined king a league
00:59 - of legends story like the name implies
01:01 - this one is based on the league of
01:03 - legends universe it's a turn-based
01:05 - combat rpg that seems to be very heavy
01:07 - on the story you unite a party of league
01:10 - of legends champions and set sail to
01:12 - uncover this mystery the reviews are
01:14 - very positive so if you don't like
01:16 - league and you like turn based rpgs then
01:18 - this seems like an excellent one for me
01:20 - i stopped playing league about five
01:21 - years ago so i really don't recognize
01:23 - any of these characters in the trailer
01:25 - but if i did then i imagine that this
01:26 - game would be great fun to play and up
01:28 - next for something that just came out of
01:30 - early access and definitely appeals to
01:32 - me here is factory town you build
01:34 - automate and optimize a giant town using
01:37 - conveyor belts trains shoots and pipes
01:40 - it's all in full 3d so it features some
01:42 - really awesome vertical destruction to
01:44 - really make your designs come to life
01:46 - you gather raw materials turn them into
01:48 - something more valuable sell them to
01:49 - nearby villages and then use that profit
01:52 - to expand gather more materials and keep
01:54 - growing features a completely open
01:56 - sandbox mode and also some guided
01:58 - campaign maps with some unique goals it
02:00 - even has workshop support so you can
02:01 - download tons of items that the
02:03 - community already made personally i love
02:05 - automation games but most of them are
02:07 - constantly in early access so seeing
02:09 - this one come out in the full release
02:10 - really makes me want to play it just
02:12 - need to find the time if you're looking
02:14 - for something really chill and zen here
02:16 - is unpacking the concept is really very
02:18 - simple you just moved into a new place
02:20 - and all of your things are on boxes
02:23 - so it's up to you to take the objects
02:24 - from the boxes and place them in the
02:26 - right place it's part puzzle game and
02:28 - part home decoration it describes itself
02:31 - as a meditative game there's no timers
02:33 - no scores no fail state you explore the
02:36 - environment arrange bookshelves and
02:38 - listen to the soundtrack made by a bafta
02:40 - award-winning composer there is also
02:42 - somewhat of a story in the game
02:43 - delivered in an interesting way through
02:45 - the objects you unpack essentially
02:46 - you'll learn more about this character
02:48 - that you never really meet so it's
02:50 - definitely a very unique game it's short
02:52 - and sweet so if that's what you're
02:53 - looking for then give it a shot up next
02:55 - here's an interesting one that i've been
02:57 - watching for quite a long time lens
02:59 - island
03:00 - i've been watching this one for over a
03:01 - year because they have an excellent
03:03 - youtube channel you can watch the
03:05 - development of this game all the way
03:06 - since the beginning three years ago when
03:08 - all it was was just a capsule and some
03:10 - basic use if you're interested in seeing
03:12 - a game take shape definitely go watch
03:14 - all those videos the game itself is an
03:17 - exploration farming crafting building
03:19 - survival game
03:20 - the building system is excellent and
03:22 - actually one of the inspirations for the
03:24 - building system that i made myself in a
03:26 - previous video
03:27 - it's really in depth you can really
03:29 - build the home of your dreams
03:30 - then you can obviously gather resources
03:32 - cut down trees go for fishing and even
03:35 - farm for food and of course if you're
03:37 - feeling adventurous grab sword and go
03:39 - down into the caves it's out now in
03:40 - early access and already has quite a
03:42 - nice amount of very positive reviews by
03:44 - the way if you find the video helpful
03:46 - please hit the like button it's a tiny
03:48 - thing but it really does help thanks
03:50 - then for some really cool vr here is
03:52 - crisis regate 2 it's a great name this
03:55 - one is a fast paced virtual reality
03:57 - shooter you play as a swat trooper
04:00 - either solo or with friends choose your
04:02 - own loadout and take out the bad guys
04:04 - visually it's very impressive a very
04:06 - good looking vr game very realistic
04:08 - visuals which is pretty unique a lot of
04:10 - vr games are very sci-fi so it's nice to
04:12 - see something purely realistic with some
04:14 - excellent visuals it's fast paced but
04:16 - also one of the features they mentioned
04:18 - on the store page is zero sickness so
04:20 - i'd love to test that out next up
04:22 - something pretty unique one cage
04:24 - it's a puzzle adventure game where each
04:27 - side of the cube works as a window to a
04:29 - unique world
04:30 - you sound like the objects in one scene
04:32 - then rotate the cube to interact with
04:34 - both worlds at once visually the effect
04:36 - is excellent makes me want to try making
04:38 - this system you could do it with a bunch
04:39 - of cameras and some render textures and
04:41 - some clever coordinated movement you
04:44 - collect all of the photos from all the
04:45 - worlds in order to uncover the story it
04:47 - also has one of the features that i love
04:49 - in puzzle games there's a hint system to
04:51 - help you when you get stuck
04:53 - personally i really suck at puzzle games
04:55 - so i always love this mechanic
04:57 - it has almost 2 000 overwhelmingly
04:59 - positive reviews so everyone seems to
05:01 - love it then here's another one that
05:03 - came out after a successful time in
05:05 - early access gunfire reborn it's a level
05:08 - based adventure game combining fps
05:10 - roguelike and rpg every level is random
05:13 - each run is unique you meet different
05:15 - heroes experience new weapons items and
05:18 - combat rhythms lots of varied
05:20 - environments with tons of unique
05:21 - characters also you can play either
05:23 - alone or in co-op with four friends i
05:25 - must say that just by looking on the
05:27 - trailer i think it looks a bit generic
05:29 - but it does have over 50 000 very
05:32 - positive reviews so this must play great
05:34 - if you're a fan of side scrollers here's
05:36 - the legend of the ending
05:38 - it's very flashy great comic book style
05:41 - action it's a story about a legendary
05:43 - taiwanese phone hero so in terms of
05:45 - setting that's very unique
05:47 - you've got lots of ninja moves dash roll
05:50 - punch and kick your enemies features a
05:52 - pretty complex kung fu fighting system
05:54 - you can do all kinds of attacks grapple
05:57 - enemies with your sash
05:58 - or throw them in the air and hit them
06:00 - with an air combo there's even a card
06:02 - based minigame to take the break from
06:04 - all the action
06:05 - it certainly looks very unique so if you
06:07 - are looking for a different side
06:08 - scroller then check it out and up next
06:10 - here is the last stand aftermath
06:12 - pretty awesome looking top down shooter
06:14 - i believe this one is actually based on
06:16 - a flash game from a long time ago it's
06:18 - published by armor games for me since i
06:20 - started in flash games i'll always have
06:22 - a soft spot for seeing that name back
06:24 - then it was my dream to get sponsored by
06:26 - armor games this one has a really
06:28 - interesting concept it's a zombie
06:30 - apocalypse and you've already been bit
06:32 - so your time is running out which makes
06:34 - it perfect for a roguelike
06:36 - features the usual survival mechanics
06:38 - you can scavenge for food and resources
06:40 - craft weapons and explore this world but
06:43 - since you're already bit you have a time
06:45 - limit and when you finally die you pick
06:47 - up the game again as a new survivor with
06:49 - new perks and upgrades based on your
06:50 - last run
06:52 - visually the game looks really excellent
06:54 - great shooting great ragdolls the grass
06:56 - looks great and the lighting effects at
06:58 - night make them look really gorgeous
07:00 - i haven't played a survival game in
07:01 - quite a while so i'd love to give this
07:03 - one a try and finally at number one for
07:05 - my personal pick of the month if you're
07:07 - looking for something really wholesome
07:08 - here is to the rescue it's a very
07:11 - charming dog shelter simulator
07:13 - personally i love dogs so this one
07:14 - really hits me just the right way i've
07:16 - actually had the idea of making a game
07:18 - just like this but never got around to
07:20 - it so i'm really happy that someone else
07:22 - did
07:22 - it's a management game so you take dogs
07:24 - in you keep them fed and well taken care
07:26 - of and hopefully find a home for them
07:28 - you can run a fundraiser and expand your
07:30 - shelter so you can help even more dogs
07:33 - each dog is unique with their own needs
07:35 - and desires and it even has a petting
07:37 - mini game and on top of all that twenty
07:39 - percent of the death profits from this
07:41 - game go towards a pet charity so just by
07:44 - buying the game you can have some fun
