00:00 - here's a quick unity tip let's say you
00:02 - have a certain script with a list or
00:04 - array that you want to fill
00:05 - so i want to fill in this item list with
00:07 - all of my items now one approach is to
00:10 - drag them all one by one so just click
00:11 - and drag and so on
00:13 - that's not very efficient especially if
00:15 - you have a ton of items
00:16 - so instead you can use shift click to
00:18 - select a bunch of items
00:19 - but now the inspector has changed so you
00:21 - can no longer drag it
00:23 - so here's a tip select your object with
00:25 - the script
00:26 - then there's this nice lock button click
00:28 - on it and now even if you select another
00:30 - object it will keep this one in the
00:32 - inspector
00:33 - now you can select all the items and
00:35 - drag them all at once click once again
00:36 - to unlock
00:37 - okay subscribe for more tips
