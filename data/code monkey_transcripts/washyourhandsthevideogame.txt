00:00 - in this video we're going to look at a
00:01 - nice simple game I made called wash your
00:03 - hands it's a concept that's pretty
00:05 - relevant nowadays so here I won't play
00:07 - through the game and go through an
00:09 - overview of how the game works you can
00:11 - also play it for yourself on the website
00:12 - let's begin
00:16 - [Music]
00:20 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:23 - and this channel is all about helping
00:24 - you will learn how to make your own
00:25 - games with in-depth tutorials made by a
00:27 - professional indie game developer so if
00:29 - you find the video helpful consider
00:30 - subscribing okay so this last week I was
00:33 - dealing with these recent events I came
00:35 - up with an idea and start working on
00:37 - this game now one thing that I love
00:39 - about game development is creating
00:40 - systems with specific roles if you've
00:42 - played my games and you've certainly
00:43 - noticed that they are all very
00:45 - mechanically focused so what I built
00:47 - here is a simple game where we have a
00:49 - nice level and our goal is to contain
00:52 - and eliminate the spread now needless to
00:54 - say this game is obviously not medically
00:57 - accurate or medical advice it's a very
00:59 - very oversimplified simulation of how
01:01 - germs can spread so first of all if
01:04 - you'd like to play to yourself before
01:05 - watching the rest of this video then
01:07 - check the link in the description it
01:09 - goes to a page where you can play the
01:10 - game and below it you'll actually see
01:13 - links to the various systems and
01:14 - elements that are used to make this game
01:16 - that I covered in separate videos so go
01:18 - ahead play for yourself and come back
01:20 - here all right so now that you're back
01:22 - let's look at the game let's play
01:24 - through it and I'll do an overview of
01:25 - how it works so here we are at the start
01:28 - of the game I have my player character
01:29 - and I can just move around now as I
01:32 - always mention in my videos it's very
01:34 - important to write clean code now the
01:35 - reason why I was able to make this
01:37 - pretty complex minigame in such a short
01:39 - amount of time is because I reuse tons
01:42 - of systems that I made previously again
01:45 - check the game page linked in the
01:46 - description which contains links to all
01:48 - of the various systems for example the
01:50 - player movement was made in a previous
01:52 - video the difference is since here I'm
01:54 - working in 3d the character moves in the
01:56 - X and Z instead of the X and one so just
01:59 - one tiny change and I'm using the rest
02:01 - of that class and since I'm using that
02:04 - one sounds so happy Dodger all that we
02:06 - implement so this move probably doesn't
02:09 - make any sense in this minigame but so I
02:11 - left it because it's just fun this video
02:13 - is made possible thanks to these awesome
02:15 - supporters go to patreon.com/scishow to
02:17 - code monkey to get some perks and help
02:19 - keep the videos free for everyone so
02:21 - again here I am in this nice level I can
02:24 - move around the map and you can see
02:26 - there are essentially three areas so
02:28 - there's this down here this one here and
02:29 - this one on the right and then over here
02:31 - we have a bathroom
02:32 - three sinks so the workers are just
02:35 - doing their thing
02:35 - so they go to a desk like this one here
02:38 - then they go to a bookshelf they were
02:39 - around and they roam around randomly so
02:41 - essentially they are moving around all
02:43 - over the place now the goal of the game
02:45 - is to contain the spread so right now as
02:47 - you can see everyone is healthy there
02:49 - are no germs anywhere and all the
02:51 - workers are perfectly healthy and then
02:54 - down here I can access my nice menu and
02:56 - I can make someone sick by pressing a
02:58 - button so click on this and a random one
03:00 - yep there you go that one has just
03:02 - become infected now wherever he is going
03:04 - here you can see that he's spreading
03:06 - some germs and now whenever someone goes
03:08 - through the area where that one has been
03:10 - they also started to get sick and after
03:13 - they spend a long time surrounded by
03:14 - germs and they themselves also become
03:16 - sick they become caries and they start
03:18 - spreading the germs there you go now
03:19 - this one is starting to spread so the
03:21 - infection started with just one worker
03:23 - now there are two and there's a bunch of
03:24 - in fact there is and now there are
03:26 - almost three and so on and so on
03:27 - now as the player we have two actions
03:29 - using the left mouse button we can use a
03:32 - spray so this one kills the germs so as
03:34 - I spread around I can clean up some
03:37 - areas so doing so eliminates the germs
03:40 - on certain positions on the map however
03:42 - he is still sick so he still spreading
03:44 - the germs so the other action that I
03:46 - have is approaching him and pressing the
03:47 - right mouse button and there you go I
03:49 - tell him to wash his hands place a nice
03:51 - cinematic and there he goes onto the
03:53 - toilet onto the sink and starts washing
03:54 - his hands then once he's done washing
03:57 - the hands he can look at the sprite yep
03:58 - you can see that now he's clean and no
04:00 - longer infected so this is the core game
04:02 - loop at work all the systems work nicely
04:04 - together so you can see how just by
04:06 - starting with a single sick worker we
04:08 - can end up with everyone sick so all
04:11 - this started with just one and there you
04:12 - go lots of germs everywhere again this
04:15 - game is obviously not medically accurate
04:17 - washing your hands won't actually cure
04:19 - any sickness but so this is an
04:21 - interesting way of seeing how washing
04:22 - your hands can help reduce the spread
04:23 - now all of these systems working
04:25 - together might seem complex but that
04:27 - complexity comes from combining some
04:29 - very simple rules so I'm looking at how
04:31 - the game was made the first thing you've
04:33 - noticed is the visuals normally I work
04:36 - strictly in 2d but here I went with an
04:38 - interesting different approach what I
04:39 - have here is a 3d world so all of the
04:42 - meshes on the level everything is 3d but
04:44 - the characters are my normal 2d
04:46 - characters so if I pause the game so
04:48 - here I am in the scene view and I can
04:50 - rotate the camera and there we go you
04:51 - can see the effect in action so you can
04:53 - see the characters are on Kabuli flat
04:55 - and then the one is made up of nice
04:57 - normal 3d objects so in this case for
05:00 - melanin level I use to unity snaps packs
05:02 - I cover the entity snaps in a previous
05:04 - video and the packs that I'm using here
05:06 - are the office pack with these tables
05:09 - and computers and things and then also
05:11 - the skull pack with some chairs papers
05:13 - blackboards and sinks there's links in
05:16 - the description if you want to get these
05:17 - packs to play it for yourself
05:18 - so we have our 2d characters working
05:21 - around in a 3d world now the other
05:23 - important element is the camera in order
05:26 - to have this effect work the most
05:27 - important thing is keeping the camera
05:29 - field of view very small now in a normal
05:31 - 3d game you would use something like a
05:33 - 60 fov however here if I try to use a
05:37 - similar fov so let's put it at 60 but if
05:40 - you use that type of fov in here you can
05:42 - see there is a lot of distortion on all
05:44 - the various sprites especially when they
05:46 - are on the corner of the screen so right
05:47 - there that one definitely looks like a
05:49 - 2d sprite so this can still look
05:51 - interesting but I prefer to lower the
05:53 - FOV in order to reduce the distortion by
05:55 - keeping the fov small you can see the
05:57 - sprites don't really stretch as much
05:58 - when they're on the edges alright so
06:00 - that's the camera effect then the last
06:03 - one is the depth of field effect so you
06:05 - can see over here on the top of the
06:07 - screen it's slightly bored this is just
06:09 - a basic post-processing effect that's
06:11 - included in the post-processing sack so
06:13 - here it is just a basic volume with a
06:15 - depth of field effect then there's the
06:17 - camera as you can see it is always
06:19 - following the player without using any
06:21 - rotation whatsoever so the rotation is
06:24 - fixed looking down it never changes now
06:26 - the foam oh I'm using the same machines
06:28 - virtual camera and I also covered scene
06:30 - machine in a previous video this is
06:33 - actually super simple all I did was make
06:35 - this cinema scene virtual camera and you
06:37 - can see it as the follow following the
06:38 - player character controller and we just
06:41 - see simple offset and that's all you
06:42 - have to do and it's a very nice simple
06:44 - camera now another part of the visuals
06:46 - are the workers these sprites are
06:49 - randomly generated so they are own
06:51 - pretty unique this is pretty much the
06:53 - exact same code that I used when making
06:54 - general Tycoon so they have a random
06:57 - body face hair beard hair color and skin
06:59 - :
07:00 - I covered how this system works in the
07:02 - emotional guest spreadsheets video so go
07:04 - check it out also on the workers you can
07:06 - see if they're sick so here only me use
07:08 - the options to infect a random worker no
07:11 - let's look at that in fact work where is
07:13 - yep there you go you can see he has some
07:15 - green things on top of him and on the
07:17 - other ones you can see they have nothing
07:19 - so the spreads no and this is also
07:21 - increasing so as that one becomes more
07:23 - and more sick you can start to see some
07:24 - green parts appear on top of them now
07:27 - this is him through a very simple shader
07:29 - so I have a point the same shader onto
07:32 - here onto my player character and here
07:34 - you can see on the sheeter oh it has is
07:36 - a simple texture that contains all of
07:38 - those green positions and as I increase
07:40 - this value you can see the green part
07:42 - showing up and starting to glow so it
07:44 - goes up lots of green germs and it goes
07:46 - down it goes back to zero so a very nice
07:48 - and pretty simple effect I've covered a
07:51 - bunch of effects before so check
07:52 - out the phone playlist then over here on
07:54 - the UI I'm showing some stats so in here
07:57 - is the number of infected workers then
08:00 - the number of areas with germs and
08:02 - finally this is the number of empty
08:04 - sinks of ailments so there you go send
08:05 - this one to a sink and it goes down from
08:07 - 3 to and clean up some areas and that
08:10 - one goes down all right so that's the
08:12 - visuals for the game now let's check out
08:15 - the various systems the germ spread is
08:17 - composed of two systems there's the map
08:19 - and then the workers the map is built
08:22 - using the grid system that I made quite
08:23 - a while ago so yet another example of
08:26 - the power of writing clean code when we
08:28 - made a class we made it work with
08:29 - generics so we could use it with any
08:31 - object and that's exactly what I'm doing
08:33 - here I can turn on gizmos and yep just
08:36 - like that you can visually see how the
08:38 - grid is located so all these great
08:40 - positions this is how the map is set up
08:42 - and again I did the same thing that I
08:44 - did with the character control so just
08:46 - instead of having an XY grid I just
08:48 - swapped it for an X at grid so one tiny
08:50 - change and now I can use my nice grid
08:52 - system in a 3d world now each one of
08:54 - these word positions holds an object
08:56 - that has a certain level of infection so
08:58 - here is the code where we are in sin
09:00 - shading a new grid as well as a new grid
09:03 - object so here is our grid object class
09:06 - first when you make our grid we just
09:08 - have our lower left and upper right
09:09 - corners then we come with the width and
09:12 - height in integers
09:13 - our grid size then we instantiate our
09:15 - grid using our nice squared object and
09:17 - then here our grid object pretty much
09:19 - just contains a fault for the various
09:20 - amount then a bunch of functions in
09:23 - order to add or remove that amount then
09:25 - there's the vision which is hemant by a
09:27 - particle system here it is it's just
09:30 - some particles in a cube being spawned
09:32 - moving around randomly and disappearing
09:34 - so there's one of these particle systems
09:36 - spawn per each grid position and then
09:38 - through code we set our emission rate
09:40 - over time based on the virus amount on
09:42 - this great object so if that grid
09:45 - position has zero then this one is set
09:47 - to zero and we have nothing and if it is
09:49 - formed then we set it to value and we
09:50 - have lots of particles just walking
09:52 - around so here in the game I can turn on
09:54 - some nice grid visuals there you go we
09:56 - have some nice debug visuals so here we
09:58 - can see the internal values on each grid
10:01 - position so let's locate one that is
10:04 - infected and there you go as he walks
10:06 - around you can see that the value behind
10:08 - them is increasing so wherever they go
10:10 - they are spreading their germs so like
10:13 - this one is infected and as he moves yep
10:15 - there we go he increases the position
10:17 - underneath them and as the amount
10:19 - increases so do the number of particles
10:21 - so over here one weights 78 they're
10:23 - going lots of particles and here with
10:24 - under one and there you go just tiny
10:26 - amount now the player has a special
10:28 - spray to clear the germs and as I click
10:31 - I can use it and there you go you can
10:32 - see the numbers constantly going down so
10:34 - as I hit the areas that I hit they go
10:37 - down and as they go down the particles
10:38 - also go down so the visual disappears so
10:41 - that's mechanics let's look at how the
10:43 - spray works so here is now the first
10:46 - thing is we're working in 3d and not in
10:48 - 2d meaning that in order to get the
10:50 - spray position we need to actually do
10:52 - array from the camera position so that's
10:55 - what we're doing in here we get array
10:56 - using the input Mouse position then we
10:59 - do a ray cast and we do that ray cast
11:01 - make sure that we hit on the form layer
11:03 - and after we collide we can get the
11:05 - mouse position then here you can also
11:07 - see underneath the mouth there is a nice
11:10 - indicator showing where the mouse is on
11:11 - the world position so for here as I go
11:14 - up you can see that the mouse is not
11:15 - interact with the wall but rather it
11:16 - just hits with the floor so we take our
11:19 - mouse position and the point position
11:20 - then you come later it direction towards
11:22 - the mouse and we use that in order to
11:24 - trigger our spray now the spray also has
11:26 - a nice
11:27 - Perkin system so in here were just
11:29 - setting the position the rotation and
11:30 - we're manually emitting some particles
11:32 - once the input mouse button is down then
11:35 - here in our spray function now this
11:37 - looks complex but it's actually pretty
11:39 - simple again the core of this system is
11:41 - based on the grid system so what we're
11:43 - doing here essentially just calculating
11:45 - a bunch of positions we get those
11:47 - positions in a cone so we apply some
11:48 - rotation to our basic spray direction
11:50 - then we take all of these positions and
11:53 - we convert them into grid positions and
11:55 - then we simply reduce the virus on that
11:57 - grid position so that's how the spray
11:59 - works in a nice cone so there you go I
12:01 - can walk around and clean up all these
12:03 - areas and you can see debug with the
12:05 - numbers all going down down down so
12:08 - that's how this works so here is how the
12:10 - map terms are set up we have a grid
12:12 - system behind it then a grid object
12:14 - holding a simple value and then based on
12:17 - that value we have the particle system
12:19 - visuals then these sick workers increase
12:21 - the underlying map value and the player
12:24 - spray reduces that value all right so
12:26 - now for the workers they're low pretty
12:28 - complex but they're actually quite
12:29 - simple the workers here are using the
12:32 - modular character system that I made in
12:33 - a previous video now in that video I
12:36 - made a module that works with my custom
12:38 - pathfinding system however in here I
12:40 - didn't want pathfinding to be limited to
12:42 - just great positions so instead of that
12:44 - custom pathfinding system I'm using the
12:46 - unities navmesh system so I made a new
12:48 - model that works exactly with that so
12:51 - here is a worker and if you saw the
12:54 - modular character system video then this
12:56 - looks familiar so we're here is the new
12:58 - module that I made using the move
13:00 - position pathfinding on the navmesh
13:02 - then we have the basic move masa T
13:04 - except this one just converted to use 3d
13:06 - and then finally the work in logic
13:08 - module that handles all the various
13:10 - logic now the navmesh is very simple so
13:13 - we can go open our navigation tab and
13:15 - here we can see how our nav mesh is
13:18 - baked it's just a basic unity nav mesh
13:20 - so it's baked and all the walking
13:22 - position so it works pretty well now the
13:24 - only thing that I made was make the
13:26 - toilet have a very high move cost so
13:29 - this is so that the workers don't use
13:31 - the toilet as a shortcut rather go down
13:33 - here instead of through here so to set
13:35 - it I just set the areas an area for
13:37 - toilet and put a very high move cost so
13:39 - that's pretty much it just a very
13:41 - navmesh and here is the pathfinding
13:43 - navmesh move position script and it's
13:45 - pretty simple to the path fighting that
13:47 - I used in that video so the only
13:49 - difference is instead of using my custom
13:50 - path finding over here we're using the
13:52 - navmesh
13:53 - so going to the navmesh come later path
13:54 - then it gets a path and in here it
13:57 - simply follows that path so it's pretty
13:59 - similar to our using modular care system
14:01 - just using a different path filing
14:02 - system
14:03 - then we have the working logic so this
14:06 - one is also pretty simple we just have a
14:08 - basic state machine so it's similar to
14:10 - what I covered in the simple enemy AI
14:12 - video all we have is a handful of states
14:14 - so I don't when his waiting somewhere
14:17 - moving when he's moving to an
14:18 - interaction point then going to tell it
14:20 - when he's going there then while he's
14:23 - washing his hands and you see general
14:24 - busy so that's it we have some very
14:26 - simple behavior when he's eyes only he
14:29 - comes on a timer and then sets a random
14:31 - move position when he's moving he's
14:33 - setting the move position using that
14:34 - other component and then when he gets
14:37 - there he decides what to do and now the
14:39 - interesting thing is over here on the
14:41 - random move position so this is set up
14:43 - in a very interesting way over here I'm
14:45 - looking at the map we can see a bunch of
14:47 - interaction points you can see all of
14:48 - them with this nice diamond icon now we
14:51 - have three types of interaction points
14:52 - we have the desks over here in blue so
14:55 - some desks here and that's here that's
14:56 - here then we have in green the
14:58 - miscellaneous so this one's just looking
15:01 - at that bookshelf looking at that plant
15:03 - at these lockers and so on and then
15:06 - finally the yellow ones which are the
15:07 - sinks so they are all inside of this
15:10 - interaction points game object and here
15:12 - we just have this script so it goes
15:14 - through all these children and fills up
15:17 - the list with all the points now the
15:19 - points also have the type in a simple
15:21 - script so just the base genome so that's
15:23 - misc and toilet and all I did was
15:25 - manually place all of these game objects
15:27 - I rotated them to face the correct
15:29 - direction and that's pretty much it so
15:31 - this is a very designer friendly
15:33 - workflow so then the worker simply
15:35 - requests to the interactions point
15:37 - handler he asks for a specific type that
15:40 - is close to his position and then he
15:42 - gets the interaction point where he's
15:44 - going to go to so then he just swaps out
15:46 - the things so if he's currently on a
15:48 - desk then he's going to look for a
15:50 - miscellaneous and if he's on a
15:52 - miscellaneous or a toilet then he's
15:53 - going to look for a desk
15:55 - so they're constantly bouncing back and
15:56 - forth between the two different types so
15:58 - that's pretty much it for their logic
15:59 - for walk me around now the worker also
16:02 - has a nice object down here and again
16:05 - pretty much all this does is just hones
16:06 - a simple value so if the value is max
16:09 - then he sick and starts spreading and
16:11 - the spread is handled by another class
16:13 - so over here the way that it's set up we
16:15 - have a nice stick update so I'm using
16:17 - the function periodic from the code
16:19 - monkey Tony's so this triggers this
16:21 - function every certain amount of time so
16:23 - every point one seconds we're going to
16:25 - run this function and then here we're
16:27 - just going to do two things first of all
16:29 - at the virus on the position so we go
16:31 - through all the workers and we add a
16:33 - certain amount right where the worker is
16:35 - standing if the worker is in fact and
16:37 - then we go through the workers we check
16:40 - if we have a virus where the worker is
16:42 - standing and if so then we add the virus
16:45 - amount onto the worker so here is in the
16:47 - game and we can open up the debug view
16:49 - so both for the map and for the workers
16:51 - so there give that one it has a hundred
16:53 - so he's come all infected and there
16:55 - you're worried he walks he's spreading
16:56 - and then these ones as they walk over
16:59 - areas that are infected you can see yep
17:01 - their number goes up and as they go up
17:04 - they start showing more and more of
17:06 - those green things and as they go up to
17:09 - a hundred then now they are infected so
17:11 - now as this one moves you can see that
17:13 - he's starting to infect that area and as
17:15 - he moves away yep now he's running so
17:17 - just like that that's how the logic
17:19 - works it's a pretty basic interaction
17:21 - but it seems pretty complex since it's
17:22 - working with other systems
17:24 - now finally we have the action to tunnel
17:26 - worker to wash his hands so from the
17:28 - worker it's very simple
17:29 - he just gets an interaction point of
17:31 - type toilet and then he goes there plays
17:33 - animation and clears his German mount
17:34 - and on the player first we check if
17:37 - there's a worker nearby if so then we
17:38 - show this nice visual and when we
17:40 - right-click if there we go we have a
17:42 - very nice cinematic it was animation and
17:45 - there he goes in there so this nice
17:47 - cinematic is made using another
17:49 - syn machine virtual camera so we have
17:51 - the camera we zoom in play the animation
17:53 - and do a bunch of things so it's a
17:55 - pretty nice simple cinematic and there
17:57 - you go he goes in there and he does his
17:59 - thing washed his hands and when he goes
18:01 - out yep there you go now he's clean so
18:03 - pretty much here the goal of the game is
18:04 - to get all the workers cleaned up and
18:06 - clean up on the
18:07 - so time to go and then he goes now that
18:09 - one is going to be clean and meanwhile
18:10 - I'm clearing up these areas so it's a
18:13 - nice immolation showing of how if
18:15 - they're always washing their hands and
18:16 - the virus is easily contained but if you
18:18 - let it run around like it is in here
18:20 - then all of a sudden becomes very very
18:22 - difficult to get it under control so
18:24 - right now with 500 areas infected and 23
18:27 - yep right now it's almost impossible to
18:30 - get back and take everything under
18:31 - control then here if you're playing for
18:33 - something you want to get at this point
18:35 - then over here we have two buttons
18:36 - hardly the default mode but I can turn
18:39 - on and easy and that won't slow down the
18:41 - rate of infection so I can now go
18:44 - through and start clearing up things
18:45 - more easily send them towards their
18:47 - hands and now with easy mode it has
18:49 - become a bit more manual alright so this
18:53 - is the mini game I made given current
18:55 - recent events now obviously this game
18:57 - isn't medical advice or even medically
18:59 - accurate but still one of these simplest
19:01 - things you can do is just wash your
19:03 - hands to prevent yourself from being
19:04 - sick or spreading germs onto others so I
19:06 - really hope you enjoyed this nice little
19:08 - minigame and remember to stay safe
