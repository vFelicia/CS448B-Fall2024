00:08 - video let's check out some of the
00:10 - highlights that were released in
00:11 - september 2021. this one is a list of
00:14 - paid systems and tools in the last video
00:16 - i already covered all the best free new
00:18 - assets so go watch that if you haven't
00:20 - seen it and in the next video i will be
00:22 - covering the top assets and effects let
00:24 - me know which one of these you're most
00:26 - interested in and i might do a detailed
00:27 - review on it as always there's links to
00:29 - the assets in the description and as a
00:31 - bonus you can use the coupon code
00:32 - monkey10 to get 10 off your order
00:35 - by the way there's a mega bundle
00:36 - happening right now on the unity asset
00:38 - store as usual it's a super deep
00:40 - discount up to 95 off it contains lots
00:43 - of interesting tools so there's one to
00:45 - help you manage an inventory database
00:47 - another one for placing some decals and
00:49 - a terrain system there's a digging
00:51 - system you can slice meshes volumetric
00:53 - vfx and tons more as usual with such a
00:55 - deep discount it's worth it if just one
00:57 - of these assets looks interesting check
00:59 - it out with the link in the description
01:01 - alright so starting off with a really
01:03 - interesting interactive effects engine
01:06 - it helps you bring your scenes to life
01:07 - by having your effects interact with
01:09 - other objects for example you can make
01:11 - some fire that spreads to nearby objects
01:14 - make a plan to grow around an object or
01:17 - freeze everything in sight or
01:18 - electrified you can modify everything
01:20 - since all the effects are done with
01:22 - unity's vfx graph it includes six
01:25 - effects for use with both urp and agrp
01:28 - and then three variations only for hdrp
01:31 - with some excellent visuals if your game
01:33 - features elemental magic then this asset
01:35 - would be a great thing to base all of
01:37 - your spells on
01:38 - next up if your game involves some sort
01:41 - of furry creatures check out this first
01:43 - studio
01:44 - this is a fur rendering system it was
01:46 - designed for extreme performance quality
01:48 - and ease of use
01:50 - it is your gpu to the max while also
01:52 - working on mobile the effect looks
01:54 - pretty great all of the fur reacts to
01:56 - the animated character exactly as a tune
01:58 - so as it moves the fur also moves with
02:00 - it you can get just the urp edition or
02:03 - pick up the ultimate edition if you also
02:05 - need to work on the built-in or the high
02:07 - definition render pipeline and next up
02:10 - is an anti-cheat toolkit
02:12 - now my opinion on what to do about
02:14 - cheating in your own games is simply
02:16 - don't bother
02:17 - if you're working on a single player
02:19 - game then don't really waste your time
02:21 - trying to stop players from cheating on
02:22 - their own games you're better off
02:24 - spending that time just making the game
02:26 - better
02:27 - but if you do want to try and stop
02:29 - cheating then you might as well use a
02:30 - proper asset instead of trying to handle
02:32 - security on your own
02:34 - and of course if you are working on a
02:35 - multiplayer game then of course you do
02:37 - need to deal with cheating this one
02:38 - obscures position in memory so things
02:41 - like cheat engine cannot find it it also
02:43 - detects dll injection it protects binary
02:46 - files detects speed hacks wall hacks and
02:48 - so on
02:49 - so like i said in most cases don't worry
02:51 - about it but if you do then use a proper
02:54 - acid like this one and then here is a
02:56 - universal vehicle controller it's got
02:59 - quite a lot of features
03:00 - obviously you can drive it but you also
03:02 - have drifting you've got some lights
03:05 - you've got nitrous and so on
03:07 - and it even includes some pretty nice
03:09 - destruction all the panels come off and
03:11 - the whole car gets totally destroyed on
03:13 - top of that it also includes ai so you
03:16 - can easily create the ii path and play
03:18 - against the computer
03:20 - it's a great starting point for your
03:21 - next racing game
03:23 - if you're working on a game with some
03:24 - crafting maybe look into this crafting
03:26 - system
03:27 - create your items define the icons
03:30 - select the prefab the finance text size
03:32 - and a bunch more properties
03:34 - you create a recipe and drag drop to
03:36 - define how it works you can pick up
03:38 - items and add them to your inventory
03:40 - open the recipe and craft the item seems
03:42 - pretty easy to use it's got tutorial
03:44 - videos as well as detailed documentation
03:47 - up next here's a unique one it's a
03:50 - streaming engine you can stream your
03:52 - unity window to an html page you can
03:55 - stream from your pc onto mobile
03:58 - so it allows you to add live streaming
04:00 - into your game with ease
04:01 - you can use it for video chat remote
04:03 - assist teaching and learning and so on
04:06 - so it's a pretty specific thing but
04:07 - based on reviews it works very well then
04:10 - a tool that might be very useful to you
04:12 - world clusters you can split your world
04:15 - into multiple clusters and easily toggle
04:17 - them either on or off
04:19 - this can be great for performance you
04:21 - can split your massive world into many
04:23 - pieces and only load the nearest ones
04:26 - or it can also be great for vertical
04:28 - games with many forwards you make each
04:30 - floor into a cluster and only load the
04:32 - second floor when the player goes up
04:33 - there by unloading unused objects you
04:36 - can really massively improve the
04:37 - performance of your game i'm always a
04:39 - fan of tools that do just one thing very
04:41 - well and this is exactly it
04:43 - then if you have water in your game
04:45 - here's a great looking water system
04:47 - it looks very realistic you've got some
04:50 - water and waves you've got underwater
04:52 - rendering with some gorgeous looking
04:54 - light rays
04:55 - you can even manually paint the currents
04:57 - in the ocean in order to make the scene
04:58 - feel much more natural
05:00 - and of course play around the visuals to
05:02 - get any visual you want so you can make
05:04 - a gorgeous bright blue lake or a really
05:07 - dark and scary ocean whatever settings
05:09 - you choose it always looks great if
05:11 - you're into ar games and especially
05:14 - something like pokemon go then check out
05:16 - this template
05:17 - it lets you throw objects in ar use two
05:20 - throwing modes and customize all the
05:22 - parameters personally i haven't used ar
05:24 - in unity so no idea how good this is but
05:27 - if you're trying to build your own
05:28 - pokemon go then this could be a good
05:30 - starting point
05:31 - and at last also a very interesting tool
05:33 - a ui and layout customizer this one is
05:36 - especially useful for mobile games where
05:38 - a lot of players like to customize the
05:40 - controls instead of forcing one layout
05:42 - on your players let them place the
05:44 - buttons in joysticks wherever they
05:45 - prefer
05:46 - you can change the size and opacity and
05:48 - really customize any element you want
05:51 - based on the description it's super easy
05:53 - to use just attach your script onto any
05:55 - object you want to move and it just
05:56 - works alright so those are my top 10 new
05:59 - tools and systems on the unity asset
