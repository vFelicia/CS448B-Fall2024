00:00 - here's a quick empty tip so here is my
00:02 - player character and here is an
00:04 - enemy i want him to walk towards me
00:06 - however when i play the scene
00:08 - yep as you can see the movement was
00:10 - really fast and then really slow instead
00:11 - of being constantly a character should
00:13 - walk
00:14 - so let's see the issue here is the code
00:16 - the enemy has a reference to the player
00:18 - and completes the direction vector
00:19 - towards the player
00:21 - and then it moves its own transform in
00:22 - that direction
00:24 - however the issue here is that this
00:26 - direction vector has a magnitude of
00:28 - whatever the distance is between the
00:29 - player and the enemy
00:31 - so since the magnitude is based on the
00:32 - distance it means it will move faster
00:34 - the further away he is
00:35 - then slow down as it gets closer the
00:37 - solution here is very simple
00:39 - all we need to do is normalize the
00:40 - direction vector normalizing the vector
00:43 - makes it so that the magnitude always
00:44 - equals one
00:45 - so by normalizing the vector the
00:47 - distance will become irrelevant and it
00:49 - won't keep the direction
00:50 - now we can test again and yep there it
00:52 - goes the enemy is now moving at a
00:53 - constant speed no matter how far it is
00:56 - okay subscribe for more tips
