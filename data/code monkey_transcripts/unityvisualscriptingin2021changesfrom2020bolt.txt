00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and this is a pretty quick video just
00:03 - highlighting some changes with visual
00:05 - scripting in unity 2021
00:07 - as you might know visual scripting in
00:09 - unity is actually based on bolt which
00:11 - was a third-party tool that unity bought
00:14 - so if you're using unity 2019 or 2020
00:17 - then you use visual scripting through
00:19 - the bone package
00:20 - however if you're using unity 2021 then
00:23 - visual scripting is now built directly
00:25 - into the engine
00:26 - so there's no extra packages you need to
00:27 - install there's only a handful of minor
00:30 - changes so if you're searching for bond
00:32 - tutorials all of those should still work
00:34 - in unity 2021 just with a few minor
00:36 - tweaks
00:37 - speaking of that i made a complete
00:39 - visual scripting course going from start
00:40 - to finish
00:41 - everything i teach in the course is
00:43 - still up to date you just need a few
00:45 - minor changes
00:45 - if you want to follow it with unity 2021
00:48 - the course teaches you everything about
00:50 - visual scripting through the making of
00:51 - three complete games
00:52 - starting off with a simple platformer
00:54 - game then moving on to a more complex
00:57 - action rpg with tons of features like
00:59 - multiple weapons enemies dungeons shops
01:01 - skills and so on
01:02 - and finally the last game is a really
01:04 - awesome fps that teaches you how to use
01:06 - visual scripting in 3d
01:08 - with tons of weapons a really nice hook
01:10 - shot ability and an
01:11 - awesome boss fight check out the
01:13 - complete course with the link in the
01:14 - description
01:15 - so let's see those minor changes the
01:17 - first one is like i mentioned how you
01:19 - install it
01:19 - in unity 2019 or 2020 you go into the
01:22 - asset store and grab the bump package
01:25 - then you open up the packaging package
01:27 - manager and import it
01:28 - and then pops out the bolt setup wizard
01:30 - okay so that's the install process for
01:32 - unt
01:33 - 2019 or 2020. for unity 2020 it's
01:36 - instead installed as a built-in package
01:39 - so you go into the package manager and
01:42 - appear select the unity registry
01:44 - and simply scroll down and find the
01:46 - visual scripting package
01:47 - now in unity 2020 you have a quick setup
01:50 - wizard menu
01:51 - whereas on unt 2021 this does not exist
01:54 - so over here you just go ahead and click
01:55 - on next
01:56 - and then here it asks you a really
01:58 - interesting question so do you want some
02:00 - human naming or programmer naming
02:02 - so this has to do with what text shows
02:04 - up on the nodes
02:05 - and this one is also different in unity
02:07 - 2021 in the new version you no longer
02:09 - have the option the only one you get is
02:11 - human name
02:12 - so continuing the unity 2020 wizard over
02:15 - here you see some assembly options
02:18 - this is for more advanced use cases
02:20 - where you want to unload some external
02:21 - libraries
02:23 - so in most cases just leave everything
02:24 - on default and head on next
02:26 - then you've got a list of types again
02:28 - for more advanced use case where you
02:29 - want to add your own custom types as
02:31 - nodes
02:32 - so again in the beginning just click on
02:34 - generate
02:37 - all right so after a bit everything is
02:39 - generated and we have bolt fully
02:41 - installed and ready to be used in our
02:42 - unity 2010 project
02:44 - now these last two things that we saw
02:46 - the assemblies and types
02:47 - on ent 2021 they are instead on the
02:50 - project settings so you go up here into
02:51 - edit
02:52 - then down into project settings and then
02:54 - here on the left select the visual
02:56 - scripting tab
02:57 - and up here you've got both instead of
02:59 - assemblies they are simply called the
03:00 - node library
03:01 - so you can expand and you see all the
03:03 - various assemblies so this is where you
03:05 - would add things like for example if you
03:06 - wanted to use cinemachine you would add
03:08 - that assembling here
03:09 - and same thing for the types are up here
03:11 - the tab options you can add all the
03:13 - types that you want
03:14 - so in unity version 2021 these are on
03:16 - the project settings so you would do all
03:18 - those changes and then regenerate on the
03:20 - units
03:20 - okay back into unity 2020 now when you
03:23 - start actually using it
03:25 - in order to make our visual script you
03:27 - go into add component
03:29 - and again this is a small difference
03:30 - between unt 2020 and 2021
03:33 - in 2020 you go under bolt and then you
03:36 - add a flow machine
03:37 - whereas over here in unity 2021 instead
03:40 - when you add the component you go down
03:42 - here
03:42 - under visual scripting and then you add
03:44 - a script machine
03:46 - so where previously you had a flow
03:47 - machine right now you've got a script
03:49 - machine
03:50 - this is just a name change but they are
03:51 - the exact same thing
03:53 - then in order to create a graph in
03:55 - version 2020 they are called macros or
03:57 - flow macros
03:58 - whereas in version 2021 they are simply
04:00 - called graphs
04:01 - but again just a name change they're all
04:03 - the exact same thing
04:05 - so you just click on new and it creates
04:08 - the visual script
04:09 - so here in unity 2020 as you double
04:12 - click on the flow macro it opens up the
04:14 - flow graph window
04:16 - and in version 2021 when you open it the
04:18 - first time you do it's actually going to
04:20 - handle a bunch of processing
04:22 - and then it opens up the same graph
04:23 - window now there is a slight visual
04:26 - change
04:27 - but again everything still works exactly
04:29 - the same now another difference is over
04:30 - here in unity 2020 you have two other
04:33 - visual scripting windows as separate
04:35 - windows
04:36 - so you go up here into window and you
04:38 - separately open up the graph inspector
04:40 - and the other one is the variables so
04:42 - these are two separate windows so for
04:44 - example you can
04:45 - dock them anywhere so dock them down
04:47 - there and there you go you've got these
04:48 - separate windows
04:50 - also still in unity 2020 you have the
04:52 - graph window
04:53 - and right now it looks like this and if
04:55 - you maximize it it automatically opens
04:57 - up the graph window
04:59 - and the variable inspector however it
05:02 - will only automatically show these two
05:03 - tabs if the monitor resolution is big
05:05 - enough
05:06 - so they only show up after a certain
05:08 - size so if you have a small monitor
05:10 - resolution they might not automatically
05:12 - show up
05:13 - so if they don't then you need to
05:14 - manually use the dot separate windows
05:16 - so if i play around with the size of my
05:18 - ent window if it's big like this shows
05:20 - up those two and if i make it quite a
05:22 - bit smaller
05:23 - if there you go those disappear whereas
05:25 - over here on unity 2021
05:27 - first of all there are no separate
05:28 - windows so if you go into window you do
05:31 - not see the graph inspector or the graph
05:32 - variables
05:33 - so the only window you have is just the
05:35 - graph window
05:37 - and this one always shows the graph
05:39 - inspector and the variables window all
05:41 - the time
05:42 - so regardless of resolution regardless
05:43 - of the size of this window no matter how
05:45 - big or small you make it
05:46 - it will always show those then there's
05:48 - also a few small changes on the nodes
05:50 - themselves so for example in unity 2020
05:53 - you can add a branch node so this one
05:56 - takes a condition and runs something if
05:58 - it's true and something else if it's
06:00 - false
06:00 - whereas over here on unity 2021 instead
06:03 - of being named branch it is named an if
06:05 - so again the same thing
06:06 - boolean with a true and a fonts but now
06:09 - instead of a branch it's named an
06:10 - if so again the functionality is only
06:13 - exactly the same it's just a name change
06:15 - another node difference is over here on
06:17 - unity 2020
06:18 - you have what's called the soft node so
06:21 - this one represents the current game
06:23 - object
06:24 - whereas in version 2021 this is instead
06:27 - called the this node
06:28 - so again they represent the same thing
06:29 - this one is still this same game object
06:32 - so previously named itself and now it's
06:34 - this then another difference is when you
06:36 - add the component
06:37 - you make it a state machine so this one
06:40 - again
06:41 - so these ones are still named the same
06:42 - they're both named the state machine
06:44 - the main difference is again this one is
06:46 - called the state macro whereas this one
06:47 - is a state graph
06:48 - and as you create the state graph the
06:50 - graph window is just the same so in 2020
06:52 - and 2021 they all look exactly the same
06:54 - now another difference is when working
06:56 - with division scripting through c
06:57 - sharp and the differences are on the
06:59 - namespaces so over here on unity 2020
07:02 - you add using bolt that's what you add
07:07 - whereas in version 2021 you are using
07:09 - unity dot
07:10 - visual scripting another change is also
07:13 - the new 2021 visual scripting
07:15 - also has some better built-in support
07:17 - for the new input system
07:19 - okay so those are the main changes as
07:21 - you can see they're all pre-miners so
07:23 - every tutorial that you can find that
07:24 - was made using bond you can very easily
07:27 - get it working with the 2021 visual
07:29 - scripting version
07:30 - if you want to learn more about visual
07:31 - scripting check out my complete course
07:33 - where you'll learn how to make three
07:34 - complete games
07:35 - starting off with a simple platformer
07:37 - game then moving on to a more complex
07:39 - action rpg with tons of features like
07:41 - multiple weapons
07:42 - enemies dungeons shops skills and so on
07:44 - and finally the unless game which is a
07:46 - really awesome fps that teaches you how
07:48 - to use visual scripting in 3d with tons
07:51 - of weapons
07:51 - a really nice hook shot ability and a
07:53 - really awesome boss fight
07:55 - check out the phone course with the link
