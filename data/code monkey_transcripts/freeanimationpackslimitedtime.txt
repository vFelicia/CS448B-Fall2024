01:21 - than just the three packs then this is a
01:22 - great quick sale
01:24 - for me i've been researching characters
01:25 - and animations more and more lately so
01:27 - this sale really comes at the perfect
01:29 - time
01:30 - you can browse around the full list and
01:31 - see there's tons of variety from these
01:33 - three developers
01:34 - so from kevin iglesias you got a whole
01:36 - bunch of basic animations some archers
01:38 - pistol
01:39 - soldier rifle and so on then down here
01:42 - from explosive you got a whole bunch of
01:44 - melee rpg mage and so on lots of great
01:47 - animations
01:48 - and then down here for we make the game
01:50 - these are some really awesome stylized
01:52 - animations
01:53 - i've seen a bunch of these in some sales
01:55 - but i don't have any yet so i might get
01:56 - some of these for using a future melee
01:58 - video
01:59 - and of course all of these are humanoid
02:01 - animations which means you can easily
02:03 - use them with any humanoid characters
02:05 - i cover the process of animation
02:06 - retargeting in the stern assets video
02:09 - you can essentially use any character
02:10 - with any of these animations
02:12 - so here i've got a project and i import
02:14 - those three asset packs
02:16 - so this one is the free basic motions
02:18 - pack
02:19 - as you can see tons and tons of
02:20 - animations this one is really useful for
02:22 - pretty much any project
02:24 - so you've got some jumping falling a
02:26 - bunch of sitting a bunch of basic emotes
02:28 - a bunch of people turning around
02:30 - everywhere swimming dying
02:31 - walking crouch walking normal running
02:34 - talking and so on
02:35 - tons and tons of animations and as an
02:37 - example of animation retargeting over
02:39 - here is the animation being applied to a
02:41 - completely different character so this
02:42 - is from a completely different asset
02:44 - pack
02:44 - all you need for this work is really to
02:46 - make sure that the animations are being
02:48 - marked as humanoid which all of these
02:50 - are already
02:50 - like that and then you just need to use
02:52 - the avatar for the actual mesh that
02:54 - you're using
02:55 - so here i'm using the animations from
02:56 - this pack and the character and the
02:58 - avatar from a different pack
03:00 - and yeah that's all it takes and works
03:01 - great so you can apply any of these
03:03 - animations with any humanoid character
03:05 - so that's the basic motions pack already
03:07 - tons and tons of things
03:08 - definitely get this one then over here
03:10 - is the crafting pack
03:12 - this one the demo scene actually has an
03:14 - issue where it's using a second camera
03:15 - for the ui
03:16 - but this was made before urp was around
03:19 - so if you're using urp and you see a
03:20 - grey screen with just ui you can easily
03:22 - fix this
03:23 - just go ahead and select the ui camera
03:25 - so the gui camera
03:27 - then over here on the render time
03:28 - instead of being based set it as overlay
03:30 - and then on the base camera
03:32 - just go down here on the camera stack
03:33 - and just add the other camera
03:35 - so with that yep it works perfectly also
03:37 - when you do in case you see
03:38 - everything else being completely white
03:40 - that's also another issue that is very
03:42 - easy to solve just on the material
03:43 - itself just make sure you disable the
03:45 - emission
03:46 - so just do that and here is the demo
03:48 - this is a really cool demo
03:49 - so you've got tons of buttons for
03:51 - playing all the various animations
03:53 - for example the cheater animation pretty
03:54 - simple cheer another cheer
03:56 - then you've got buttons to equip all the
03:58 - various tools for example get the hammer
04:00 - he picks up the hammer then all of the
04:02 - various hammer
04:03 - animations so hammer on a table hammer
04:05 - on the wall
04:06 - really nice then just put away the
04:09 - hammer then let's say pick up a shovel
04:11 - and start digging and just dig and yep
04:14 - this one has quite a lot of awesome
04:16 - animations
04:17 - you also got take food so receiving some
04:19 - food then eating it
04:21 - really a lot of stuff if you got any
04:23 - kind of rpg or survival game this one
04:25 - can be insanely useful
04:26 - even just pick up an object overhead
04:28 - like that really nice
04:30 - alright so that's the crafting free
04:32 - asset pack this one has a really cool
04:33 - demo definitely check it out
04:35 - and finally here is the free oriental
04:37 - swordpack
04:38 - this one actually has the mesh with the
04:40 - animations using a generic
04:42 - ray so just as soon as you import it
04:44 - won't work automatically
04:45 - but if you browse on the project folder
04:47 - over here you can see there are some
04:48 - with the generic animations and then
04:50 - you've got the humanoid so if you want
04:52 - to do animation retargeting make sure
04:53 - you're using one of these models so
04:56 - these ones and they've got
04:57 - all kinds of animation like these tons
04:58 - of them so here after making that change
05:00 - i retargeted into my custom character
05:03 - and yep it works pretty great so i just
05:04 - had another free sword from another
05:06 - asset pack
05:07 - and yep all of them looks really nice so
05:10 - tons of great sort of animations all of
05:11 - them really flashy you can definitely
05:13 - add a bunch more effects and with this
05:14 - you would have a great base for making
05:16 - any kind of action game
05:18 - alright so those are the three packs you
