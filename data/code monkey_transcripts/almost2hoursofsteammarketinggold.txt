05:11 - our games how to get more wish list more
05:12 - sales and all of that uh so yeah I'm
05:15 - guessing all of you I have seen the
05:16 - previous two videos that I already did
05:17 - with Chris so one of them was on the uh
05:20 - kind of like a rough high level overview
05:22 - on how to do marketing on Steam and
05:24 - second one on analyzing various steam
05:25 - pages and what to do what steam pages
05:27 - are doing right what they're doing wrong
05:29 - and what you can improve in order to
05:30 - basically increase your odds of getting
05:32 - more and more wish list to find success
05:34 - uh but yeah just in case you haven't
05:35 - seen it so Chris uh go ahead and give
05:37 - yourself a quick intro on who you are
05:39 - and what you do hey thanks Code Monkey
05:42 - for having me on for so many times we've
05:45 - just been hanging out this been like the
05:47 - Code Monkey week me and Hugo just
05:49 - hanging out uh so I write a blog uh
05:52 - called how tomarket agame.com I do some
05:54 - talks um and yeah so what I do is uh I
05:58 - take a very um kind of scientific almost
06:01 - like Curious look at the market how
06:04 - Steam Works um I don't I don't know
06:08 - anything so I just kind of look at the
06:10 - data to kind of figure out like well
06:12 - what is actually working I interview
06:14 - users people who have Steam games on I
06:16 - interview uh people who shop on Steam so
06:19 - I'm really just trying to figure out
06:21 - like how steam actually works and I
06:23 - publish all my findings on how to Market
06:24 - a game.com so uh I also put together
06:28 - some courses that teach everything I
06:30 - know so I write a weekly blog which you
06:32 - can get at how Market a game.com free uh
06:35 - for that Weekly blog but then it's a lot
06:38 - of content like every week for I don't
06:40 - know I think I've been doing this four
06:41 - or five years it's so much and there's
06:43 - so many things that are like just half
06:45 - thoughts and not full thoughts so I
06:47 - compile them into a
06:49 - course and uh part of the reason I'm
06:51 - talking to Hugo so much this week is
06:53 - they're on sale uh so I put all my
06:55 - courses on sale this uh these this

07:42 - I'm here to answer your questions about
07:43 - steam marketing I know it's confusing I
07:46 - know that none this stuff makes sense
07:47 - some things that should make sense the
07:49 - opposite is actually true so that's why
07:51 - I'm here to answer any questions you
07:52 - might have about the courses about how
07:54 - to Market a game on Steam um I don't
07:58 - know any other advice need I might be
08:00 - able to answer gardening tips whatever
08:02 - I'm here for you all yeah that sounds
08:05 - that sounds really good and actually one
08:06 - thing that I wanted to start with is
08:08 - something that I actually didn't cover
08:09 - in the those two videos which I think is
08:11 - actually really awesome it's a page that
08:12 - you have on your website like I said
08:14 - your blog is really awesome like I
08:15 - actually checked my my email list to see
08:17 - when did I start reading your blog and
08:19 - it was like February of 2018 so I've
08:21 - been reading it for like six years so
08:23 - yeah that is that's when can't doing it
08:26 - that long dang yeah it's been quite a
08:28 - while and I've definitely learn a lot
08:29 - from it uh yeah and one of the main
08:31 - pages that I really like is your page
08:34 - about the uh let me just switch the
08:36 - thing it's your page about the
08:37 - benchmarks where you have all kinds of
08:40 - benchmarks and that it shows like how
08:42 - many wish lists you should have like
08:44 - what is organic visibility like the
08:46 - number of wish list how do they convert
08:47 - and so on so can you just go through
08:49 - that page because I think that one is
08:50 - really awesome like it has some really
08:52 - uh excellent information so can you go
08:54 - through that and speak about some
08:55 - takeaways for people absolutely so
08:58 - here's the thing is you can kind of get
09:00 - comparison itis you know um you might
09:03 - hear some game that made a million
09:05 - dollars and you're like God I am nowhere
09:06 - near making a million dollars and so
09:08 - makes people feel bad you know it's like
09:10 - God I'm trying my best here and I'm just
09:12 - not doing the numbers and I I felt the
09:15 - same way I was like well what is normal
09:17 - people always ask me like is this good
09:19 - is this normal I just launched my steam
09:20 - page I got this manyi wish list is that
09:22 - normal so what I did was I started this
09:24 - page um if you go to how Market a
09:26 - game.com benchmarks I do surveys all the
09:30 - time frequently you know like hey how
09:32 - many wish lists did you get or uh you
09:34 - know I just did one just now for the
09:35 - steam Festival steam
09:37 - nextfest the one we just had in June and
09:40 - 40 people responded because I have a big
09:41 - community and I'm very I trust your data
09:44 - so much I don't share anything that you
09:45 - don't want me to share and so I've kind
09:47 - of built this reputation where people
09:48 - can share their data with me and so I've
09:50 - done surveys over years and um I
09:53 - compiled all the different reports in
09:55 - this one site called how Market a
09:57 - game.com Benchmark so I go through kind
10:00 - of the the timeline of when you launch
10:02 - your game so you know when you launch
10:04 - your steam page what is typical wish
10:06 - list numbers and what I do is I base it
10:08 - off
10:09 - of Revenue so I assign um different
10:13 - metals because sometimes and here's the
10:16 - thing um it's okay if you're just a solo
10:18 - Dev making a game and you release it in
10:21 - six months or something your expected
10:23 - revenue is much lower than a uh studio
10:28 - with like1 people AAA Graphics been
10:31 - building for three years you have very
10:33 - different expectations of what's worth
10:34 - your time and so I try not to judge and
10:36 - say this is good or bad I I i' put gold
10:39 - medal silver diamond again I tried to
10:42 - make it as non accusatory as possible
10:45 - because again we're all on a different
10:46 - Journey here and so what I do is I base
10:48 - it off of Revenue um so all these things
10:51 - you might see like oh this is the
10:53 - typical tier so every report that you'll
10:56 - see I Break It Down based off of what's
10:58 - gold silver you know all the all all the
11:01 - range of the metals there so what's
11:03 - organic visibility like if you don't do
11:05 - any marketing steam promotes your game
11:08 - day and day out sometimes it comes from
11:10 - YouTube all these different things so I
11:11 - did a survey of like hey if you got
11:13 - covered by a big streamer don't talk
11:14 - focus on that time pick a week where
11:16 - nothing big was happening just a resting
11:18 - rate it's called a resting wish list
11:20 - rate or organic visibility and I just
11:22 - wanted to find out like what's typical
11:23 - so we did that um we did uh what's this
11:26 - one uh wish list uh deletes like are so
11:29 - paranoid they're like oh my God so many
11:31 - people deleted my thing what's normal so
11:33 - I looked at how many deletes are normal
11:34 - for a typical week um you know what's a
11:38 - a good median playtime because I one of
11:41 - my theories is that the most
11:42 - underreported most under observed um
11:46 - stat that Indies aren't looking at is
11:48 - how long your demo is being played
11:50 - because you can learn a lot about how
11:52 - interesting your game is and so I did a
11:54 - big survey about how long games
11:55 - typically play spoiler alert if your
11:58 - game is 20 25 minutes median not average
12:01 - everybody says what about the average
12:03 - doesn't matter it's the median play time
12:05 - if it's 25 minutes or greater that's a
12:07 - good sign that means your game is
12:08 - engaging um higher up the big top
12:11 - sellers typically have an hour two hour
12:14 - median play time for a demo so uh that's
12:17 - kind of the stats there uh Game launch
12:19 - what how many wish lists do you need for
12:20 - launch and then uh what's an expected
12:23 - conversion rate within a short period of
12:25 - time you know within like first month
12:27 - and some of this data I didn't do it was
12:29 - uh from I link out to other sources like
12:31 - game discover Co I'll link off to their
12:33 - blog because they Simon Carlos has done
12:36 - this research so it's like if he's done
12:38 - it I'm not GNA do it again um and then
12:39 - reviews like um uh how how many sales
12:43 - per reviews typical stuff that so I try
12:45 - and cover at every stage you're at in
12:47 - your marketing and your game development
12:49 - kind of like just benchmarks like oh am
12:51 - I good or not and the way to use this is
12:53 - not to make you feel bad it's kind of
12:56 - I'll be honest not every game's gonna
12:58 - sell well it just that's just the way
12:59 - the world is but I want you to
13:01 - understand this stuff so if you're like
13:03 - man I am everything I try I am on the
13:06 - lower end the lower tier I just want you
13:08 - to have that
13:09 - expectation so that when it's time for
13:11 - you to launch you're not like oh this is
13:13 - gonna be a big seller this's gonna be a
13:14 - big seller and then it kind of doesn't
13:17 - do so well I I just want you to have
13:18 - that expectation the other reason I do
13:20 - this is sometimes it's like people like
13:22 - well I'm gonna delay my game a year and
13:24 - polish it up some more I you know if
13:26 - your numbers aren't good I'd say ship
13:28 - the game start your next one you know I
13:30 - kind of do that just so that it's like I
13:33 - I don't think it's ever wise to delay
13:34 - and spend more time on a game that's
13:36 - just not connecting like if if you're
13:38 - trying all these stats and you look at
13:39 - all these and and your game keeps
13:41 - hitting the kind of lowest tier there's
13:42 - just something that's just not
13:44 - connecting with people and that's fine
13:46 - but just don't spend more time on this
13:48 - keep hoping that you're going to get to
13:49 - those higher te I just typically don't
13:51 - see that happening so with that uh any
13:53 - questions Hugo or anybody from the chat
13:56 - yeah right away on there I would say
13:58 - yeah what you were saying about the the
13:59 - goals yeah it's definitely uh uh like
14:02 - you don't have to get to uh the diamond
14:04 - level in order to find success like it
14:06 - all depends on what's your cost are like
14:08 - for example in my case I'm a solo in
14:10 - developer so for me even the bronze tier
14:11 - or the silver tier is more than enough
14:13 - for me to make a living whereas if I was
14:15 - like a triple indie game with like 30
14:17 - people working on it then yeah you
14:18 - definitely need the diamond so yeah it's
14:20 - something that I've mentioned many times
14:21 - on my channel which is how basically how
14:23 - the definition of success that's really
14:25 - up to you to Define so some people in
14:26 - success selling a million copies a th000
14:29 - copies 10,000 copies and some people
14:30 - just publishing something is Success so
14:32 - yeah I would definitely say always
14:34 - always keep that in mind because yeah
14:36 - basically it's up to you to Define what
14:38 - exactly is your goal and what exactly is
14:39 - the definition of success so yeah I mean
14:42 - one thing just to add on to that I hate
14:44 - Reddit for this one fact that like when
14:46 - you look on the Reddit rgame Dev they
14:48 - always talk about my game failed it
14:50 - failed they always use that failed and
14:51 - they always make it all cast with an
14:53 - exclamation point at the end I hate that
14:54 - word because it's like all right so what
14:56 - it's uh you're not failed you You
14:58 - released a that's really hard a lot of
15:00 - what it is is just like hey it's a
15:03 - stepping stone it's like hey this game
15:04 - didn't underperformed my next one might
15:07 - do better it's not a failure it's just
15:08 - like there's a ladder to success and
15:11 - sometimes even if it didn't sell a lot
15:13 - it might be enough based on the amount
15:14 - of time and effort you invested in it so
15:16 - I try never to say failed that's why I
15:19 - like hey everybody gets a medal it's
15:21 - okay yeah I agree and actually uh here's
15:24 - a related question so uh an interesting
15:26 - question by twitz uh I'm finished ing a
15:29 - three-month little project do I still
15:30 - need to have 7,000 wish lists even
15:32 - though my game is really small am I
15:33 - doomed to fail her if I don't have that
15:35 - 7,000 and for that yeah I would say very
15:36 - much the the same thing which is how
15:39 - like your first projects like a quick
15:40 - project the goal can be just to learn so
15:42 - if you learn it doesn't really matter if
15:44 - you get 7,000 wish list if you find
15:46 - financial success and so on if you just
15:47 - learn quite a lot from it that can in
15:49 - itself be a I would I would call it a
15:52 - success so yeah would you agree with
15:54 - that uh Chris absolutely I mean like one
15:57 - of the things I teach is it's it's a
16:00 - long journey and your first couple games
16:02 - just don't do well that's just natural I
16:04 - don't understand why people expect your
16:06 - first game to do well nobody knows who
16:07 - you are nobody's ever played anything
16:09 - and and just to back this up so this is
16:11 - one of the Articles from the benchmarks
16:13 - page and I looked at when you launch
16:15 - your steam page how many wish lists do
16:16 - you get you know like a two weeks after
16:18 - you push the launch button what's
16:19 - typical wish list to earn that period
16:22 - And what I found was and I grafted here
16:24 - each bar represents a different game the
16:26 - games that had the highest um Spike you
16:29 - know at the beginning those first two
16:30 - weeks are games every bar that is red is
16:33 - a game that had a second like this is a
16:36 - developer second or third or game in
16:38 - other words like this wasn't their first
16:39 - so if there was a previous game I tagged
16:42 - it as a red bar you'll notice that most
16:44 - of the games that get these huge
16:46 - launches of their steam page had
16:48 - previous games and here's the thing is
16:50 - you're you're you're building a little
16:52 - stepping stone for your game so even if
16:54 - this game doesn't do well there are
16:56 - still going to be people who buy it and
16:58 - play it and look at your steam page so
17:00 - you're not starting at zero so when you
17:01 - do your second game all that traffic to
17:04 - your first game will go to your second
17:06 - game and you're just like kind of
17:08 - rolling that snowball bigger and bigger
17:10 - now you you sometimes if you change
17:13 - genre too much it doesn't convert as
17:15 - well if you stick to the same genre of
17:16 - game it it converts better but overall
17:19 - there's it is okay to start small and
17:22 - then your next one gets bigger and
17:23 - bigger and bigger so don't I I like your
17:26 - attitude quick project moving on next
17:28 - one great attitude this is the right
17:30 - attitude to have everybody everybody
17:31 - should have the same attitude yeah I
17:33 - would agree I mean that is definitely
17:34 - one of the things that I've heard you
17:35 - say many times and I fully agree which
17:37 - is how Indies don't make enough games
17:39 - like so many Indies they just make one
17:40 - game and they quit and yeah I mean I
17:42 - think you find so much value by making
17:44 - more and more games like every game you
17:45 - do you're going to learn quite a lot so
17:47 - the next one is likely going to be
17:48 - better and yeah I do think that people
17:51 - possibly underestimate the power of
17:53 - experience they just expect the first
17:54 - game to be a super hit and don't really
17:57 - don't really pay attention to the fact
17:58 - fact that okay your first one might be
18:00 - slightly weak but then your second one
18:01 - is going to be better and like your
18:02 - fifth or sixth one those are going to be
18:03 - really good so yeah I'm a huge fan of
18:07 - making multiple games per Studio I do
18:08 - think that is a really great thing
18:11 - yeah and yeah so here's another uh
18:14 - really interesting question uh oh so
18:17 - this one
18:21 - um uh yeah it's a interesting question
18:24 - about basally the price of the game
18:26 - versus wish list so what is the optimal
18:28 - wish list value for a game under five
18:30 - category so basically do games that are
18:32 - cheaper is that uh a factor in how many
18:35 - wish lists you need like if you need a
18:37 - AAA game like uh you mentioned on the
18:39 - video on how uh for new and training I
18:41 - think you mentioned who was getting
18:42 - $8,000 in gross revenue so technically
18:45 - that would mean that you don't need as
18:47 - many wish lists if your game is more on
18:48 - the expensive side and on the other hand
18:50 - if your game is cheaper you would need
18:51 - more wish lists have you seen any data
18:54 - on that like does price relate to wish
18:56 - list in any
18:57 - way I have haven't um done a specific
19:01 - price to wish just because there's so
19:02 - many factors um Let me let me I'm
19:06 - pulling up a blog post that I did a
19:07 - while ago and I just looked at average
19:10 - price per game and you're kind of right
19:14 - about the price in the wish list so here
19:16 - here's the deal the steam algorithm once
19:19 - you put your game on sale you release
19:20 - your game does not care about wish lists
19:22 - they don't care about wish list
19:23 - conversion they don't care about
19:24 - wishlist you know amount what they care
19:27 - about is dollars earned that's it they
19:29 - don't care how you get there you could
19:31 - if you had one game one copy of your
19:34 - game cost a million dollars like if you
19:36 - if if one person bought it and they
19:38 - spent a million dollars on your game
19:40 - that would look the same in the eyes of
19:42 - the algorithm as a game that was priced
19:44 - a$1 and sold a million copies those
19:47 - those two games would look exactly the
19:49 - same in the eyes of the steam algorithm
19:51 - that's how you have to think about it
19:52 - now those are two very extreme examples
19:54 - but that's what you have to consider and
19:57 - so a lot of genres can price their game
19:59 - higher like forx deep deep strategy
20:02 - games can price their games much higher
20:04 - they can be like 30 or $40 okay it's
20:07 - much harder if you price your game under
20:08 - five doll to sell enough copies at a
20:11 - high enough price and um so with that
20:14 - going in yes um that is why a lot of
20:18 - games um that are top sellers cost more
20:22 - because it's just it's easier to raise
20:24 - the price than it is to find another
20:26 - thousand people to buy your game um and
20:29 - so when I looked at the data um of it's
20:33 - It's a complicated I just read the whole
20:35 - blog post let me see if I can find it um
20:38 - a nice easy way this graph's really tiny
20:40 - I understand but basically what I found
20:42 - was Indies are not raising their price
20:44 - enough okay so AAA games way back like
20:48 - uh 10 years ago most PC um AAA Studios
20:52 - were like ah just dump your game on
20:54 - Steam they they would discount it so low
20:56 - the price was so low and then steam then
20:58 - uh trip blade was like oh you know what
21:00 - uh we can charge more for these games
21:02 - and people will still buy them so
21:03 - they've raised their prices if I I
21:05 - looked every year with the median prices
21:07 - for different games each year tripa
21:09 - raises their price all the time higher
21:12 - and higher prices but Indies are stuck
21:14 - at this low price of like they've even
21:17 - dropped the price they've even over time
21:19 - despite inflation they've still lowered
21:21 - the price of the average indie game so
21:24 - my thought is you should always be
21:25 - trying to increase the price just a
21:27 - little bit based on the previous year so
21:30 - look at all the games that I've released
21:32 - recently that are similar to yours and
21:34 - add 10 to 20% because we should be we as
21:37 - an indie Community should be pushing our
21:39 - prices higher um the top Indie studios
21:42 - are raising their prices but new Indies
21:44 - are their price is very low and this is
21:47 - looking across all the games that have
21:49 - released each year so um just search my
21:52 - blog for price it's it's kind of a
21:53 - complicated blog post but search for
21:55 - price and I I I go into all that so in
21:57 - general raise your price in these bounce
22:00 - yeah price is definitely an interesting
22:02 - point and I guess related to that
22:04 - related to triaa games so here's a
22:06 - question on basically uh when a very
22:09 - large game gets uh revealed gets
22:11 - released or they're going to put out
22:12 - some DLC and something basically when
22:14 - there's a big triaa game release does
22:16 - that affect Indies in any way like
22:18 - should you as an new developer basically
22:20 - try to dodge your release date based on
22:23 - different uh triple League games that
22:25 - might be coming out around that time or
22:27 - does it really not matter
22:30 - no I don't I think this is a game that
22:32 - Indies like to play but it's it's not
22:35 - smart um I'm looking up a blog post um
22:37 - about this so um Indies love to pretend
22:41 - and I think they get this from movies
22:43 - you know um movies like big theater
22:47 - releases if you read those trades those
22:51 - uh you know the news about them they're
22:52 - always like oh we we shifted the date of
22:53 - the release of our movie because we
22:55 - didn't want to conflict with this other
22:56 - movie but these are like Titans fighting
22:59 - okay they're fighting and so I think a
23:01 - lot of Indies and a lot of PR companies
23:02 - if you hire a PR Company they're going
23:03 - to do this too so a lot of Indies and PR
23:05 - companies will do this thing where
23:06 - they're like oh well this game's
23:08 - releasing so we should shift your game
23:09 - we are tiny little bacterium on the back
23:13 - of a Colossus we do not matter they do
23:16 - not affect us um and one of the best
23:18 - things that I've
23:19 - seen is um let me see if I can find it
23:22 - so Starfield launched okay big Starfield
23:25 - launched one of the biggest launches of
23:26 - the year and this little game called
23:29 - chill quum was like we're just going to
23:30 - launch a day after Starfield all right
23:33 - and so what happens is and this is what
23:35 - Indies don't understand is um these
23:39 - these ranking charts are your best
23:40 - visibility steam itself is the best
23:42 - visibility not the Press not streamers
23:45 - steam itself okay and so these widgets
23:49 - like this one popular upcoming is that
23:50 - the one yeah this is popular upcoming um
23:53 - they only pick the top 10 games that are
23:55 - releasing soon now if you are releasing
23:59 - during a triaa launch like chill
24:01 - aquarium was doing small indie game
24:03 - launched with just over 5,000 wish lists
24:06 - here's uh Starfield every other Indie
24:08 - every other game doesn't know what we
24:10 - know which is it doesn't matter if
24:12 - Triple A so all the other Indies were
24:13 - like oh starfields launching let's move
24:16 - our date oh so scared of Starfield and
24:18 - they moved their dates so all these
24:19 - games left the launch window chill
24:21 - quam's like I don't care I'm strong I'm
24:24 - brave I know that it doesn't matter I'm
24:27 - smart about that and so the only two
24:29 - games on popular up coming that week
24:30 - were chil aquarium and Starfield there
24:32 - was a lot of room there's 10 slots so
24:35 - because everybody was so scared and
24:37 - moved out of the chil quarium zone or
24:39 - out of the Starfield Zone uh chil
24:42 - quarium had like front page featuring
24:43 - for a lot longer than if they had picked
24:45 - another week so don't play the game
24:48 - where you're like well this Triple A
24:49 - Game's launching you do not have to
24:51 - worry about that and people don't
24:53 - understand here's the big thing that
24:54 - people don't understand is that even a
24:57 - big AA launch is a tiny drop in the
25:01 - world of steam there are so many people
25:03 - playing games on Steam you don't even
25:05 - conceive of how big this game these
25:07 - games are the you know games in general
25:09 - let me show you I looked and I saw like
25:11 - well how many people were actually
25:13 - playing Starfield right Starfield
25:16 - supposedly the biggest game on Steam in
25:19 - the world right I did the the analysis I
25:21 - looked at what was the peak Starfield
25:24 - play time what how many people are
25:26 - playing Starfield at the peak look at
25:27 - this it's this little tiny blue bar the
25:29 - red this big red circle is everything
25:31 - else on Steam people playing every other
25:33 - type of game only three. 4% of people
25:38 - were playing Starfield and this is
25:39 - supposedly the biggest game that's going
25:40 - to ruin everything for everybody else it
25:42 - doesn't matter it just doesn't matter we
25:45 - are so tiny and steam is so big you
25:48 - cannot like take over steam with a
25:51 - single AAA launch so don't worry about
25:54 - what's launching just do not worry about
25:56 - it at our scale it doesn't matter
25:59 - yeah the the size of steam is definitely
26:01 - something that people seem to forget
26:03 - just how huge steam is I mean I think
26:04 - steam has like 140 million monthly
26:06 - active users so that's an insane amount
26:08 - of people and yeah even if a AAA game
26:10 - comes out and it's a mega hit and sells
26:12 - like I don't know 5 million copies I'm
26:13 - pretty sure that's a mega hit on Steam
26:15 - even so that's 5 million out of 140
26:17 - million so that's a ton of people who
26:19 - might be playing some other games so
26:21 - yeah it is quite a quite a massive
26:24 - amount it is Tiny how much those AAA
26:26 - games impact steam tiny
26:28 - so don't even worry about it yeah you we
26:30 - are too small to
26:32 - matter okay so here's an interesting
26:35 - question like on the on the video you
26:37 - talked about uh how the announcement is
26:39 - a really important thing it's like your
26:41 - golden ticket and you're basically going
26:42 - around trying to cash in that ticket and
26:44 - how you mentioned how you should
26:46 - basically announce the game with a
26:48 - announcement trailer so here's developer
26:50 - who apparently they're already starting
26:51 - off quite well so with posts on Reddit
26:53 - and Tik Tok getting 15K views and a
26:55 - bunch of members on Discord and now
26:56 - they're planning a kickstar and and in
26:58 - terms of doing some marketing for their
27:00 - first trailer should they uh make a
27:03 - highquality cinematic trailer to launch
27:04 - a campaign or showing gameplay like out
27:06 - of those two which one would you think
27:08 - is best for making basically the
27:10 - announcement trailer gameplay versus
27:12 - cinematic oh um so just to clarify and
27:16 - I'll say make a baby answer while I'm
27:18 - talking this is the first time anybody
27:21 - has ever heard of your game first first
27:23 - I mean they mentioned how the post is
27:25 - already doing well on Reddit and Tik Tok
27:26 - so I think it's already
27:28 - announced I don't know if that's what I
27:31 - don't know it sounds like you've already
27:32 - announced with a trailer I that I don't
27:35 - understand I I think they're talking
27:36 - about the trailer for the kickstarter so
27:38 - I think that is
27:39 - roughly but just in general do you
27:41 - recommend like uh cinematic trailers for
27:44 - Indie devs because I got to say that me
27:46 - personally I'm not a a fan of cinematic
27:48 - trailers I want to see gameplay but I
27:49 - don't know if that is how most uh shoers
27:52 - on seem feel so I don't know yeah here
27:54 - here's here's in general my thought on
27:56 - cinematic trailers I don't like I think
27:58 - they're too expensive they don't people
28:00 - don't like them on Steam they're not
28:02 - great okay so and especially I don't
28:05 - know Kickstarter also preferes I'm not a
28:07 - Kickstarter I I've never studied um I
28:09 - haven't studied kickstar I don't know it
28:12 - in general though my theory on on
28:14 - kickstarters people are suspicious
28:15 - because they've been burned by all these
28:16 - games that go nowhere like they're
28:19 - vaporware and so if you come out with a
28:21 - very strong cinematic trailer that
28:24 - doesn't show gameplay people are like oh
28:26 - they just are really good in making
28:27 - cinematics
28:28 - we want to see gameplay to prove that
28:30 - these are real developers who can really
28:32 - make the game so that's why I don't like
28:34 - cinematic trailers I also don't like
28:35 - cinematic trailers on your steam page
28:37 - because people are like what's the
28:39 - gameplay what's the gameplay because a
28:40 - cinematic trailer could be any genre and
28:43 - what steam players want and gamers in
28:45 - general is they want to know the genre
28:47 - they have genres that they like and they
28:48 - have genres that they don't like and so
28:50 - they're trying to determine is this a
28:51 - game that I like they don't care if
28:53 - there's the seven keys oftler and the
28:56 - king of the land of rega
28:58 - who's the son of sim they don't care
29:01 - about that until they know the genre
29:03 - then when they know the genre they're
29:04 - like now tell me about the seven keys of
29:06 - AMT I want to find out about the seven
29:08 - keys so I find Indies get a little too
29:11 - lore heavy a little too cinematic heavy
29:13 - and people like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
29:15 - yeah yeah give it to me and if you get
29:17 - an animated trailer or a cinematic
29:19 - trailer it those cost a lot I mean
29:21 - especially if you have to hire somebody
29:22 - else out so I don't like cinematic
29:24 - trailers the one exception for a
29:26 - cinematic trailer that I think worth it
29:29 - is if you get into these shows like
29:31 - summer games Fest by Jeff Keeley or the
29:34 - PC Gamer show those the cinematic
29:36 - trailer might work because that audience
29:38 - is captive they are watching the show
29:41 - and they're like I want to find out new
29:43 - games so they are sitting there they
29:44 - can't fast forward because those shows
29:45 - are typically live broadcast so they're
29:47 - sitting and they're their their
29:49 - attention is locked in that's the one
29:51 - time I say a cinematic trailer is good
29:53 - every other time I say gameplay gameplay
29:55 - gameplay especially within the first 5
29:57 - Seconds you just straight to gameplay no
30:00 - in a world of the Zs with the seven keys
30:03 - of M2 none of that text business get rid
30:05 - of that stuff also your logo get rid of
30:08 - that stuff nobody cares about the logo
30:09 - BL so right to gameplay put it up front
30:13 - that's my that's my big argument yeah
30:14 - that sounds good and the developer
30:16 - answered on chat so apparently their
30:17 - goal is to do 15sec cinematic and then
30:19 - cut to gameplay which I guess maybe that
30:21 - could be could be no you don't think
30:24 - that's even that good oh swap G oh okay
30:27 - interesting swap it and then slice that
30:29 - 15 seconds into five seconds gamep play
30:32 - five seconds gameplay 5 Seconds G five
30:34 - seconds that could be one way but really
30:37 - people don't people don't like
30:39 - cinematics they really don't okay yeah I
30:43 - gotta say I mean I'm very much the same
30:44 - way every time I go on a scam page and I
30:46 - see cinematics I get really annoyed like
30:48 - skip skip skip trying to find some
30:50 - gameplay so yeah I guess I'm happy to
30:52 - see that I'm not Alan in
30:54 - that uh no I and part of the reason is I
30:58 - studied Shoppers on Steam like I just
31:00 - followed regular ass Gamers on Steam and
31:03 - I was like Hey show me how you shop on
31:04 - Steam and they did that they were like
31:06 - Skip Skip Skip Skip and they skipped
31:08 - through the cinematic trailers that I
31:10 - could tell were so expensive so you're
31:11 - spending thousands of dollars
31:13 - potentially depending if you're doing it
31:14 - yourself or hiring somebody in time
31:16 - you're spending all this time and money
31:18 - on something people are just like ah get
31:19 - out of here get get get so I don't know
31:22 - if you want to do it you can but people
31:24 - are just going to skip over that stuff
31:26 - yeah and uh here's here's a really
31:28 - interesting question from Jason story
31:30 - which actually uh yeah he says how back
31:32 - in the day the advice was them was were
31:33 - bad they killed sales and for me I
31:35 - definitely do uh remember that like I
31:36 - remember back when I like when I started
31:38 - doing uh trying to make games and
31:40 - learning about marketing back in like
31:42 - 2012 2013 back then the advice was
31:44 - indeed demos are bad because there's
31:45 - basically no upset like people play the
31:47 - game and either they get satisfied and
31:49 - they don't play the game or they get
31:50 - unsatisfied and they don't buy it anyway
31:51 - so either way it was always negatives
31:53 - but ever since steam started doing next
31:55 - Fest all of a sudden demos became really
31:56 - popular really useful so yeah do you
32:00 - know when that happened and why that
32:02 - happened was it just steam or was the
32:04 - combination of steam and the influencers
32:06 - doing all kinds of things and bringing
32:07 - more visibility because I'm pretty sure
32:09 - like you said uh demos are extremely
32:11 - important nowadays right it is and
32:14 - here's the main reason um there's two
32:17 - reasons the steam algorithm and
32:19 - streamers um and the fact that we are
32:22 - small Indies before that demo debate
32:24 - that was about AAA games with all the
32:26 - money in the world all the marketing
32:27 - budget everything in the world we are
32:29 - are that so I guess that's a third thing
32:31 - the rise of Indies we we are playing a
32:33 - different game than Triple A and again
32:35 - this is the cinematic trailer debate
32:37 - because a lot of people see Triple A
32:38 - does cinematic trailers that means I got
32:40 - to do a cinematic trailer don't follow
32:42 - the Triple A whatever Triple A is doing
32:44 - I kind of like oh should we do that they
32:46 - are playing a completely different game
32:48 - than we are okay we are playing a game
32:50 - we are unknown 100% unknown we have no
32:53 - money we have no attention we have
32:55 - nothing so we have to play a different
32:56 - game in one of the ways we do that is
32:58 - with these demos and what a demo does is
33:01 - it opens your game up to be played by
33:03 - streamers because um in in in in general
33:07 - this is pre- I'm talking pre-launch so
33:10 - your game is not available for sale
33:12 - you're just trying to get attention nice
33:13 - and early okay so at that point
33:17 - streamers can't play screenshots they
33:19 - just don't I mean there's sometimes on
33:22 - Tik Tok there's streamers who will watch
33:23 - a trailer and kind of do some commentary
33:25 - on it a little bit but for the most part
33:27 - a a influencer a streamer a YouTuber
33:30 - whoever needs a game to play and so
33:33 - there's this clever hack where you can
33:35 - give a demo early and then the streamer
33:38 - will play it and they that's something
33:41 - for them to do way before your launch of
33:43 - your game goes on sale so it's like you
33:44 - can get streamer coverage way early
33:47 - that's the hack that we Indies can do
33:49 - now the other thing that's awesome about
33:51 - this is see the YouTube or the stream uh
33:53 - the steam algorithm goes off attention
33:56 - so if you bring a ton of attention to
33:58 - your game in a short period of time the
34:01 - steam algorithm wakes up and it starts
34:03 - doing stuff like putting you in the
34:05 - discovery que putting you in more like
34:07 - this which is this widget at the bottom
34:09 - they start peppering your game in other
34:11 - widgets in the algorithm because of all
34:14 - that wish list attention that was driven
34:15 - to your page and so you know you get
34:18 - this these just what Hugo was saying
34:20 - like well if they play my demo and they
34:22 - don't like it will they buy it will they
34:24 - not will they hate it all that stuff it
34:25 - doesn't matter because it doesn't matter
34:28 - the people who play the demo and
34:30 - wishlist it all that is triggering the
34:33 - algorithm so people will start seeing
34:35 - your game on Steam and they've never
34:37 - watched that streamer play it they've
34:38 - never played the demo all of a sudden
34:40 - it's just like hey this game keeps
34:41 - popping up on my stream this on my
34:43 - screen this must be good it is that
34:45 - second order it is the um the fact that
34:48 - the steam algorithm says oh this is good
34:50 - and they boost it further than even a
34:52 - streamer can get it that is the reason
34:54 - we do the demo because the streamer
34:56 - plays it and then the steam algorithm
34:58 - takes over and that is the specific
35:01 - thing that's different and it's not just
35:03 - a theory I only got to this because
35:05 - we've watch Real Results so this is a
35:07 - game called doe keeper and they did a
35:09 - very traditional Twitter and Reddit
35:11 - Twitter and Reddit Twitter and Reddit
35:13 - and did nothing and then they released
35:15 - the demo and streamers found it and they
35:17 - thought it was awesome and then the
35:18 - steam algorithm took over and you could
35:20 - see the moment they launched the demo
35:21 - it's right here I don't even need to
35:22 - point at it I'm like when do you think
35:23 - they launched the demo it's right here
35:25 - you can just see the inflection point
35:27 - and the Reon is streamers loved that
35:29 - game so much um they got four this is
35:33 - one month after they launched their demo
35:35 - 40,000 wish lists from various spikes
35:39 - from streamers each one of these spikes
35:40 - is a streamer so that's why I think
35:42 - demos are so important is because it
35:44 - allow it unlocks streamers and festivals
35:47 - which are the two biggest boosts to
35:50 - cover to getting your game scen so
35:52 - that's why very related to that is a
35:54 - great topic that I don't think we
35:56 - covered on the original video which is
35:57 - is how like a lot of people talk about
36:00 - about wishless like wishless in total
36:02 - but you've mentioned several times
36:03 - wishless velocity so can you explain
36:05 - exactly why that is because it seems to
36:06 - be extremely powerful with regards to
36:08 - the CM
36:09 - algorithm yeah yeah so there's not
36:13 - there's no like metric of like oh
36:15 - wishless velocity um in general here's
36:18 - the thing forget about wishless forget
36:20 - about everything people need to be
36:22 - excited about your game that's the big
36:24 - thing like if I show this game and say
36:27 - Here's this cool game uh here's a game
36:28 - do you like it if your game is exciting
36:31 - and interesting people like yes that
36:32 - sounds so good I want to buy it and then
36:35 - if people like hey look at this game and
36:37 - people like oh yeah yeah that looks kind
36:40 - of similar yeah I think I played do you
36:42 - want to play it nah no I'm okay I got
36:44 - this other game to play that difference
36:45 - there is just excitement like how
36:47 - excited are people for a game and
36:50 - there's no like metric for like
36:51 - excitement um but what I found in enough
36:55 - data is games that sell well
36:58 - have a ton of wish lists and they
37:02 - convert very well so they have hundreds
37:04 - of thousands of wish lists and they
37:06 - convert those wish lists at a higher
37:08 - percentage games that don't sell well
37:10 - typically never got many wish lists and
37:13 - the conversion rate of those wish lists
37:14 - is even lower so you see how it's like
37:17 - you're four times because it's on two
37:19 - different metrics the the the better
37:21 - selling games work better and the
37:23 - difference is excitement so when people
37:25 - see that game they go that sounds so
37:26 - exciting I want to wish l at and when it
37:28 - goes on sale I want to buy it that's
37:29 - excitement okay they're really excited
37:31 - about that stuff and so when we talk
37:33 - about wish list velocity we can see it
37:35 - all the time like I have in my Discord
37:37 - we have a channel where people
37:38 - participate in a festival and two games
37:41 - are in the same festival and get about
37:43 - the same exposure like they're located
37:44 - in the same widget they'll have
37:46 - different wish list rates in other words
37:48 - we'll say like hey at the end of the
37:49 - festival I got a thousand wish list and
37:50 - then other gamees like at the end of the
37:51 - festival I got 10,000 wish lists you can
37:53 - just tell some games are just more
37:55 - interesting to people I don't know why
37:57 - some games are more interesting they
37:59 - just are and that's what I mean by
38:00 - wishless velocity so you could come to
38:04 - me and say Chris I have 100,000 wish
38:05 - lists and I'm like how long's your steam
38:07 - page been around and you're like oh yeah
38:09 - I've been marketing this game for 10
38:10 - years I have 100,000 wish lists and so
38:13 - you do the quick math you're like okay
38:15 - 100,000 wish list over 10 years that
38:16 - means 10,000 per year you're like well
38:19 - that's that's pretty good but if you're
38:21 - like Chris I have 100,000 wishes I was
38:23 - like since when you're like well I
38:24 - launched my steam page last week I'm
38:25 - like that's amazing you got 100,000 wish
38:28 - lists in one week I've never seen that
38:30 - before that's amazing that must mean
38:32 - your game is so exciting that people are
38:34 - like telling their friends the Press is
38:37 - covering it YouTube is covering it every
38:39 - YouTuber is talking about that's what I
38:40 - mean by excitement it is so exciting
38:43 - that people are are just wishlisting it
38:45 - and sharing it and it's going viral rdit
38:48 - made it to the front page readd it
38:49 - because everybody's like whoa that's
38:50 - amazing up vote it's just like it's just
38:53 - this excitement and so there's no wish
38:55 - list philos like what's a good wish list
38:56 - philosophy that's not it exactly I mean
38:59 - I Do cover that in in the on the
39:01 - dashboard on that um benchmarks but in
39:04 - general it's just like some games are
39:06 - just exciting to be and some aren't and
39:08 - you can kind of correlate that to this
39:11 - velocity and so there's no specific
39:13 - algorithm on Steam that says what's the
39:16 - wish list velocity there's none of that
39:18 - but it's just in general we can just
39:20 - kind of see it we can sense that we can
39:22 - feel it when a game is doing hot and
39:24 - that means everything's going to go
39:26 - better at sales so it's just the raw
39:28 - number it's also how long it took you to
39:31 - get to that wish list number because
39:33 - you'll see a lot of you'll see some blog
39:35 - posts on on Reddit and they're like I
39:37 - got 70,000 wish list and I sold no
39:39 - copies and then if you dig deeper into
39:42 - the comments you'll typically say yeah I
39:44 - got 7,000 wish I launched with 70,000
39:46 - wish list but I've been marketing my
39:47 - game for 10 years and then I'm like ah
39:49 - see that you can do the math and you're
39:51 - like well that velocity isn't that very
39:52 - good so that means there isn't much
39:54 - interest in the game which typically
39:55 - means the conversion rate is lower so
39:58 - that's that's typically what I see okay
40:01 - so I got to say that that is really
40:02 - awesome I really love the the uh the
40:05 - parallel of how essentially wish list
40:07 - velocity relates to excitement I got to
40:09 - say I I don't think I've heard that
40:11 - before but that makes a lot of sense I
40:12 - mean yeah the more excited people are
40:14 - the more faster they're going to go wish
40:16 - list and play the game so yeah that that
40:17 - was a really great Point yeah
40:19 - thanks good good yeah excitement is just
40:22 - like in general there's so much stuff
40:23 - out there your game has to be exciting
40:25 - to people yeah and it's hard it's hard
40:27 - to do this and I can't tell you like if
40:29 - somebody comes to me and says is my game
40:31 - exciting I don't know you just have to
40:32 - kind of put it out there and see who
40:34 - knows why some people like One Thing
40:36 - versus the other who knows nobody knows
40:39 - yeah and actually I guess a related
40:41 - question uh so here is someone uh asking
40:45 - G computer asking does Chris offer paid
40:48 - Consulting by chance so resource are
40:50 - extremely uh useful but for a very Niche
40:52 - very unique game could be beneficial to
40:53 - get some advice specifically for a game
40:55 - so cuz I mean uh the advice you mention
40:57 - in your blog obviously it's not really
40:59 - awesome but naturally it's very general
41:01 - broad advice so then it's up to
41:02 - developer to uh to apply that so do you
41:06 - have that kind of service where someone
41:07 - can just get really tailored one-on-one
41:10 - advice I don't I don't do one-on-one
41:13 - advice just because I don't know I just
41:15 - don't have enough time in the day yeah
41:18 - but again everything I know everything I
41:21 - know I put into these courses this
41:22 - course if you can't if you can't get the
41:24 - one-onone advice really every answer I
41:26 - ever know put in this these and I update
41:28 - them all the time every these updated
41:31 - and when you buy the course it gets
41:33 - updated automatic like in other words
41:34 - like I don't say oh version three is out
41:36 - everybody's got to buy version three
41:37 - nope it's a lifetime thing so everything
41:40 - I know I literally put into this course
41:42 - so I know it's it's that but I I really
41:46 - I don't uh I don't do uh in-person uh
41:49 - one-on-one Consulting I'm sorry but um
41:52 - but a couple options for
41:54 - you exactly uh again uh the course has
41:58 - it and then my Discord is really good
41:59 - how tomarket agame.com
42:01 - Discord um we have a I need help or
42:04 - advice uh I've got a feedback channel so
42:07 - those are other ways that aren't
42:09 - one-on-one advice that you can get that
42:11 - feedback um so yeah sorry
42:34 - yep so the way the data works is just
42:35 - join my mail end list howar game.com
42:38 - free like honestly that's every that is
42:40 - the center of the wheel if you want to
42:42 - know everything then I'm G to be doing
42:44 - how to Market a game.com free that that
42:46 - that is it you get a free book but
42:48 - anytime I'm like hey I'm doing something
42:50 - like when I did the survey for steam
42:51 - nextfest I just sent out the
42:54 - survey and I uh by the way sorry said
42:57 - apparently I was muted so apparently you
42:59 - could hear me but yeah I forgot to
43:00 - unmute CU my dog was walking around so
43:02 - he makes a lot of noise on the thing so
43:04 - I muted and uh so yeah basically my
43:06 - question was someone asking about uh how
43:07 - to share thata with Chris and because
43:09 - Chris does a lot of analysis like yes
43:12 - for data then analyze how everything
43:13 - works so that was that was a question go
43:15 - ahead Chris sorry yeah sorry um so yes
43:19 - so the um um so the way is how tomarket
43:22 - game.com sfree that's my mailing list
43:25 - that is the center of the wheel that is
43:27 - every everything that you want to know
43:29 - that I'm doing how tomarket game.com
43:31 - free I always share it on the newsletter
43:33 - first everything else H I might do it
43:35 - Discord maybe but the center of the
43:37 - wield is the the the newsletter how
43:39 - Market game.com free so what I do is
43:41 - every week send out a blog post and if
43:42 - I'm doing something where I'm like hey
43:44 - I'm trying to study this I will post it
43:47 - on my newsletter and say hey if you've
43:49 - got a game in nextfest fill out the
43:51 - survey and then there's a link to a
43:53 - survey and people fill it out that's how
43:54 - you share your data and I am militant
43:56 - about not sharing something that I
43:58 - shouldn't be um so I make it very
44:01 - explicit like hey I'm going to be
44:03 - sharing this in aggregate so I'll say
44:05 - like hey send me your data the most
44:07 - you're going to be shown is um in a
44:09 - graph so like uh I've just done one just
44:12 - recently um a new blog post here this
44:15 - one here where I did the survey for
44:17 - Steam nextfest and so the way I do the
44:19 - data is no I I just aggregate so these
44:22 - are all the people who responded to the
44:24 - survey you'll notice that I don't call
44:27 - out the games I just you become a bar if
44:29 - you submit your data to me you become a
44:31 - bar in this chart and so it's never
44:33 - pointed out now sometimes a game may
44:36 - have been like I might pull out the bar
44:37 - that had the biggest and be like what
44:39 - happened with that game and so I will
44:40 - message the the developer if I if I
44:42 - decide to like use this as a case study
44:44 - like oh why did this one game get so
44:47 - much higher than everybody else I will
44:48 - message the developer who sent me that
44:50 - thing and said hey um I saw you have the
44:52 - highest this why what happened and can I
44:55 - mention you explicit and your game and
44:57 - share your data I always ask permission
45:00 - before I personally call out a game just
45:02 - to make sure it's okay um and I'm
45:05 - militant about that so if if you don't
45:07 - want the data shared do you don't share
45:09 - you you can say hey Chris don't share my
45:11 - game um just share the numbers in
45:14 - aggregate this is the aggregate charts
45:16 - so yeah I I respect people's data and I
45:19 - would I would never want to just expose
45:21 - somebody who didn't want to
45:22 - be okay so here's a bit of a simpler
45:25 - question so how much of a priority is
45:27 - localization to Steam games like uh for
45:29 - me as far as I know it is extremely
45:31 - important and depending on your game it
45:33 - might actually be relatively uh easy
45:35 - especially Unity has a localization
45:37 - package which I used in my last game and
45:39 - was actually surprisingly easy to use so
45:41 - for me especially because my game wasn't
45:43 - very uh word heavy so it didn't have a
45:46 - ton of taxt so for me it was definitely
45:48 - a worthwhile thing so yeah can you say
45:50 - about how much does localization impact
45:52 - on Steam yeah it's actually quite a bit
45:55 - um so a lot of the big widgets like
45:58 - popular upcoming new and trending those
46:00 - widgets that give you that visibility
46:02 - boost right at the end those are
46:05 - localized so the popular upcoming of
46:08 - Germany would look different than the
46:10 - popular upcoming of Japan and they only
46:13 - steam will only put you valve the steam
46:15 - algorithm will only put you in those
46:17 - charts for your game if it's localized
46:20 - so um it is huge and uh stuff like China
46:24 - is now there are more Chinese users than
46:27 - there are us users so if you're not
46:31 - localized to Chinese you are missing out
46:33 - on half the audience the half the wish
46:35 - list so if you're like God I'm only at
46:36 - 50,000 wish lists and you're only in
46:38 - English you could potentially double
46:40 - your wish list if you are localized so
46:44 - um it is huge because some algorithms
46:46 - some wishlist algorithm some algorithms
46:48 - on Steam are just aggregate wish list it
46:50 - doesn't matter the country so if you
46:52 - could double your wish list by adding
46:54 - another country it is huge so I really
46:57 - really recommend people localize their
46:59 - game both the steam page and the the
47:02 - game itself and you specify that and you
47:05 - can translate the steam page even if
47:06 - your game is not translated and that
47:08 - helps too because there's a lot of users
47:10 - who can filter you can specify when
47:12 - you're creating your uh Steam account
47:14 - these are the languages that I want to
47:16 - see because a lot of people English is a
47:18 - second language and they can read it
47:19 - they might not be fluent in it but they
47:21 - can at least accept it they might
47:24 - struggle through it and so they might
47:25 - opt in but a lot of people don't so they
47:27 - will never see your game if you're not
47:28 - localized so definitely I highly highly
47:31 - recommend localizing it and typically
47:34 - it's better uh I know some developers
47:37 - who are like oh I'm I'm making my game
47:40 - less wordy for the very specific reason
47:42 - that it's cheaper to localize they're
47:44 - like oh I've been too wordy I've been
47:45 - talking about the seven keys of am tler
47:47 - too much I I did a deep lore dive on
47:49 - that I'm just stripping that stuff out
47:51 - so that I don't have to localize all
47:53 - that stuff and that's smart less words
47:56 - so you don't have to spend as much
47:57 - translating yeah okay great uh so here's
48:01 - another interesting question which is
48:02 - talking about in your opinion is there a
48:04 - better time of the year for release
48:06 - which I think I think the answer to that
48:07 - is doesn't matter too much but I think
48:09 - the second question makes a lot of sense
48:11 - which is like uh timing in terms of
48:13 - joining the uh next Fest how long after
48:16 - that should you launch like doesn't make
48:18 - sense to like uh join the next Fest and
48:21 - then uh launch your game a week after a
48:23 - month after two months after when should
48:25 - you terms of timing think about
48:28 - combining both nextfest in order to get
48:29 - the maximum amount of wish list and then
48:31 - combining that with the release
48:33 - timing great question um so
48:37 - um couple questions there um the first
48:40 - one about releasing for the most part I
48:44 - so in general my thought is Indies spend
48:47 - so little time thinking about the genre
48:49 - they pick and so much time picking the
48:51 - the specific release day and hour I
48:54 - think that's wrong it should be the
48:55 - other way you should spend so much time
48:57 - thinking about what genre What type of
48:59 - game what Graphics all that stuff you
49:01 - spend so much time on that and then
49:03 - quickly spend like half a day figuring
49:06 - out your day that you're gonna release
49:08 - just just a side note I just always find
49:10 - that so funny I get that question all
49:11 - the time like what day which hour which
49:14 - which day of the week challenge it
49:15 - doesn't matter as much as most Indies
49:17 - spend time thinking about it instead
49:19 - take that brain space that you're
49:20 - spending on that apply that to deciding
49:22 - which genre of game you're going to
49:24 - spend that's just a side note um but
49:27 - um most of the time it doesn't matter
49:29 - like time of
49:30 - year um except like November December
49:34 - because you know how I say oh don't
49:36 - launch it doesn't matter if you launch
49:37 - next to a AAA but in November December
49:40 - every AAA is launching at that time and
49:43 - so um if everyone it's mainly that you
49:46 - just want to be one of the there's like
49:48 - 10 slots every day to to get some
49:51 - visibility and if all 10 slots are
49:54 - filled with AAA games then that's not
49:57 - great so in general not November
50:00 - December all the other months are fine
50:02 - it doesn't matter um Simon caros the
50:04 - other guy game discover Co he can look
50:06 - at the hype he he studies hype he looks
50:09 - at several factors of how big is this
50:11 - game that's launching and he did
50:12 - analysis of when things matter and he
50:15 - found that the October November December
50:17 - this red means this is a very bad time
50:19 - to launch a game because like I said all
50:21 - the AAA games launch at that time all of
50:24 - them all the other months it's it does
50:26 - doesn't matter it's like a rounding
50:27 - error so in general these are the months
50:30 - to launch now your next question was
50:32 - What About Steam nextfest and I launch
50:34 - during right after a week after a day
50:36 - after the day of I don't know explicitly
50:40 - I'm going to be actually doing that
50:41 - analysis um after this nextfest just
50:44 - happened because a lot of games are
50:45 - launching during this time period you
50:47 - know in the next two weeks because
50:48 - they're they're doing this but the only
50:50 - reason the most important thing is you
50:52 - just don't want to launch next to a
50:54 - bunch of games it doesn't matter how big
50:56 - the game is it matters how many of those
50:58 - games and every Indie has been asking me
51:00 - this oh I'm going to launch right after
51:02 - nextfest because I'll have all this hype
51:03 - and then I'll be launching into hype
51:05 - I'll do this since everybody's asking me
51:07 - that that makes me think every Indie has
51:08 - the same idea which means you're neg
51:11 - you're all bumping into each other and
51:13 - all these Indies have this clever plan
51:15 - to launch right after nextfest which
51:17 - makes me think you're now blind you're
51:19 - now stuffing each other and you're all
51:21 - running into each other and again
51:23 - remember it's not the size of the game
51:25 - it's how many games are launching so
51:26 - that makes me think it's actually not
51:28 - good to launch after nextfest but I'm
51:30 - going to do some deeper analysis that's
51:32 - my gut feel but I don't have data behind
51:34 - it and I'm gonna look uh I'm gonna I
51:36 - have a couple ideas of how I might look
51:38 - at it in the next couple weeks after
51:40 - next test is over so yeah I have to
51:42 - that's a really interesting point which
51:43 - is how when something is a great
51:45 - opportunity as soon as a ton of Indies
51:47 - learn about that opportunity kind of
51:48 - becomes over cry so kind of becomes a
51:50 - negative as opposed to a positive so
51:52 - yeah that's a really interesting
51:55 - analysis yeah
51:57 - okay so here's another really
51:59 - interesting question like in the
52:00 - developers are usually tied for budget
52:02 - so let's say if you had an extra 500
52:04 - bucks to spend on your game like should
52:07 - you use it to upgrade like the graphics
52:08 - or the art style or does paying
52:11 - streamers and YouTubers does that make
52:13 - sense and I guess just in general just
52:14 - talking about like paid advertising paid
52:17 - coverage is that something that you've
52:18 - seen have a positive effect or not
52:21 - really yeah well uh I mean if you got
52:24 - extra 500 bucks we run the sale right
52:26 - now you can get get all the courses for
52:27 - just a little over 500 bucks so no I
52:30 - mean I'm joking a little bit but you
52:34 - know the courses really help you not
52:36 - make stupid mistakes because I see a lot
52:38 - of Indies they they go to Early Access
52:40 - when they shouldn't they think that they
52:42 - should move their release date because
52:43 - of AAA games launching that's not that's
52:45 - stupid don't do that stick to your plans
52:47 - there's all these things that you can do
52:49 - wrong that are irreversible big mistakes
52:52 - that you can make and that's why I put
52:53 - the course together is because it's up
52:54 - there now besides that okay now you want
52:56 - to do this here's what I think in order
52:59 - are the most important things to spend
53:00 - money on let's say you have a couple
53:02 - hundred bucks okay one is don't make
53:05 - your own capsule just don't um don't
53:08 - take a screenshot don't make your text
53:10 - and Ms paint and then slap together a
53:13 - capsule hire a professional illustrator
53:16 - to make one for you they range depending
53:19 - on if you're chancing it on fiver they
53:20 - range between like a hundred bucks up to
53:23 - like 500 and then if you go super
53:25 - expensive they can be like thousand or
53:27 - more um but in general you can get a
53:29 - pretty good capsule done for 500s and
53:33 - get the text done to I see a lot of
53:35 - Indies they have beautiful Illustrated
53:37 - capsules and then they they make the
53:40 - text and sometimes that text looks so
53:42 - bad it's like it ruins the thing that
53:44 - they paid money for behind it so get
53:46 - hire somebody to make both the the logo
53:48 - for your game and the picture in the
53:51 - background okay now the next thing you
53:54 - should do is festivals um are the number
53:57 - one way to get wish list and I track
53:59 - those on how tomarket agame.com
54:01 - festivals and a lot of those have entry
54:03 - fees they're like a hundred bucks 200
54:06 - bucks at the most expensive and
54:08 - typically games get into about four or
54:11 - five festivals during the lifetime of
54:12 - their marketing depending on how long
54:14 - they're marketing the type of game four
54:16 - to five and so you might be spending
54:18 - like maybe 500
54:21 - 600,000 on just entry fees to get into
54:23 - these festivals and it is worth it
54:25 - because those get you thousands and
54:27 - thousands of wish lists and lots of
54:29 - visibility so those festivals are very
54:32 - good um the other thing that I would
54:34 - spend money on is um a trailer um a good
54:39 - trailer that is edited well and is
54:41 - exciting again those trailers can go
54:43 - somewhere like 500 to a th000 and then
54:45 - if you go super extreme very good
54:48 - they're like $10,000 but that's for like
54:51 - the top tier Indie Games spend $110,000
54:53 - to get a very professional trailer but
54:56 - you can hire somebody in Poland for
54:58 - like5 to ,000 that is worth it because
55:01 - again these are just making your game
55:03 - look expensive that's what you're trying
55:05 - to do um if your game now one of the
55:08 - things you I'm just talking marketing
55:10 - but game development you know if you're
55:12 - just
55:13 - using programmer art definitely get that
55:16 - stuff out get programmer out art out
55:19 - hire either a professional or buy asset
55:21 - packs and use them correctly that's very
55:23 - hard to describe but if your graphics
55:25 - are bad it's very very hard to get over
55:27 - that um and then um could should you
55:30 - spend it on PR you can hire a PR person
55:33 - maybe I don't know if that's as if
55:35 - you're limited for Budget I don't know
55:36 - if that's going to help you as much also
55:38 - paying streamers that's not going to
55:40 - help you as much you can do very well
55:42 - free organic streamers you just reach
55:43 - out to I would say 300 streamers and I'm
55:45 - not making that up 300 make a
55:47 - spreadsheet of um 300 streamers that are
55:51 - close to what your game is who've played
55:53 - those type of games reach out to 300 and
55:56 - that's your goal 300 you don't need to
55:58 - pay for streamers you just need to grind
55:59 - it out and contact all those streamers
56:02 - that in general is what I'd spend money
56:03 - on capsule trailer really good courses
56:07 - that won't screw you over and then maybe
56:10 - um uh paying a PR person but that's way
56:13 - down the list because that's they can
56:15 - get pretty expensive so those are kind
56:17 - of the things I'd spend money on yeah so
56:19 - a bunch of people are asking so
56:20 - essentially where do I hire professional
56:22 - artists and uh Jason story actually
56:24 - asked like like there is Derek Leu which
56:27 - is very famous for making excellent
56:29 - trailers like is there a related name to
56:31 - that and I guess I can perhaps answer
56:34 - from my own point of view on WE Tire a
56:35 - professional artist like for me I've
56:37 - used fiber you can find tons of people
56:39 - on there like for example when I made my
56:41 - uh kitchen chaos course I hired an
56:43 - artist from fivr to make this and when I
56:45 - made my game dinky Guardians I also
56:47 - hired an artist to make the the capsule
56:49 - make the logo and so on so that's how I
56:52 - found it but Chris do you have any other
56:54 - sources for firing artists
56:56 - yeah one thing I do for both trailers
56:58 - and um capsules is just look through
57:00 - games that are similar to
57:03 - yours you know you filter them by tag
57:05 - and stuff find games that are similar to
57:06 - yours similar you know scale Graphics
57:09 - all that kind of stuff and just find
57:11 - those people on Twitter and message that
57:12 - the developer and say hey I love your
57:14 - capsule I'm making a game kind of
57:15 - similar to yours who was your capsule
57:17 - artist how much did you pay for it how'd
57:18 - you do it just talk to people and it's
57:20 - it's all word of mouth and then people
57:22 - are like oh yeah this who I is over
57:24 - there um we do keep track of um some
57:29 - good capsule artists on my Discord so
57:30 - how tomarket agame.com
57:31 - [Music]
57:33 - Discord there's a jobs Channel and if
57:36 - you look at the pinned message on jobs
57:38 - there's a spreadsheet where people keep
57:40 - track of all those capsule artists so
57:42 - that's another option we we' know that
57:44 - these are good capsule Arts they're not
57:45 - scammers or anything um but in general
57:48 - that's how I do it just just ask just
57:50 - friendly hey who did your capsule who
57:51 - did your trailer I love your trailer
57:53 - it's great oh you did it are you looking
57:55 - for extra work I'll pay you for you to
57:57 - make my trailer that kind of thing
57:58 - that's what you do yeah I gotta say
58:00 - that's a very very straightforward
58:02 - approach find people who have the sort
58:04 - of art sound that you want and literally
58:06 - just ask them just send them a message
58:08 - and yeah they might be able to give you
58:09 - a really excellent recommendation yeah
58:11 - that's people are nice people are nice I
58:13 - so many people are like is there an app
58:15 - or a website that tracks the best no
58:17 - just ask people you can just be friends
58:18 - with people you just talk to them the
58:20 - best thing just ask just ask okay so
58:24 - here's an interesting uh question which
58:27 - is uh do Indie co-op games have a higher
58:29 - chance of success than solo games on the
58:31 - same market so like is it like single
58:35 - player and multiplayer I tend to find
58:37 - that multiplayer games do break out
58:39 - quite a lot like whenever there's one it
58:40 - usually becomes a huge hit but you
58:42 - probably don't really see all the other
58:44 - ones that are multiplayer and complet
58:45 - flop like for example local multiplayer
58:47 - as far as I know that one is really not
58:49 - a good genre to tackle cuz local
58:50 - multiplayer is really difficult but even
58:52 - online multiplayer I don't actually know
58:53 - what are the uh statistics like does is
58:56 - it actually a net positive trying to go
58:58 - for multiplayer versus single player or
59:00 - no I don't know I haven't done this
59:03 - analysis this is a very good question
59:05 - and I should this is a blog post in the
59:06 - making I could do this this is easy to
59:08 - do I could do it stay tuned I will do
59:10 - this at some point but here's my gut
59:12 - feel again this is gut Chris's gut okay
59:16 - um for certain genres I think it is very
59:19 - good for example open world
59:20 - Survivalcraft that is like the best
59:23 - genre right now open world Survivalcraft
59:24 - is the number one genre on
59:26 - just median Revenue the type of games
59:28 - that go viral have that velocity and
59:30 - those games are very popular as Co-op
59:33 - because people bring all their friends
59:34 - they all hang out they're like hey I'm
59:36 - building the base why don't you go out
59:37 - and get some resources you know it's a
59:38 - very collaborative Cooperative style
59:41 - genre so those type of games really good
59:44 - all these games where you're kind of
59:45 - hanging out with friends because that is
59:47 - the main way people play on games uh
59:49 - play games on Steam is cooperative it's
59:51 - a it's a way to hang out with friends
59:52 - virtually and I mean I've talked to you
59:55 - know how I always do studies with users
59:57 - you know just random Gamers and I talked
59:59 - to him the guy says I filter out
60:00 - everything that is not a multiplayer
60:02 - game because for this one guy now this
60:04 - is just one data point he says
60:07 - multiplayer is how I play games that's
60:10 - what I do I I play Steam games for the
60:12 - social aspect with my friends because my
60:14 - friends live all around the country and
60:16 - this is how I hang out with them that's
60:18 - very smart so I think if you're making
60:20 - an open world Survivalcraft very
60:22 - important now other genres I don't
60:24 - really like that art Co-op are like
60:27 - party games these kind of like kind of
60:30 - um you know like uh some of them do very
60:33 - well like uh what is it called plate up
60:37 - or um overcooked those do well but I
60:40 - feel like those party game kind of Mario
60:42 - Party Co-op competitive games are very
60:45 - Hit or Miss they either do super well
60:47 - like played up and overcooked or they do
60:49 - or um uh like um Fall Guys those do very
60:53 - well and then everything else does
60:55 - terribly because Co-op style games just
60:57 - don't do like local multiplayer because
60:59 - most
61:00 - PCS don't have a couch in front of them
61:02 - they have like one chair so local co-op
61:04 - is very hard to do well on if it's like
61:06 - a party game so that's why I say there's
61:08 - no one answer depends on your genre so
61:10 - if your game is a crafty buildy
61:13 - simulation game yes those do well but if
61:15 - your game's like a competitive party
61:17 - game they don't now the other thing to
61:19 - watch out for is multiplayer firstperson
61:22 - Shooters those are again either super
61:25 - popular or nothing like there's there's
61:28 - very little there's like one or two FPS
61:31 - that do super well in Co-op and it's
61:33 - very very very very very very hard to do
61:36 - a multiplayer competitive first-person
61:38 - shooter that's not Co-op because that
61:41 - genre is if you don't get enough people
61:43 - in the servers even if somebody likes
61:45 - your game they're gonna be like when's
61:46 - the server going to fill up I'm waiting
61:47 - for the server to fill up and if you
61:49 - don't have enough players the game dies
61:51 - nobody wants to play this game and
61:53 - they'll give you bad reviews so
61:54 - multiplayer games are very hard where
61:56 - you have to fill a Lobby whereas Co-op
61:58 - is not as hard because it's like hey my
61:59 - four friends I don't have to wait for
62:00 - somebody to fill the server it's like I
62:02 - have four friends we're ready to go
62:03 - let's do this the other genre I forgot
62:06 - to mention that's very popular with
62:07 - Co-op is horror horror Co-op is very
62:09 - popular and I'd highly recommend it I
62:11 - think everybody should make a horror
62:12 - game and if you make a co-op horror game
62:14 - that's even better because then it's you
62:15 - and your friends telling ghost stories
62:17 - playing this spooky story you get a
62:18 - scream and cry together it's fun that's
62:21 - fun and so a lot of people do that so I
62:23 - guess my short answer is if you're
62:24 - making open world Survivalcraft or
62:25 - horror definitely anything else I'm like
62:28 - maybe don't I don't know it's really
62:30 - hard so that's that's in a nutshell what
62:32 - I think yeah great takeaway I mean there
62:35 - was another question which you pretty
62:36 - much answer which is basically what are
62:38 - the popular genres now in uh 2024 and
62:41 - yeah I guess the main takeaways
62:43 - definitely do not make a platformer and
62:45 - perhaps try doing a horror game because
62:46 - those usually do quite well and uh and
62:49 - on this question real quick though I'll
62:51 - answer this um and it's not just 2024 it
62:54 - is ever and this is one of the big
62:55 - things I try and tell Indies genres do
62:57 - not shift as fast as people assume um
63:00 - the top genres right now on Steam just
63:02 - top of my head are what I typically call
63:04 - crafty buildy simulation games it's a
63:06 - game where you're in a sandbox there's
63:08 - no real story a little bit of a story
63:10 - but you're just kind of like crafting
63:11 - things you're just building in this
63:13 - environment it's it's open-ended you can
63:15 - do whatever there's no narrative it's
63:17 - not linear it's just like here's all
63:18 - these parts build it it's like Legos
63:21 - everything that's like digital Legos
63:23 - does very well on Steam and these genres
63:25 - typically the top ones are like I said
63:27 - open world survival craft um city
63:30 - builders strategy games um Auto
63:34 - Battlers um uh let's see Rog likes in
63:38 - general and what I mean by Rog likes are
63:41 - um specifically the these kind of where
63:42 - there's like a very simple arcadey
63:44 - mechanic at the center but then around
63:47 - the ring as you play the game you get
63:49 - some soul point or something that you
63:51 - can spend on permanent upgrades but you
63:53 - die and you keep repeating but there's a
63:54 - metal layer that's very like um
63:57 - simulation games look up any game by
63:59 - play way these are games where it's like
64:00 - you've got a job where you are like
64:03 - managing a store and you've got to a
64:05 - supermarket and you've got to buy stuff
64:07 - for the shells and you got to put it
64:09 - away and all these kind of simulation
64:11 - games no story no nothing you're just
64:14 - building this stuff now the reason I say
64:17 - in 2024 doesn't matter because these
64:19 - games have always been popular on PC
64:21 - like Sim City uh The Sims these kind of
64:25 - big crafty buildy simulation game
64:29 - civilization Forex is Big they've always
64:31 - been big so in general and here's a
64:33 - quick rule of thumb I always say is the
64:37 - safer genre to do is one where you do
64:39 - not control the main character okay in
64:42 - general um these are games where they're
64:44 - menu driven So like um if you're
64:47 - thinking about a city Builder what do
64:48 - you do you control a cursor and you move
64:50 - this cursor around and you move the
64:52 - cursor and you say put a building here
64:54 - put a road here you controlling a cursor
64:57 - not a player now there's some there's a
64:59 - lot of caveats around that but in
65:01 - general my thought is it's safer to be a
65:03 - cursor than it is to control the main
65:05 - character okay uh there's a lot of
65:07 - caveats and I know people let we'll talk
65:10 - about it but in general it's safer to
65:12 - control a menu cursor than it is to
65:14 - control a main character um couple
65:16 - caveats where this doesn't quite apply
65:17 - is horror games you control the main
65:19 - character and it's a very linear horror
65:21 - games are very linear and very um short
65:24 - they're like two hours so do well on
65:26 - Steam that's an exception because
65:27 - everybody loves to be scared that's why
65:29 - that works um in general that's that's
65:32 - generally what happens and then there's
65:33 - another one which is a um a narrative
65:36 - like um a visual novel Style game again
65:39 - you're not controlling main character
65:40 - you're controlling a menu where you
65:41 - select what your choices are of the main
65:43 - character but you're not like moving a
65:44 - person around the the screen um those do
65:47 - well and those are pretty linear
65:48 - narrative but you have to be a very good
65:49 - writer for those to work if you're not a
65:51 - good writer you've never written a novel
65:53 - before much less a v virtual novel
65:55 - you're probably not going to do well on
65:57 - those but those are in general are the
65:59 - genres that I think are good okay very
66:03 - good and I mean a lot of those games are
66:05 - actually games that are very systems
66:06 - having like city builders survival
66:08 - crafting games a lot of those are quite
66:10 - uh systems driven so here's a question
66:12 - which is what if you have a game that
66:14 - has like in-depth gameplay but not
66:16 - necessarily the finest art let's say
66:17 - just a programmer like just myself it's
66:20 - just a programmer building some really
66:21 - complex systems some interesting
66:22 - gameplay but without having the best of
66:24 - art how exact L can they do marketing
66:27 - considering how marketing is a visual
66:29 - medium so yeah do you have any tips for
66:31 - that okay yes this is a great point in
66:34 - general and this is my general theory on
66:37 - Steam there's two ways to do well in
66:38 - Steam okay you can either have the most
66:40 - beautiful Graphics very very beautiful
66:43 - graphics and so I think of it as a as a
66:45 - chart who's the most beautiful game the
66:47 - more beautiful you are the better you're
66:49 - going to do think of games like stray
66:51 - manner Lords we talked about that that's
66:52 - a game that's just beautiful it looks
66:54 - like a a photo like medieval times even
66:57 - though how would you get a photo of
66:57 - medieval times but either but it just is
67:00 - beautiful right or you go deep your
67:03 - game's the deepest game whatever the
67:06 - graphics could be awful but the game is
67:07 - like simulating everything and think
67:09 - about like Dwarf Fortress they've
67:12 - they've added an overlay that looks okay
67:14 - but it's not amazing but if you think of
67:16 - Rim World um Dwarf Fortress there's a
67:20 - game called NOA if you know about it it
67:22 - it looks okay but every single Pixel is
67:25 - simulated and so my point is if your
67:28 - graphics aren't great you have like
67:30 - programmer art you have to go straight
67:32 - deep another game to look at is Cosmo
67:34 - tier where you build a spaceship I'm not
67:36 - digging on the graphics they're
67:38 - serviceable but they're kind of
67:39 - programmer art Graphics but you it
67:42 - really simulates building a spaceship
67:44 - and so if you don't have the greatest
67:45 - Graphics you have to go deep deep deep
67:46 - deep deep you have to simulate
67:48 - everything you have to do these things
67:49 - where it's like every cat is simulated
67:51 - and every hair on the cat is simulated
67:53 - and every whisker and every Flea on the
67:55 - back of the hair of the cat is simulated
67:58 - you know you just go deep as possible
67:59 - systems driven those games can do okay
68:03 - they they do well I mean again Rim World
68:05 - Dwarf Fortress I'd even put Minecraft in
68:07 - there Cosmo tier Noel all these games
68:11 - that are not the most prettiest but
68:13 - they're the deepest and how you mark
68:14 - this is with a demo because you can't
68:17 - show a screenshot and say hey this
68:19 - game's deep you have to give it to them
68:22 - and say play it it's deep it's the
68:23 - deepest game you've ever played and
68:24 - demos do fantastic for these typ of
68:26 - games so try and get a demo out asly as
68:28 - possible think about Minecraft or coso
68:31 - tiero they just put the whole game out
68:33 - for free they just put the whole game
68:35 - out for free remember Minecraft the
68:36 - early one it's totally for free and then
68:38 - people get so hooked because the game is
68:40 - infinitely deep and they're just like
68:42 - wow this great and every update you do
68:43 - brings more people in because they tell
68:45 - their friendss like this game's so deep
68:47 - and you just do it through the demo
68:49 - that's how you do it so um I think
68:52 - that's that's it just every time you
68:53 - think you've gone deep enough go deeper
68:55 - add more more complexity more complexity
68:57 - it's a systems driven game that's what I
69:00 - recommend for people who aren't good at
69:01 - Art yeah that's a really great point so
69:03 - basically the weaker the art the
69:05 - stronger the uh the uh gameplay has to
69:07 - be and yeah Cosmo tier is really an
69:09 - excellent example because I believe this
69:10 - game was in the making for like eight
69:11 - years and for like half that time they
69:13 - did have a public demo they were
69:15 - constantly getting a ton of feedback so
69:17 - yeah if you don't have like the perfect
69:18 - gorgeous visuals then the gameplay
69:21 - really needs to be really solid really
69:22 - solid and really complex so it needs to
69:24 - have tons of inter logging systems
69:25 - and yeah there are some games I found
69:27 - quite a lot of success with uh by taking
69:29 - that strategy yeah another game that I
69:32 - forgot to mention in the genres that I
69:33 - think is really good especially for
69:35 - firsttime devs idle games idle games are
69:37 - very good they can be very deep systems
69:39 - driven you control them with a menu
69:42 - remember you like select what you want
69:43 - to upgrade um your graphics don't have
69:45 - to be as great um and they it's a good
69:48 - thing to learn systems driven design
69:51 - they can be endlessly replayable the
69:52 - play times are very long so I highly
69:54 - recommend if you're like I I don't know
69:56 - what type of game it makes first make a
69:57 - systems driven Idol game and some that I
70:00 - recommend are micro civilization chill
70:02 - aquarium which is one I just talked
70:04 - about um let's see Loi beats um I think
70:08 - it's called Spirit City Loi beats try
70:10 - that one these are games where they just
70:12 - kind of idle they sit in the background
70:13 - oh Rusty Retirement Systems driven games
70:17 - lots of upgrades lots of depth try them
70:20 - out yeah the idle genre is definitely
70:22 - definitely an interesting one honestly
70:23 - it's a it's a genre that I very much
70:25 - enjoy playing and definitely one on my
70:27 - to-do list of one day to play so yeah
70:29 - this is a because it is a genre that is
70:32 - not necessarily too complex but can be
70:35 - if you have some great design you can
70:36 - get basically a ton of uh a ton of game
70:39 - playay time which you were mentioning
70:41 - how in the very beginning on the
70:42 - benchmarks page on how demos uh really
70:45 - great demos have like uh like 38 minutes
70:48 - and 65 minutes and yeah I guess if you
70:50 - have an idle game it's a little bit
70:51 - easier to get to get that high which
70:54 - then helps boost up the algorithm so
70:56 - yeah idlers are definitely a very great
70:58 - genre that people definitely should not
71:00 - ignore
71:02 - definitely okay so here's another really
71:05 - interesting question which is like is it
71:07 - smart to make your first team game make
71:09 - it free with the goal of basically
71:10 - building a community then the question
71:12 - asks is it fine to make it cost money
71:14 - and I think that either one is fine but
71:16 - what about the specific strategy of make
71:17 - it free not to make money but ready to
71:19 - build a community so is that a viable
71:22 - strategy I don't like that strategy um
71:25 - oh for the reason of okay a couple the
71:28 - steam algorithm again likes money so if
71:31 - you make money it promotes you further
71:34 - and one of the things you do um once
71:36 - you've launched you've launched in your
71:38 - first two weeks is um uh after the first
71:42 - month you can start discounting it and
71:43 - so every time you discount it everybody
71:45 - who wishlisted it gets a gets a
71:47 - notification and says hey the game that
71:48 - you wishlisted is on sale so you have
71:51 - control over the algorithm you can push
71:53 - a button and get visibility and that
71:54 - button is discount and then visibility
71:56 - comes in when your game's free you can't
71:59 - discount it so you don't have this every
72:01 - 30-day button that you can push to get
72:02 - more visibility the other thing is it's
72:05 - good to get feedback when it's paid when
72:08 - it's paid people have your money so they
72:11 - have more of an opinion like if it's
72:13 - free people who don't like your game are
72:15 - like it's free who cares and they throw
72:17 - it over their shoulder and they get out
72:18 - of there when they have you when you
72:21 - took their money they're like you took
72:23 - my money I wanted a real game this is
72:25 - not a real game it's not a real game
72:26 - because B and they'll have feedback for
72:29 - you about why they don't like your game
72:31 - which is hard it hurts but it's helpful
72:35 - I find steam reviewers are they're kind
72:37 - of jerks but they also write a lot of
72:41 - the time you know and you can say like
72:43 - well the person's a jerk but they're
72:45 - kind of right uh and it's hard to hear
72:47 - this and it and you have to build up
72:48 - your leather shell your shell of
72:50 - leathery skin uh just like old tough
72:53 - leathery skin it it's good skill build
72:55 - up and so I find a lot of people want to
72:57 - make it free because then they're like
72:58 - well then they won't be so mean to me
73:00 - then you got to toughen up and you got
73:02 - to do it come on let's toughen up get
73:04 - that leather skin it's gonna suck but
73:06 - you're going to get better at it you're
73:07 - going to get the good feedback you're
73:09 - going to make your next game better and
73:11 - um who knows your game could turn out to
73:14 - be a viral hit like a vampire survivors
73:18 - and if it's free that Viral hit doesn't
73:20 - do you anything or it could change your
73:22 - life so you never know that's why I say
73:24 - you should always always ask for money
73:27 - get paid for your time let's do this get
73:29 - your skin tough let's do it yeah that is
73:32 - definitely a very good point both on uh
73:34 - being able to withstand reviews which
73:36 - definitely if the game is paid you're
73:38 - definitely going to get quite a lot and
73:39 - that is definitely a very very useful
73:40 - skill to have I mean for me luckily I
73:42 - started by making for me I started by
73:45 - making Flash games and yeah back then
73:47 - even though the games were free the
73:48 - audience was definitely very uh let's
73:50 - say strict they definitely knew what
73:52 - they wanted and thanks to reading those
73:54 - reviews definitely built up that muscle
73:56 - so when I finally made a steam game I
73:57 - was definitely much more ready to
73:59 - receiving some reviews and a lot of them
74:01 - are actually very uh I was going to say
74:04 - positive but I mean even the negative
74:05 - reviews they are positive in the sense
74:06 - that they teach you something so as long
74:08 - as you don't take as long as you read it
74:11 - for what it is you can see it as
74:12 - feedback and then you can apply that in
74:13 - order to make your next game better so
74:15 - yeah I definitely do believe that being
74:17 - able to gain that muscle to become
74:19 - better at analyzing reviews and taking
74:22 - taking some learnings from it I think
74:24 - that is going to serve you very well on
74:25 - the long run yep yep T toughen up get
74:29 - that get charge money for your
74:32 - game okay and here's actually an
74:34 - interesting question so basically you're
74:35 - saying how making a free game is not a
74:37 - good way of building a community so
74:39 - somewhat related so what is the best way
74:42 - to uh gain a community like one approach
74:44 - is doing devlog specifically on YouTube
74:46 - that's one way that people do it and
74:48 - other people try to post tons of gifts
74:49 - on Twitter or Reddit then a bunch of
74:51 - people also find quite a bunch of
74:53 - success on Tik Tok like on Tik Tok you
74:54 - can get get like a thousand views or 10
74:56 - million there seems to be like no in
74:58 - between uh a bunch of people find
74:59 - Millions which then leads to hundreds of
75:01 - thousands wish list and just by itself
75:03 - that gains quite a lot of success so
75:05 - what is the rough platform that you've
75:07 - seen be most useful to indid
75:10 - devs yeah yeah
75:12 - so this course right here wish list
75:15 - invisibility master class this is all
75:16 - this course is about and when we say
75:18 - build a community that's that's the way
75:20 - people who think marketing is dirty say
75:22 - how do I get wish list how do I get how
75:24 - do I make money it's like that sounds
75:25 - crass to say that they're like oh I want
75:27 - to build a community no no no no no
75:29 - let's just let's just cut to the chase
75:30 - how do you get wish list how do you get
75:32 - the money so that we can do this
75:33 - full-time that's all this course is all
75:35 - about um um and we can go uh what this
75:39 - course is and here's the here's the
75:41 - thing is every single lecture tells you
75:45 - and I break it down by the time when to
75:47 - do it here here's the curriculum here I
75:50 - mean I organize it based on what stage
75:52 - you are in the game uh you know in
75:55 - making the game and I just go step by
75:57 - step this is not handwavy like try this
75:59 - this is very actionable steps there's
76:02 - like spreadsheets and stuff to figure
76:04 - this stuff out so the course is built
76:06 - around doing this so the reason I I do
76:09 - this is um it just helped like there's
76:12 - so much handwavy advice out there and I
76:15 - really built this course to help you
76:17 - with that question of like how do I
76:19 - literally get people to my steam page
76:21 - and I T you know like you mentioned Tik
76:23 - Tok I I I have a whole thing on Tik Tok
76:26 - you know see right here Tik Tok it's
76:28 - like right there um I go step byep every
76:30 - single technique how to do it and so in
76:33 - general here's the secret and I'll just
76:36 - tell it to you because we're friends um
76:39 - and uh Hugo's included in the friends
76:42 - circle because if you buy this you you
76:44 - Hugo gets some help too uh in general
76:47 - here's how it works there's two types of
76:48 - games pretty games and fun to play games
76:50 - okay if you are pretty if you're a
76:52 - pretty game you can go viral on
76:55 - to or on Reddit you just post a video
76:59 - and you go viral get thousands of wish
77:01 - lists from that but your game has to be
77:03 - so so so so pretty like you have to be a
77:05 - former graphic designer a former artist
77:07 - at like a AAA company 95% of games are
77:10 - not pretty they just aren't I mean
77:12 - they're goodlooking but they're not like
77:13 - so pretty that it goes viral okay uh
77:16 - Twitter also works uh the other thing
77:18 - that works that with those not just
77:19 - pretty but like cutesy games with
77:21 - creatures with big eyes and and floppy
77:23 - ears those games also do well
77:25 - if you're not one of those types of
77:26 - games okay the next things are here's
77:29 - how you get wish list is how you get
77:31 - visibility festivals applying to
77:33 - festivals remember I said how Market
77:34 - game.com festivals streamers and both of
77:37 - those require demo so what you do is if
77:39 - you're if you're not a pretty game you
77:42 - build a demo as fast as you can and you
77:43 - give it to streamers and you apply to
77:45 - festivals and that's how you do it and
77:47 - that's the technique and you just do
77:49 - that festivals and streamers festivals
77:50 - and streamers festivals and streamers
77:52 - until you want to die and then you
77:53 - release your game that's how it works
77:56 - that's how this works and this I know
77:57 - that was like really simple like how do
77:58 - I reach out to a streamer how do I do
77:59 - that I literally give you letters that
78:01 - you just fill out your Game's name and
78:04 - spreadsheets of how to track which
78:06 - streamer playing your game like I give
78:08 - you all the tools that you need to do to
78:10 - do this stuff it's not like oh just
78:11 - Contex streamers here's a chapter on no
78:13 - it's like okay do this then this then
78:15 - this so that's what this uh this whole
78:17 - course is I hope that answer your
78:20 - question okay yeah great so here's a bit
78:22 - of a simpler question and actually I
78:24 - would love to know the answer to this
78:25 - one so you've talked about a lot about
78:27 - how horror games is a great genre for
78:29 - indie game devs to make so simple
78:31 - question how long should a horror game
78:33 - be like is that something where I'm
78:35 - guessing it's not something where the
78:36 - audience expects like a 100 hours of
78:37 - gameplay so what do people generally
78:39 - prefer in that gen I mean for any of
78:42 - these answers just go go go play a bunch
78:45 - of um horror games you can just click on
78:47 - Steam on the horror tag look at the top
78:49 - sellers click the thing and then when
78:51 - you look at the reviews every review
78:53 - tells the hour how long the person
78:55 - played and a lot of reviewers say stuff
78:58 - like hey this game was two hours and it
79:00 - was great or some people say like it was
79:02 - 20 minutes and it was terrible so you
79:03 - just start tracking that stuff in
79:06 - general what I find is under two hours
79:07 - for a horror game which is why horror
79:08 - games are so awesome uh and there are
79:10 - some subg genres of horror games like
79:12 - Co-op horror games like lethal company
79:14 - where they have much longer medium play
79:16 - times because it's Co-op multiplayer
79:18 - game but for the most part most horror
79:20 - games are like two hours long um because
79:22 - people don't want to be scared for like
79:23 - 10 hours that sounds horrifying it's
79:26 - like people just want to be scared for
79:29 - like 30 minutes at a time so in general
79:31 - that's why I say two hours but again do
79:33 - your own research go go on the web on
79:35 - Steam and just look at a bunch of games
79:37 - and and keep a little spreadsheet and
79:38 - say this game Medan uh you know the time
79:40 - that people said that it took was two
79:42 - hours this game time play was 30 minutes
79:45 - you know and just kind of keep track of
79:46 - that stuff and then then you get a good
79:47 - judgment and then play the games this is
79:49 - this is the thing go play games I find
79:52 - that not enough people play games I I
79:54 - interviewed one of the top um in one of
79:56 - the things that was um in my blog the
79:59 - game was um Deep Rock Galactic survivors
80:02 - and that studio when they were planning
80:04 - to design their game they downloaded 30
80:08 - different vampire Survivor likes and
80:10 - they looked and they analyzed and they
80:12 - figured out why each one they they wrote
80:14 - up their own opinions on why this game
80:16 - was Hot or Not 30 of them so go play 30
80:19 - horror games we got the Steam summer
80:21 - sale coming up so if you're thinking of
80:23 - making a game that's the best time to
80:24 - buy because it'll be on sale um so buy
80:27 - all the horror games you can that are
80:28 - kind of like good sellers buy some that
80:30 - aren't good sellers so you can see
80:31 - what's bad some buy some that are
80:33 - terrible sellers so you know that like
80:35 - oh this is what you don't want to do and
80:37 - then just analyze them write a one
80:39 - sentence summary of why you think that
80:41 - game's good or bad and what they did
80:42 - that was interesting you got to do your
80:44 - research like play the games learn the
80:46 - genre like you are an expert and I find
80:49 - that a lot of Indies don't do that
80:51 - enough they're just like oh I saw one
80:52 - screenshot of a horror game I'm going to
80:53 - make it and the players like what the
80:55 - hell is this it's like this person
80:57 - looked at one screenshot and made a game
80:58 - off of it they know fans of the genre
81:01 - know yeah being able to do research
81:03 - whether it be on on uh Steam Reviews or
81:06 - over here on how long to beat this is
81:07 - actually a great website in order to see
81:09 - just how big a game is so yeah I guess
81:11 - for that question you can just go search
81:13 - for a bunch of horror games put them
81:14 - here see how long and yeah I guess for
81:17 - horror games they really don't require
81:19 - too much so yeah that's one of the
81:20 - reason why it's such a great genre and
81:22 - somewhat related to uh how long the game
81:24 - is here's a great question which is how
81:26 - should I price my game so usually
81:29 - sometimes get a bit annoyed if a game is
81:30 - like I don't know 15 bucks but it's only
81:32 - got two hours other times a game for
81:34 - five bucks and someone will leave a
81:36 - negative review even if it has like 50
81:37 - hours so yeah this is a really tricky
81:39 - question a while ago you were talking
81:40 - about how Indies should up their price
81:42 - because Indies are constantly devaluing
81:43 - themselves so I feel this is a very
81:45 - tricky question so can you give some
81:47 - sort of an answer how do I price my
81:49 - game well check my blog just search PR
81:53 - price and I think in general the reason
81:56 - people leave bad reviews is if you don't
82:00 - meet the genre expectations okay and
82:02 - here's the thing this is another thing
82:04 - Indies don't do enough of they don't
82:05 - understand their their game is in a
82:07 - genre and it's
82:09 - better in general not to be this weird
82:12 - game that has no genre it's a it's a
82:14 - genre that doesn't exist I invented a
82:16 - genre those don't do as well as the ones
82:18 - like nope I'm firmly in the genre I meet
82:21 - all the expectations of the genre I do
82:23 - it and so
82:25 - uh you know this thing of price versus
82:27 - that what you do is you just go to all
82:28 - the games in your genre buy them play
82:31 - them see what the reviews say find out
82:34 - like hey this game has 50 upgrades okay
82:37 - it's 50 upgrades and this game has 20
82:39 - upgrades like this game's much deeper
82:41 - you know you start to find out oh the
82:43 - graphics are really good on this one you
82:44 - start to get a sense of what the games
82:47 - are how well they do and what their
82:49 - price is and so just do the research
82:51 - like pull 30 games of the genre that
82:53 - you're making one in
82:55 - list out the price list out what the
82:56 - reviews are what are the reviews saying
82:58 - are they like oh man this game's a great
83:00 - value I get 50 hours for five and you're
83:03 - like oh okay well this game seems to
83:05 - have underpriced itself whereas this
83:07 - game
83:08 - says oh this game is so bad it like they
83:11 - charged $30 and it's got only 10 hours
83:13 - of content then you're like ah okay
83:15 - that's how much I know it's like crash
83:17 - and a lot of people hate on Steam
83:19 - Reviews that say oh only 10 hours of
83:21 - content and it's too expensive and it's
83:23 - like well yeah games cost
83:25 - that's that's just the world we live in
83:27 - that's the way it works um and so um in
83:31 - general that's the way it goes now one
83:33 - thing with price again search my blog
83:35 - for price of how to do this
83:37 - analysis here's the
83:39 - thing if people don't complain about
83:42 - your price you've priced it too low
83:45 - think about it if somebody doesn't
83:48 - complain about the price you have priced
83:50 - your game too low
83:52 - ideally if you know economics and the
83:55 - the supply and demand your game will be
83:59 - too expensive for some people it just
84:00 - will okay so it's good if somebody
84:04 - complains about your price you're like
84:05 - okay well we just found the price you
84:06 - know what it is there's it's going to be
84:08 - too expensive for some people and the
84:10 - thing is with steam you're always
84:12 - discounting the game every time you can
84:13 - you're supposed to Discount the game and
84:15 - eventually the price will be low enough
84:17 - for that person so and then the other
84:19 - review that you'll get which sounds bad
84:21 - but is actually good is people say oh
84:23 - it's not worth it uh you should buy it
84:25 - when it's on sale yeah here's a secret
84:27 - nobody buys games at full price on Steam
84:30 - everybody buys the game on sale so when
84:32 - the guy says oh I wouldn't buy this game
84:33 - and list it was on sale join the club
84:35 - that is all of steam okay so just
84:38 - toughen out again get that leathery skin
84:40 - out good leathery skin read that blog
84:42 - post howar game.com um how tomarket
84:46 - game.com and then search price and
84:47 - there's a whole I've got the I've got
84:49 - the blog post shown here so yeah
84:50 - definitely go ahead and Link I'm
84:51 - actually going to post a link definitely
84:53 - go ahead and watch that and actually you
84:55 - were just talking about uh discount so
84:57 - here's a really related question which
84:58 - is how often should I put my game on
85:00 - discount or I guess specifically uh like
85:03 - what is the discount strategy that you
85:05 - recommend I know for myself a few years
85:07 - ago I definitely used to Discount way
85:09 - too heavily like within like six months
85:11 - to a year I would get my game down to
85:13 - 75% I definitely think I did that way
85:15 - too fast I uh like with my latest game
85:17 - I'm definitely going much slower
85:19 - nowadays I think I've discount like
85:20 - three times and I think I'm only putting
85:22 - it at like 20% just pretty much to
85:23 - trigger the the wish list emails but
85:25 - yeah do you have any advice on
85:27 - specifically uh uh discount strategy and
85:30 - how to do
85:32 - that yep and uh let me just see here I
85:36 - back to the course uh we talk um how
85:39 - post launch you know converting the wish
85:41 - list there's a whole section on how this
85:42 - works and here's um so again I go I
85:46 - cover you from beginning Cradle to grave
85:48 - on your game on how to do this stuff in
85:50 - general though like like um Hugo said
85:53 - it's it's a stair step you should always
85:55 - discount when you can okay because you
85:58 - can do it every 30 days and they have a
86:00 - calendar widget now where you can just
86:01 - program in the the the dates all the
86:03 - time and then you should always do the
86:05 - summer and the winter and the seasonal
86:07 - sales because those do not count to your
86:09 - cool down because you can't discount it
86:11 - every single day there's a cool down you
86:13 - can only do it certain period of time
86:15 - and those um big sales don't count as a
86:17 - cool down okay so you should go ahead
86:19 - and schedule out all of those for the
86:21 - year you should never miss a sale
86:23 - because time moves forward and if you
86:25 - miss that discount you can't do it again
86:28 - and remember I said people only buy
86:29 - games on sale you just missed out
86:31 - forever in all time that month where you
86:34 - did not discount your game so you should
86:35 - always discount every chance you can and
86:38 - you should stair step don't go too deep
86:40 - too fast because there's this thing
86:41 - called historic low and if you discount
86:44 - your game to like 75% right away you
86:47 - missed all the times you could have done
86:48 - it 50% 65% you know like each level down
86:52 - because you're just shaving off users
86:55 - that have different price discrimination
86:57 - like I only buy it when it's 75% off
86:58 - I'll only buy it when it's 90% off if
87:00 - you go too fast too deep you lo you just
87:03 - gave away all that stuff so don't do
87:05 - that be careful but do it all the time
87:07 - always discount yep definitely always
87:09 - take the advantage I'm pretty sure steam
87:10 - is like every six weeks I think so yeah
87:12 - definitely go on to the steam page and
87:15 - yep on the calendar they updated it like
87:16 - a few months ago and like you can set
87:18 - your discounts for like the next year
87:19 - and so on definitely go ahead and
87:21 - definitely take every opportunity you
87:22 - can because I mean anytime discount I
87:25 - notice it with my own games like it's
87:27 - six it's every six weeks so it's pretty
87:29 - much one month you can discount the
87:30 - other month you can't and I very much
87:32 - notice how it's like a 50% difference in
87:34 - revenue between one month and another
87:35 - one so yeah definitely do not miss that
87:37 - one that is a a very important thing and
87:40 - uh I guess speaking sorry go ahead no no
87:43 - I I totally agree you you can tell you
87:45 - can tell you can see when games go on
87:47 - discount based on the review counts oh
87:49 - yeah definitely and uh I guess speaking
87:51 - about money what do you think about
87:52 - crowdfunding I got to say that is one
87:54 - that I haven't really uh followed much
87:56 - but as far as I know Kickstarter
87:58 - nowadays is much much difficult than it
88:00 - was previously I think nowadays you
88:01 - pretty much need like a ton of marketing
88:03 - beats like it's even more intense than
88:05 - just doing a regular uh steam release
88:07 - but yeah that's a one that I haven't
88:09 - followed along much so do you know how
88:11 - difficult it is is it a viable option so
88:15 - I don't know I don't know uh Kickstarter
88:17 - I just don't I don't study that that
88:19 - space I don't I don't study it most
88:21 - people I've talked to they say the other
88:23 - Indies that I talked to they say it's
88:24 - more of a marketing beat than actually
88:26 - funding your game so I don't
88:29 - know yeah kickstar does seem like very
88:33 - much doing game on hard modes really
88:35 - difficult uh so yeah here's another
88:36 - interesting question which is uh if
88:38 - you're going to make a multiplayer game
88:40 - so is it wise to make it free to play
88:42 - and then offer an inapp purchase to
88:44 - unlock the full game or I guess as far
88:46 - as I know I my initial response to this
88:48 - is this probably not good I don't think
88:50 - the steam audience reacts very well to
88:52 - unlocking full game so I guess maybe a
88:54 - more general question would be have you
88:56 - seen any sets for Indie devs trying to
88:58 - go the freeo playay right route with
89:00 - inapp purchases has that ever worked out
89:02 - well I feel like that is a very
89:04 - high-risk High reward thing especially
89:06 - for Indie devs yeah freeo play is very
89:09 - very very hard on Steam and multiplayer
89:12 - is very very very hard on Steam I don't
89:15 - I don't that is the ultimate hard and
89:17 - then if you throw in Early Access you're
89:19 - just I don't know who what kind of
89:20 - masochist you are you are just a crazy
89:22 - person I'm just kidding I'm just kiding
89:24 - but it is so hard to do those um I was
89:28 - talking to somebody who had a successful
89:30 - freet toplay game that has crashed in
89:32 - other words no users on it nobody buys
89:34 - anything after three years he says I
89:36 - don't know of any games really other
89:38 - than like csgo which is run by Valve
89:40 - that after five years is still in
89:42 - operation a a freeo playay game a freeo
89:45 - playay on Steam is just so hard very few
89:48 - games do well um the the typical steam
89:51 - game is paid up front not you know yes
89:54 - multiplayer games do well but for us
89:56 - Indies it multiplayer is so so so so so
89:59 - hard so most Indies find success by
90:02 - being paid UPF front not multiplayer I
90:05 - mean there could be Co-op but not like
90:07 - you join a server and you battle on a on
90:08 - an arena that is so hard to do so not a
90:12 - big fan of freeo play it's just so hard
90:14 - it's really hard yeah freeo play really
90:16 - seems like a if Early Access is hard
90:19 - mode then freet to play seems to be like
90:20 - hard mode on steroids really insane
90:22 - really difficult uh mode deadly
90:25 - definitely uh so here's another also
90:28 - very interesting question which is let's
90:30 - say you've launched a game and after a
90:31 - while sales have dropped to basically
90:33 - zero which is normal I mean every game
90:34 - kind of uh drops off so at what point is
90:37 - it worthwhile trying to push new content
90:39 - updates to try to basically get the ball
90:41 - running try to increase sales is that
90:43 - wise or should you really move on to the
90:45 - next one and I guess a second question
90:47 - over here which is how effective are the
90:49 - steam discoverability rounds I got to
90:51 - say I haven't used those in quite a
90:52 - while I do know about but yeah I haven't
90:56 - I I know they were nerfed like three
90:57 - years ago like previously they would get
90:59 - that shown to pretty much everyone
91:00 - whereas nowadays they only get shown to
91:02 - the people who already own the game as
91:03 - far as I know that's how it works so I
91:05 - don't know how much effect that has so
91:08 - yeah do you have any stats on that
91:09 - something yeah and again the course
91:12 - talks about this so um in so much more
91:15 - depth but in general here's here's
91:17 - here's high level what's what's
91:19 - Discovery rounds don't don't matter they
91:21 - don't do anything anymore here's the
91:23 - here's the honest truth folks
91:25 - um steam only cares if your game makes
91:28 - money in my in my opinion um it's based
91:34 - on a lot of clients and you know doing
91:36 - this long enough about 150 if you earn
91:39 - $150,000 within the first six months of
91:42 - your game's release you're you're
91:45 - attractive to steam I call it real steam
91:48 - because really if you reach that kind of
91:51 - tier $150,000 or more within the first
91:54 - six months valve is like this game's got
91:57 - potential and they give you things that
92:00 - you can do you can do daily deals
92:01 - weekend Deals they feature you in
92:03 - festivals they do all kinds of stuff for
92:05 - you popups and all these things they
92:08 - actually promote your game Steam does
92:11 - and it is awesome and that is how you
92:13 - make a living that's how you make a
92:14 - living doing this is you get into real
92:16 - Steam and then steam gives you tools
92:18 - that you can use if you don't make that
92:20 - if you're under
92:22 - $150,000 and it's within the first 6
92:25 - months steam's like thanks for playing
92:27 - they they don't say it explicitly but
92:29 - they're like thanks for playing better
92:31 - luck next time and you really don't have
92:33 - any tools there's no I mean you can
92:35 - discount your game like I said we said
92:37 - the discount this amount over time but
92:39 - you're never going to achieve those
92:41 - those big numbers it's it's done and so
92:44 - what I typically recommend is yes
92:47 - discount all the time but it's time to
92:50 - move on I say do a couple updates you
92:52 - know if you if if you got somewhere
92:55 - around there maybe do one or two updates
92:57 - fix major bugs show the community that
93:00 - you're a good Dev the worst thing that
93:01 - you can do on Steam is just ghost where
93:03 - you just disappear and then Val and then
93:06 - those steam players are like oh this
93:08 - this Dev abandoned the game Dead game no
93:11 - I mean patch it maybe once every six
93:13 - months fix any gamebreaking bugs
93:16 - definitely if your save file corrupts
93:18 - when you play the game definitely fix
93:20 - that make sure the game is
93:21 - stable and then move on start making
93:24 - your next game a sequel something else
93:26 - like that it's time to move on because
93:28 - really the whole the whole of steam is
93:31 - oriented to promote games that have that
93:35 - that velocity that 160,000 within six
93:38 - months somewhere around there that's
93:40 - what the name of the game is if you're
93:41 - not achieving that steam's not going to
93:43 - do anything for you they're like hey
93:45 - thanks good better luck next time okay
93:48 - it's hard truth um but that's kind of
93:50 - what I I teach in the class is how to
93:52 - get to that level so that steam will
93:54 - promotee you yeah it definitely is uh
93:57 - seems very a very harsh world so yeah
94:00 - you definitely need to put your best
94:01 - foot forward and come out of the gate as
94:03 - strong as possible and if not then it
94:05 - becomes quite difficult to to get out so
94:08 - yeah definitely don't uh neglect your
94:11 - announcement your release definitely
94:12 - make sure everything is as punished as
94:13 - possible and yeah hopefully it finds
94:15 - success and if it doesn't definitely you
94:17 - hopefully learn quite a lot in order to
94:18 - make the the next one quite a bit better
94:21 - uh and a somewhat related question which
94:24 - is let's say that development is going
94:27 - slower than expected and delays the
94:28 - release date so let's say you announce a
94:29 - release date announce it publicly and
94:31 - then you have to push it back is that
94:34 - going to be negative uh or I guess
94:36 - specifically if I have to choose between
94:38 - okay put out a game that is maybe not
94:40 - quite as ready or pushing it back and
94:43 - potentially annoy the people who have
94:44 - already wish listed who were already uh
94:46 - interested in it is that something that
94:48 - can have a potential negative effect
94:51 - personally I would say it's probably
94:52 - better to wait and I mean I guess it's
94:54 - that whole uh mamoto quote about uh uh a
94:58 - bad game is bad whereas a delayed game
95:00 - is eventually good something like that
95:01 - so I I would say it's probably best to
95:05 - uh wait a little bit and make sure the
95:06 - game is as perfect as can be right off
95:08 - the gate but yep uh go
95:10 - ahead yeah I mean I I don't think people
95:14 - care about the delay as much especially
95:16 - at our scale we're so little um um
95:20 - message it and tell them why you're
95:21 - delaying but really look at why you're
95:24 - delaying I mean if it's obvious like
95:26 - it's a gamebreaking bug or something but
95:29 - in general here's the thing I to be
95:31 - honest uh Hugo I don't like that mamoto
95:34 - quote because it leads to Indies
95:37 - spending too long on their game and if
95:41 - it mean if you're delaying like a year
95:42 - or six months or something you're like
95:44 - well I I I want to delay because I want
95:46 - to switch to a new engine or I want to
95:48 - do this I I I want to kind of Polish up
95:51 - the game like for the most most
95:54 - part if you are not having that okay I'm
95:58 - going to go deeper here remember how I
96:00 - talked about wish list velocity if your
96:02 - velocity is not high you're nowhere near
96:04 - reaching the minimum which is 7,000 wish
96:06 - lists if you are nowhere near that or
96:09 - it's like man if I just polish the game
96:11 - one more time if I do one more polishing
96:13 - pass if I just redo this one boss if I
96:16 - just um add a cape to the guy to the
96:19 - main character I think that's going to
96:20 - do it in general if that's the case I
96:22 - don't think that's worth delaying
96:24 - because it is very hard to make up those
96:28 - sales with that extra time that you
96:31 - added okay and I'm just being totally
96:33 - honest it is like is very hard to make
96:35 - enough to justify delaying but the
96:38 - exception is if your game is a hot hot
96:41 - game if your game is like you're sitting
96:43 - on 100,000 wish list you get like 300
96:45 - wish list a day there's a lot of
96:47 - expectations behind your game and it is
96:49 - hot then I think it makes sense to delay
96:52 - to make sure the game is bulletproof
96:55 - because even if you have a 100,000 wish
96:57 - list and everybody's super excited your
96:58 - game is hot the wish list velocity is
97:00 - off the charts they stuff those
97:02 - benchmarks that I've done if your game
97:05 - disappoints it's not as fun it's janky
97:08 - it's buggy then all that Goodwill that
97:11 - you built up that velocity is going to
97:14 - be lost and people are going be like
97:15 - this game's crap I've seen this before
97:17 - games that have gone in hot but they're
97:19 - buggy or something's wrong with them or
97:21 - janky sales crash that is bad and so if
97:25 - you're high velocity lots of wish lists
97:27 - then it makes sense to delay to really
97:29 - polish it up but if you're barely
97:31 - getting wish lists and you're hoping
97:33 - that if I delay I can get more wish
97:35 - lists I don't think that's the best do
97:37 - your time release it in the best state
97:39 - it can go keep patching it and then move
97:42 - on to your next game because every game
97:43 - you release you get better and better
97:46 - and you get more and more of an audience
97:48 - so that's kind of my recommendation
97:49 - depending on where you are yeah I
97:51 - definitely agree I mean like you said
97:52 - with that mamoto quote yeah I definitely
97:55 - do agree that it has to be dependent on
97:56 - the game being good definitely do not do
97:59 - not keep delaying a game for like three
98:00 - years five years and so on without any
98:02 - proof that the game is actually going to
98:04 - be hit so if you are something like
98:06 - Jason sorry mentioned s song yeah if you
98:08 - are s song with a mountain of people
98:09 - waiting for you then yeah absolutely
98:11 - delaying can indeed make quite a lot of
98:14 - sense so yeah definitely here's the
98:16 - thing remember mamoto is the world's
98:19 - greatest game designer and he works for
98:21 - a publicly traded company
98:24 - that is worth billions of dollars his
98:26 - advice remember how I said there's AAA
98:29 - rules and there's our rules that is kind
98:32 - of a triaa rule you know what I mean
98:34 - where it's like they live in a different
98:37 - world in a different they're playing a
98:38 - different game than we are we are small
98:40 - little specks of
98:43 - bacterium yeah there are definitely
98:45 - multiple worlds and multiple RS to fall
98:48 - here's a here's a really interesting
98:49 - question I'm pretty sure you made a a
98:51 - blog post on this a while ago with which
98:53 - is uh basically have you seen any
98:55 - positive or negative effect on the use
98:56 - of AI games like or or rather using AI
98:59 - to make games like there are a lot of
99:01 - people who think okay these AI tools
99:03 - they really make you really efficient at
99:04 - producing all kinds of visual ass and so
99:06 - on so soon enough steam is going to be
99:08 - flooded with tons of trash I mean I'm
99:10 - pretty sure people have said the exact
99:11 - same thing back when green light was
99:12 - announced back when steam direct was
99:14 - announced and so on so yeah do you have
99:16 - you seen like an increase in let's call
99:18 - it trash games games that aren't really
99:20 - competing for attention like is that
99:22 - something that
99:23 - is happening nowadays thanks to all
99:25 - these uh all these tools that exist
99:29 - nowadays yeah okay so I have no opinions
99:31 - on AI I don't I don't whatever you say
99:34 - always makes one side mad I don't I
99:35 - don't know I don't have an opinion on AI
99:37 - I just don't care um but the side effect
99:40 - the second order effect is what you said
99:42 - like does this is this going to lead to
99:45 - a flood of garbage and that means it's
99:47 - going to be impossible to sell a game on
99:48 - Steam um and so what I did was analysis
99:52 - last year I looked at all the games
99:55 - released and how many games have been
99:56 - released and how well they sold and I
99:59 - kind of broke them down into tears and
100:01 - what I found was this graph right here
100:03 - this called a worm chart um most games
100:07 - on Steam so last year there were about
100:10 - 14, 500 I think somewhere around there
100:13 - games released on Steam and these are
100:14 - over the time so these are the years so
100:16 - this is when steam first opened all the
100:18 - way to now and then how many games were
100:21 - released and then each color is how many
100:23 - reviews those games got so the blue bar
100:25 - is z to 10 reviews less than 10 this
100:28 - orange is 50 to 10 and then all the
100:30 - other tiar so most games are kind of
100:33 - garbage like and I don't mean that
100:35 - pejoratively I just mean that it's like
100:38 - they're firsttime games they don't know
100:41 - they've never made it they've never if
100:43 - you market like the stuff I teach in the
100:44 - course if you do pretty well you're
100:46 - going to get at least 50 reviews so what
100:48 - I say is most of these games are just
100:50 - games that are very amateur they don't
100:51 - know what they're doing they haven't
100:52 - studied the Market that's most of the
100:54 - games the other games have been quite St
100:59 - like steady like the real games there
101:02 - aren't that many new real games on Steam
101:06 - okay and so I have a feeling the AI
101:09 - flood is just going to flood this higher
101:12 - but it doesn't matter these two the
101:14 - orange and the blue bars the steam how I
101:17 - said if your game doesn't sell $160,000
101:20 - within the first six months steam just
101:21 - Smothers it it suppresses it
101:24 - that's what's Happening Here steam will
101:26 - suppress these games so if next year
101:29 - after the AI flood this blue bar is like
101:32 - twice as high it's not going to matter
101:34 - these games you do not see these games
101:36 - on Steam it is so hard to even see them
101:38 - the only way I see and can count them is
101:40 - I have to go to a scraping site called
101:42 - vgn sites that scrapes every game and I
101:45 - filter for them you will no matter how
101:47 - far you click deep into steam you will
101:50 - never see them steam basically
101:51 - suppresses these games they are never
101:53 - see
101:53 - and so the steam algorithm is very good
101:55 - at this so even if the number of AI
101:57 - games doubles the number you will never
102:00 - see them you will only see these games
102:02 - that do very well and you're like well
102:04 - how how do I become one of these games
102:06 - that's what the course is for I teach
102:07 - you all the steps all the all the things
102:10 - you just have to you just have to really
102:11 - manage your marketing correctly and then
102:13 - you're eligible for this the real
102:15 - competition the thing that keeps people
102:16 - from becoming professionals or like Pro
102:20 - almost professionals is right in this
102:22 - competition between these bars these
102:23 - bars are the ones that are really
102:24 - competing against each other and it is
102:26 - competitive out there but for the most
102:28 - part it's people who are real developers
102:30 - who really study the craft who really
102:32 - understand what they're doing those it
102:33 - is getting competitive but it's within
102:35 - here it's not you're not competing about
102:37 - with these it's the these are like
102:40 - you're not competing against elementary
102:42 - school children you're competing against
102:44 - Real athletes here that's where this
102:46 - competition is and that's what the
102:47 - course kind of teaches you is how to get
102:49 - that advantage to get into this
102:51 - competition I don't care about this this
102:53 - I don't think is matter and I think
102:54 - people are worried about the AI flood
102:55 - there's going to be another article oh
102:57 - 17,000 games were released
102:59 - 100,000 that doesn't matter because most
103:01 - of those games are crap it's these this
103:03 - is what you really have to worry about
103:04 - is this little very consistent number of
103:07 - games that do pretty well but not great
103:09 - okay so that's my theory on the AI
103:16 - flood just just a heads up I gotta I
103:19 - gotta leave at the top of the hour so I
103:20 - can answer maybe one more question
103:51 - very good
103:58 - I can do like maybe one more question
104:00 - really quick I got to end at the top of
104:02 - the hour
104:16 - so can I say one month
104:24 - yeah I there are look up um the
104:27 - developer of cozy games um cozy cozy b
104:31 - games is the name cozy b games she
104:33 - released a game like one month then
104:35 - three months then four months then two
104:37 - months like she released games very
104:40 - quickly in very small amounts she's
104:42 - she's working on a game that's a lot
104:43 - longer but in general Indies are
104:45 - spending way too long on their games
104:47 - they're making the wrong type of game
104:49 - they're making games that are too story
104:51 - based too linear and it's just taking
104:53 - way too long and you in the beginning
104:56 - you need to release very quick games um
104:59 - I think we lost sight of that back in
105:01 - the day when Hugo was making Flash games
105:04 - flash games were put out like once a
105:06 - month for a lot of these steps and I
105:07 - think that's the right attitude now I
105:09 - will be clear those games that you make
105:11 - in one month two months three months are
105:13 - not going to sell well they won't but
105:15 - what you're doing is you were learning
105:17 - how to make games and then after you've
105:20 - done this enough you will start to get
105:22 - good do this for 10 months a game a
105:24 - month for 10 months really work on it or
105:27 - try it for two months make a game every
105:29 - two months but you should be making
105:32 - small games to learn the
105:34 - trade and then after that after your
105:36 - 10th game then you can go to the one-ear
105:38 - long games and what you're doing is
105:40 - you're also building on your Tech don't
105:41 - make one game in one genre and then a
105:43 - different genre maybe make a city
105:45 - Builder every month and every month the
105:48 - city Builder becomes more and more
105:49 - complex now again these games won't sell
105:52 - well it takes a long time to make and
105:54 - market a top selling game but the most
105:57 - important thing is you are learning and
105:59 - yes charge money for these games yes put
106:01 - them on Steam but don't worry you won't
106:04 - get a black mark because you're
106:05 - releasing so many games it is good to
106:07 - learn how to make games okay so yeah
106:11 - that is definitely my final thought
106:13 - folks don't give up after your first
106:14 - game and don't make your dream game for
106:16 - your first game for God's sake please
106:17 - don't do that yeah very good and I
106:20 - actually messed up so my my mic was
106:22 - muted but I'm pretty sure people
106:23 - understood from your answer so how long
106:24 - to to make your first game so anyways
106:27 - Chris if people want to continue
106:28 - learning from you learning about
106:29 - marketing how to get more wishless sales
