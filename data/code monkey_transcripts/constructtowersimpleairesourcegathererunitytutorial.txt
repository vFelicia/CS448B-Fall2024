00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and in this video we're continuing our
00:03 - resource gatherer AI we're going to use
00:05 - our resources and some simple building
00:07 - construction let's begin
00:11 - so here's our scene I have the two
00:14 - gatherers in here I can select either
00:16 - one of them and I can give them orders I
00:18 - can tell this one to go mind some gold
00:20 - and listen to you chop some wood and
00:22 - they go they gather the note gets
00:24 - depleted as you can see and then they go
00:26 - for another one after some time the note
00:28 - gets replenished and they can mine it
00:31 - again okay great so now that we have
00:34 - this basic ecosystem working let's use
00:36 - our resources to actually build
00:37 - something we're going to construct a
00:39 - tower object and let's say it takes ten
00:41 - wood and five gold so four stars let's
00:44 - go into our game Handler and in here
00:47 - we're going to construct the tower on
00:49 - the right mouse button so let's go on
00:51 - the update make a private void update
00:55 - and in here if input back yet mouse
00:59 - button down and in here we want to test
01:02 - on the right mouse button so that's my
01:04 - button one if we have them in here that
01:07 - we want to construct a tower so to test
01:11 - our logic let's use this p.m. debug
01:13 - quanis which is part of the code mock
01:14 - utilities that you can grab from unity
01:16 - code Maki calm let's go there and do a
01:18 - text pop up on the mouse just to make
01:21 - sure that this is triggering so
01:23 - construct our and let's test right here
01:26 - I am hit the right mouse button and yep
01:28 - we are capturing the right mouse button
01:29 - okay now in here let's test if we have
01:32 - enough resources so in order to do that
01:35 - we are going to go if game resources and
01:38 - in that class we have the function get
01:41 - resource amount then we take the
01:43 - resource type which in this case let's
01:46 - first test for wood and let's test if
01:49 - the wood amount if it is bigger than 10
01:52 - and again get resource amount of our
01:56 - gold and we're going to make sure that
01:58 - it is above 5 so if in here then we do
02:02 - have resources tell us not enough
02:07 - resources so in here the CM debug
02:14 - all right so we are testing if we have
02:16 - ten wood and five gold so let's see okay
02:20 - so just like that we had zero zero so if
02:22 - I click no resources
02:23 - okay so let's grab some gold and some
02:26 - wood okay we have twelve gaunt of wood
02:33 - and if I right click yep we now have
02:35 - resource okay great so in here if we do
02:37 - have resource then we're going to spawn
02:39 - a tower if not and we're not going to
02:41 - spawn before we do spawn the tower we
02:44 - need to remove those resources from the
02:46 - game resource game resources and in here
02:49 - we need a function to remove resource
02:51 - amount and we're going to move remove
02:55 - game resources that resource type remove
02:58 - would let's say ten and remove five of
03:02 - gold so let's go into that class and
03:06 - make this function so in here make a
03:08 - public static void remove resource
03:11 - amount and here we're going to take a
03:13 - resource type and also an amount and in
03:17 - here simply do the same thing that we
03:18 - did in here and also fire the event sort
03:22 - of increasing we decrease okay great so
03:24 - we can now remove resources from this
03:26 - class all right so let's test again make
03:28 - sure the resource are being removed okay
03:31 - here I am no resources tell them to
03:33 - gather there they go
03:35 - all right we have enough now let's try
03:36 - and poof has resource and as you can see
03:39 - they were removed okay great so the
03:41 - logic for testing our resource amount
03:44 - and removing them is working perfectly
03:46 - right now let's visually spawn the tower
03:48 - in order to keep our code clean let's
03:51 - first create a tower class so let's
03:53 - create a new C sharp script and let's
03:55 - name it tower now in here we're going to
03:57 - make this a simple class so remove
03:59 - monobehaviour and these functions and
04:01 - first of all let's make a static
04:03 - function to try to spend the resources
04:05 - so make a public static ball try spend
04:09 - resources cost
04:12 - and in here we're going to do the test
04:15 - for the resource cost which we used in
04:18 - here so copy this code and drop it in
04:21 - here so this class is the one that is
04:24 - responsible for testing how much
04:26 - eight-hour cost and removing that cost
04:28 - so in here if we do have resources then
04:30 - we return a true if not then we return a
04:33 - false okay so now back in our game
04:36 - handler instead of using this we're
04:39 - going to do if tower dot try spend the
04:42 - resources cost if that one returns true
04:44 - then we have spent the resources so in
04:47 - here let's construct a tower so we're
04:49 - going to make a tower and make a create
04:51 - function so let's make our public static
04:54 - create function so public static it will
04:57 - return a tower object and let's call it
04:59 - create now in here we're going to
05:01 - receive a vector3 for the position to
05:04 - spawn the tower and we're also going to
05:06 - receive a transform for the tower prefab
05:10 - okay now in here let's instantiate that
05:13 - prefab in sin she ate it into the
05:18 - position and put turn n dot identity
05:21 - then we're going to create a tower
05:23 - object and make a new tower and give it
05:26 - the tower transform and then we're going
05:29 - to return that and down here let's make
05:31 - our constructor for the tower which will
05:35 - receive a transformed for the tower
05:37 - transfer all right so we're doing this
05:42 - just to keep our code nice and clean so
05:44 - we call this function from the outside
05:45 - and this function returns the only
05:47 - constructed tower object so let's go
05:49 - into our game handler so let's go up
05:51 - here and add another serialize field for
05:53 - our tower prefab
05:55 - okay that's what we're going to send to
05:58 - instantiate and for the position let's
06:00 - go into the utils class and get the
06:02 - mouse world position ok so this is the
06:05 - code for now now let's make that prefab
06:07 - so in here I have various sprites for
06:09 - the tower and various stages of
06:10 - construction so here let's create an
06:13 - empty game object we're going to get a
06:15 - sprite renderer and let's just give it
06:18 - the phone tower just for now ok so
06:20 - that's all we need for the prefab so
06:23 - let's go up here create a new prefab
06:25 - let's go
06:26 - PAF town we're going to drag this in
06:29 - there okay so let's drag the prefab in
06:31 - here and let's test now in order to make
06:34 - testing easier and let's go into the
06:36 - game resources and in here when we
06:37 - initialize instead of starting with zero
06:40 - let's start with nine nine nine this is
06:42 - just so testing is easier so we don't
06:44 - have to wait for our gatherers to gather
06:47 - the resources so let's go all right I
06:49 - have nine nine nine and if I right click
06:51 - yep there you go the tower has been
06:54 - spawned and the cost went down okay
06:56 - great
06:56 - now let's an oldy tower construction so
06:59 - back in our tower script in here on
07:02 - let's spawn it in construction and do a
07:03 - simple construction tech timer so first
07:06 - let's grab a reference to the sprite
07:08 - renderer sprite renderer and we're going
07:11 - to grab it based on the tower transform
07:14 - docket component type sprite Brennan so
07:18 - now first let's set the sprite we start
07:20 - with the first construction sprite and
07:23 - now we're going to do a simple
07:24 - construction take timer if you've seen
07:26 - the video on the time.take system this
07:28 - would be a great place to use it but for
07:30 - now let's do the logic in a very simple
07:32 - way so in here let's simply make a
07:34 - private int for the construction tick
07:37 - and a private int for the construction
07:39 - tick max so down here let's start off
07:43 - the construction tick at zero and set
07:45 - the construction take max to be in let's
07:47 - say ten now let's make a function a
07:50 - private void increase construction tick
07:53 - and in here if the construction tick if
07:57 - it is under construction technics then
08:00 - we're going to increase it and here let
08:02 - us also swap the sprite so do a switch
08:05 - on our construction tick we have a total
08:09 - of four sprites so in here let's first
08:11 - put on three
08:17 - okay so in here we are very similar
08:19 - changing the construction based on the
08:21 - tick if you wanted this to be applicable
08:23 - to more than just this tick max you
08:25 - would do some simple calculation to get
08:27 - a normalized value but in this case
08:29 - let's just leave it like this to keep it
08:30 - nice and simple so this function is
08:32 - increasing our construction takes and
08:34 - updating the sprite let us also make a
08:36 - private ball for testing if is
08:39 - constructing and to simply return if the
08:43 - construction tick if it is under
08:45 - construction take backs and this is what
08:48 - we're going to use up here to keep our
08:50 - code very nice and descriptive and now
08:53 - up here let us actually trigger this
08:56 - function so in order to do that we're
08:57 - going to use the function periodic we're
09:00 - going to use it to trigger the increased
09:02 - construction tick and we're going to
09:04 - increase it every and let's say second
09:06 - so every second this function won't be
09:08 - triggered this function won't test if it
09:10 - is constructing if so it won't increase
09:12 - the tick and update the sprite so let's
09:15 - see if all that is working okay so here
09:17 - I am I right click there's the tower and
09:19 - it is Colonel in construction as you see
09:21 - the sprite that's right and yep now it's
09:24 - fully built okay great so we have the
09:26 - construction time we're being activated
09:28 - and increasing and the tower is
09:30 - constructing okay
09:31 - now let's add a construction bar so here
09:34 - we're going to use the world bar which
09:37 - again is on the code monkey Tonys to
09:39 - create a construction bar trying to
09:43 - create a new one let's place it as a
09:45 - child of this transform and put it
09:47 - slightly under
09:59 - going to store that construction bar as
10:02 - a member variable so that we can go down
10:08 - here and after we increase the construct
10:10 - untick let's actually update it so in
10:12 - order to do that we do need to calculate
10:14 - a normalized value so let's we flew
10:17 - construction normalized which will be
10:21 - the construction tick x 1f in order to
10:24 - convert it into a float and then divide
10:26 - by the construction takes max so this is
10:29 - the normalized value that we're going to
10:31 - do use set size and set the size of our
10:34 - construction bar okay so let's test here
10:38 - I am and if I right click yep there's
10:40 - the tower and there's the bar as you can
10:41 - see it is increasing on every tick and
10:44 - yep it's foam that's completely okay
10:46 - great
10:46 - so we got the tower construction fully
10:49 - working now let's actually do something
10:51 - when the tower is fully constructed for
10:53 - example let's spawn another together so
10:56 - in order to do that let's make a prefab
10:57 - a new prefab and let's make it the PF
11:01 - together unit now we're going to drag
11:04 - this in here so now let's go into the
11:06 - game Handler and at mother's he realized
11:09 - field for the gatherer unit prefab now
11:14 - in order to spawn our gatherer we're
11:15 - going to pass in a function on our tower
11:18 - create so in here when we create let's
11:21 - also pass in an action which we have to
11:24 - go up here and do using the system now
11:26 - this action will actually do something
11:29 - when the tower is fully constructed so
11:31 - in here let's call it on tower
11:33 - constructive action and we're going to
11:38 - pass it on to our constructor and
11:40 - receive it down here
11:42 - okay this is our action let's store it
11:45 - internally
11:50 - okay so now down here if construction
11:55 - tic if it is equal to the construction
11:58 - techniques then the tower is fully
12:01 - constructed so in here let's also hide
12:04 - our bar so hide this construction bar
12:08 - and we're going to trigger this action
12:11 - so the tower doesn't care what happens
12:13 - when it's constructed it just receives
12:15 - an action and triggers it so now let's
12:17 - go back into our game hammer so in here
12:20 - let's make a private void spawn gatherer
12:24 - unit and we're going to receive a
12:26 - vector3 for the position and what we're
12:29 - going to do is in sin she ate our
12:31 - gatherer unit prefab spawn it on the
12:36 - position returning that identity okay
12:38 - and that's all we need to do to spawn
12:41 - and you gather up so in here and let's
12:43 - give it the action that won't trigger on
12:45 - construction and the action that you
12:47 - will execute won't be spawn and gather a
12:50 - unit on this position so in here let's
12:54 - make a vector3 for the tower spawn
12:56 - position which will be this use that in
12:59 - here and down here and let's go on
13:03 - together unit in that and let's put it a
13:05 - bit under so new vector3 let's say on
13:07 - 0-2 okay so on right-click we try to
13:10 - spend the resources if we can't spend
13:12 - the resources necessary to construct it
13:14 - tower then we actually construct the
13:16 - tower we get the tower spawn position
13:18 - based on the mouse position we create a
13:21 - tower using the tower prefab when the
13:24 - tower is fully constructed it won't fire
13:25 - this action and this action won't spawn
13:28 - a new gatherer on the spawn position
13:30 - well as - ooh so a bit under the tower
13:32 - and this won't simply instantiate the
13:35 - gather prefab so let's see if all of
13:37 - that is working exactly as intended okay
13:40 - so here I am the resource up back on 0
13:42 - so let's grab this one tell them to
13:44 - gather some gold this one gather some
13:47 - wood and if I right-click you can see
13:49 - nothing happens because we do not have
13:51 - enough resources so let's see them grab
13:54 - and then we can test so go three wood
13:56 - three let's wait until we have ten wood
13:59 - and five gold so you can see nothing
14:01 - happened so let's wait
14:03 - okay we now have enough so if I right
14:06 - click yep there's a tower there's the
14:08 - construction bar it's going up these
14:10 - prices updating and yep the tower is
14:13 - fully constructed the bar disappeared
14:15 - and we now have any together and I can
14:17 - select them and tell them go mine this
14:19 - and there he goes and once I've got
14:21 - enough right now so let's go spawn
14:23 - another one there he goes they are
14:25 - mining and construct and yep there's
14:29 - another one and again tell him to mine
14:31 - and when I got enough I guess what not
14:33 - okay
14:33 - worked so there you have it we
14:35 - constructed a building using the
14:37 - resources that are gatherers picked up
14:39 - the tower has a simple construction
14:41 - timer and when completed it spawned
14:43 - another gatherer that we can use to mine
14:45 - more resources so in this series we
14:47 - covered everything regarding a simple
14:49 - resource gatherer he can look for
14:51 - resource nodes independently or be told
14:53 - where to go the system supports multiple
14:56 - resource types and the nodes have a
14:58 - limited amount of resources they also
15:00 - replenish that resource amount after
15:02 - some time we then add the ability to
15:05 - construct a building using those
15:06 - resources and spawned another gatherer
15:08 - when the building is completed I hope
15:10 - you enjoyed this series and learned
15:11 - something useful from it now go ahead
15:13 - and apply it to your own games as always
15:16 - you can download the project files in
15:18 - utilities from Unity code monkey comm if
15:20 - you have any questions post them in the
15:22 - comments and I'll do my best to answer
15:23 - them subscribe for more videos and I'll
15:26 - see you next time
