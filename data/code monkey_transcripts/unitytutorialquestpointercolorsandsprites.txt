00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - min this video we're going to take our
00:03 - previous UI arrow pointer and customize
00:05 - it with different colors and sprites
00:07 - let's get started
00:11 - so here's the pointers from the previous
00:13 - videos I have several them pointing to
00:15 - different locations when the pointer is
00:17 - on screen it shows a arrow and when it
00:20 - gets on screen it shows a cross and
00:22 - right now when I get near it gets
00:24 - destroyed all right so let's modify the
00:27 - color of our sprites so in here on our
00:29 - create pointer function let's add two
00:32 - parameters one for the arrow color and
00:34 - one for the cross color
00:37 - let's send those two parameters into our
00:39 - quest pointer constructor all right so
00:49 - we are now receiving both colors in our
00:51 - constructor for our quest pointer object
00:53 - and here on our update if it is off
00:57 - screened and we're showing the arrow
00:58 - sprite so let's modify the pointer image
01:01 - color to be our arrow color and in here
01:05 - on our cross right let's use E cross :
01:08 - so on our game hello let's give
01:10 - different colors to our different
01:12 - pointers so in here I'm going to go into
01:14 - the utens class which is part of the
01:16 - code mock utilities which you can grab
01:17 - from ent code monkey comm I'm going to
01:20 - use the get color from string function
01:22 - which essentially allows me to use a hex
01:24 - string and it won't return a color
01:26 - object so let's make this one red so
01:29 - ff0000 and for this one down here let's
01:35 - make it in green and finally down here
01:37 - let's make it in blue and give the exact
01:42 - same color to our process all right so
01:47 - let's test and see if our arrows show
01:49 - different colors yeah there you go that
01:51 - one is blue red and green and as I move
01:54 - the crosses also have the exact same
01:56 - color okay great
01:57 - alright so now let's test giving it a
02:00 - different color to our cross to make
02:02 - sure that one is correct so you have
02:03 - this one a white collar
02:05 - so on the first pointer it should be in
02:07 - red and when I get near the cross should
02:09 - display in white and when I get near and
02:13 - the crosses white yep great so we are
02:15 - correctly giving different colors to
02:18 - each of our pointers now another thing
02:20 - we can easily do since we can modify the
02:23 - colors is to make it Tran
02:24 - Spearin so let's test that now in here
02:27 - get come from strings supports sending a
02:30 - alpha value so with nuf of 0 it should
02:33 - be component ly transparent so there's
02:35 - the arrow and when I get near and poof
02:38 - there you the cross is in there but it
02:40 - is transparent this can be useful if all
02:42 - you want to do is direct the player to
02:44 - an area and not necessarily a very
02:46 - specific position alright so now that we
02:48 - got colors working let's customize our
02:50 - sprites so right now our code is
02:52 - actually already using dynamic sprites
02:55 - we're storing a member variable here and
02:57 - applying it in here but when we are
03:00 - creating we are sending our default
03:02 - sprites let's have the sprites as
03:04 - parameters so let's make a sprite for
03:07 - the arrow sprite and a sprite for the
03:10 - cross sprite let's make them optional so
03:13 - we have the font functionality so by
03:15 - default these won't be no so here it
03:18 - won't be no and here let's simply test
03:21 - if the parameter is no then we're going
03:24 - to set to our window arrow sprite and do
03:28 - the same thing for the across sprite so
03:32 - this way if we feed a normal in here we
03:35 - simply get the default our own sprite so
03:37 - it should be probably good when we don't
03:38 - want something extremely custom ok let's
03:41 - see if everything is still working using
03:43 - the default sprites and there you go the
03:46 - default arrow sprite so let's make a
03:48 - difference right alright so in here I
03:51 - have some different sprites I have a
03:53 - different arrow a different cross type
03:55 - and a exclamation point as if in an MMO
03:59 - so let's first go into our game Handler
04:01 - and add these sprites as serialized
04:03 - field so we can set them in the editor
04:06 - so a custom arrow sprites a custom cross
04:11 - sprite and a exclamation point sprite
04:18 - alright so for the first one let's leave
04:21 - it as is for the second one let's give
04:24 - it the custom arrow sprite and the
04:26 - custom cross sprite and for the third
04:28 - one let's give it the custom arrow
04:30 - sprite and the exclamation point sprite
04:32 - and let's make the exclamation point in
04:35 - yellow so young
04:37 - is red green and zero all right so now
04:40 - in our editor and let's drag our sprites
04:42 - in here
04:43 - okay so let's test and see if one of our
04:45 - customs rights are being correctly used
04:47 - all right as you can see these two
04:49 - sprites are the custom arrows which are
04:51 - different from that one and when I get
04:53 - near yep as you can see that one is
04:55 - using the custom cross sprite that one
04:57 - is using the default when I get close
04:59 - everything still works the same they
05:00 - still vanish and in this one when I get
05:03 - near yep there you go it's using the
05:08 - custom sprite which is a exclamation
05:11 - point and instant in yellow so there you
05:14 - have it we have a customization to our
05:16 - quest pointer to be able to have sprites
05:18 - more applicable to each pointer as
05:20 - always you can download the project
05:21 - files in utilities from indie code
05:23 - monkey comm if you have any questions
05:25 - post them in the comments and I'll do my
05:26 - best answer them subscribe for more
05:28 - videos and I'll see you next time
