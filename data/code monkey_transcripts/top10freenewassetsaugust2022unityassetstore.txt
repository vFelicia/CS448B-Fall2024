00:56 - really awesome looking one a shaded
00:58 - calibration scene it's a very simple
01:00 - scene with a bunch of objects where you
01:02 - can apply your materials so it's a great
01:04 - way for testing roughness Reflections
01:06 - Sky boxes you can test special effect
01:08 - shaders some image effects geometry
01:10 - effects and anything else it's a simple
01:12 - reference environment so you can test if
01:13 - your shaders and materials look exactly
01:15 - like you want them to then for a nice
01:17 - pack with a bunch of low poly weapons
01:19 - they have some simple stylized textures
01:21 - and they'll look pretty nice it's a
01:23 - great pack if you want to quickly test
01:25 - out different weapon types in your melee
01:27 - controller up next here is a nice
01:29 - particle Shader it's a Shader that can
01:31 - receive custom data to let you create a
01:33 - bunch of interesting effects so I'd be
01:35 - curious to grab this one to look into
01:36 - how it works and looks pretty simple and
01:39 - results are pretty great then for
01:41 - another simple pack here's a bunch of
01:42 - food you have some donuts pizza hot dogs

02:05 - beds look at this one they all look
02:07 - really nice really cozy it's split into
02:09 - multiple parts so you can make or unmake
02:12 - your Ben and if you like this style then
02:14 - this dev has a bunch more next here we

02:43 - this one is a runtime editor it lets you
02:46 - edit anything any field any data you can
02:49 - change the hierarchy change scenes and
02:50 - so on you can do all of this whilst
02:53 - inside the main game in the window so
02:55 - this can be a great tone for testing all
02:57 - of your builds and if you're making a
02:59 - game set in the 90s then maybe these
