00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and here's a very interesting unique
00:04 - look that I made by combining some
00:05 - Assets Now as you might know I am a
00:07 - programmer I'm definitely not an artist
00:09 - and something else you might know since
00:11 - I'm constantly talking about it is if
00:13 - you want to find success with your games
00:14 - you really need to stand out marketing
00:16 - is the most important thing for Success
00:18 - nowadays you need to send out both in
00:20 - terms of mechanics but also in terms of
00:21 - visuals so for me I cannot make
00:23 - interesting unique art assets but what I
00:26 - can do is make some interesting assets
00:28 - to end up with something that really
00:29 - looks quite awesome that's basically the
00:31 - idea that I had when I first saw the CNT
00:33 - Humble Bundle with a bunch of art tests
00:35 - and tools this bundle is really awesome
00:37 - it has tons of awesome self with a huge
00:39 - 98 discount there's also another bundle
00:42 - cell active this one is all about tools
00:44 - I highly recommend you check out both
00:45 - bundles this one ends in just a few days
00:47 - so the Earth bundle here has a Cynthia
00:50 - low poly pack which I'm always a huge
00:51 - fan of their style and then there's also
00:54 - this really interesting shaded tone con
00:55 - equipment this one helps you create an
00:57 - anime inspired sound shading look so I
00:59 - thought about combining both of them to
01:01 - achieve an interesting look however when
01:03 - I tried that it didn't exactly work out
01:05 - here is equivalently with the official
01:07 - equivalently demo scene it looks really
01:09 - great the character the background
01:10 - everything looks really awesome and then
01:12 - here is a character from The Cynthia low
01:14 - poly pack and now if I apply the
01:16 - equipment material yep there you go this
01:18 - is normal this would quickly so you can
01:20 - see quite a big difference and depending
01:22 - on the angle it can look good but from a
01:24 - lot of angles it actually looks quite
01:25 - odd now personally I don't like how the
01:28 - Highlight changes so drastically that
01:30 - happens basically because the asset is
01:32 - intentionally low poly so there's not
01:33 - enough polygons for the shading to
01:35 - smoothly change although I should Orient
01:38 - that in the material itself you can
01:39 - enable or disable the rim so if you
01:41 - disable that then it looks a bit like
01:42 - this although I think for a sound shade
01:44 - look it really does need the rim Bissell
01:46 - equivalently is more meant for high
01:47 - polygon Assets in order to benefit from
01:49 - that sound shading look so for example
01:51 - the bundle here also includes a nice
01:53 - little pack with a bunch of dragons
01:55 - here are two dragons from the asset pack
01:58 - this one looks extremely realistic and
02:00 - this one is realistic High probably but
02:02 - a bit more cartoony so on these ones if
02:04 - I do apply the equivalent Shader yep I
02:06 - do think that this doesn't look right
02:07 - this is quite a big change both on that
02:10 - one as well as on this one so on these
02:12 - high polygon models I do think quickly
02:14 - does look quite great you can see as the
02:16 - models move around the highlights no
02:17 - longer change quite drastically now like
02:19 - I said this has tons of options so you
02:21 - can enable or disable the outline you
02:23 - can change the color you can change
02:24 - these thickness and so on you can enable
02:26 - or disable the rim light so tons of
02:29 - options for modifying this Shader as you
02:30 - can see equivalently it doesn't look
02:32 - great if you have high poly assets with
02:34 - complex textures but not so much for a
02:35 - low poly however the bundle has lots of
02:38 - us himself including another art tool
02:40 - this one called Pro pixelizer what this
02:42 - one is is basically a Shader to pixelate
02:44 - your characters and in doing so it also
02:46 - creates a sort of sound shaven look so
02:48 - back on my synthy character here it is
02:50 - using the standard Universal Shader now
02:52 - if I apply the pixel light Shader and
02:54 - you better go quite a nice difference
02:55 - this shade is meant to add a pixelated
02:57 - effect however over here on the settings
02:59 - you can modify the pixel size so you can
03:01 - make it really insanely blocky so if
03:03 - that's what you're looking for but for
03:04 - me personally I'm not a huge fan of
03:06 - super insanely pixel art so for me I can
03:08 - lower it down and pretty much end up
03:10 - with just a really nice cell shaded
03:12 - Shader then this shade also has a bunch
03:14 - more options so I can play around with
03:15 - the outline color make it white red and
03:18 - so on I can play around with the edge
03:19 - highlight which is all of these lines
03:21 - inside personally I think this one looks
03:23 - really great either in black or over
03:25 - here in white I think this one looks
03:26 - really nice so with this visual style I
03:28 - do think that the character over here
03:30 - looks pretty great and here it is
03:32 - applied to all the other assets from
03:33 - this pack so as you can see all the
03:34 - shields of them look great all the web
03:36 - weapons here of them got this nice
03:39 - downlized look whilst not looking too
03:41 - pixelated so I quite like this style I
03:43 - think this one looks pretty great pretty
03:44 - unique it can be applied to every single
03:46 - mesh as you can see then I can also
03:49 - apply that same Shader to some visual
03:50 - effects included in the bundles also
03:52 - this one with a bunch of VFX so here it
03:55 - is one where I add that Shader to make
03:57 - it also a bit pixelized so the Rocks
03:59 - over there the trail everything looks
04:01 - really nice with that bit of deterring
04:03 - for the transparency and by the way for
04:05 - the animations here I'm also using this
04:07 - animation pack from the bummel so if I
04:09 - take that and then I place my characters
04:11 - over here on this gorgeous tune fantasy
04:13 - metal if I do that then here is
04:15 - everything combined looking pretty great
04:17 - now if you post a screenshot of your
04:19 - game looking like this you would
04:20 - definitely send out from the crowd
04:21 - personally I think this town looks quite
04:23 - gorgeous and here are all of them side
04:25 - by side so this one on the left this one
04:27 - is using the equivalent Shader this one
04:28 - in the center this one is using the
04:30 - regular urp Shader and this one on the
04:32 - right this one is using Pro pixelizer so
04:34 - you can see all of them with very
04:35 - distinct Styles doing in the center
04:37 - using the standard Shader this one is
04:38 - pretty standard the one who equivalently
04:41 - does have some more pronounced some
04:42 - lines and then the one with pixelate has
04:44 - a really nice black outline some really
04:46 - nice white in the center and so on so I
04:48 - think this one looks really nice so
04:50 - personally I'm quite happy with these
04:51 - results I think it's pretty unique and
04:53 - it's very easy to do by just combining
04:55 - some assets and if instead you have some
04:57 - high poly meshes then I think quickly
04:59 - can indeed look great like I mentioned
05:01 - both these shaders equivalent Pro
05:03 - pixelizer both of them have tons of
05:04 - options you can play around with so you
05:06 - can enable or disable the outlines you
05:08 - can add highlights add more or less
05:10 - pixelation more and less color bending
05:11 - and so on so both of them are really
05:13 - great for adding a bit of extra on top
05:15 - of your visual assets okay so this was
05:17 - just a fun quick video on what you could
05:19 - build using the assets from the bundles
05:20 - like I said for me I'm not an artist so
05:23 - without this I would only be able to
05:24 - make some basic cubes so being able to
05:26 - add some proper art and make some
05:28 - awesome looking effects and shaders
05:29 - doing that is really great like I said
05:31 - nowadays the trickiest part to making it
05:33 - as an indie game developer is standing
05:34 - out from the crowd so for that I'm quite
05:36 - pleased with the results of this
05:37 - experiment I think this style of using
05:39 - low only assets with a pixel chair on
05:41 - top I think this one looks really good
05:43 - it would definitely help your game stand
05:45 - out from the ground if you want to try
05:46 - it out for yourself check out both
05:47 - panels Linked In the description they
05:49 - have a massive discount 98 off so if
05:52 - just one of these assets looks
05:53 - interesting then the whole thing is
05:54 - worth it I can highly recommend both of
05:56 - them these bundles only happen once or
05:58 - twice a year so make sure you don't miss
06:00 - out this one the tools bundle ends in
06:02 - just a few days and the art bundle ends
06:04 - next week also those links are filmed
06:06 - links so if you pick them up you get
06:08 - some awesome assets and I get a nice
06:09 - commission alright hope that's useful
06:11 - check out these videos to learn some
06:13 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
06:15 - supporters for making these videos
06:16 - possible thank you for watching and I'll
06:18 - see you next time
06:23 - foreign
