00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - here is the game the other ones which
00:04 - feature some interesting mechanics and
00:05 - systems
00:06 - let's inspect and remake the scout
00:08 - launcher you press a button to shoot a
00:10 - probe which has a camera attached to it
00:12 - and you can take shots from that camera
00:14 - and even move it around i won't cover
00:16 - how it works
00:17 - how i remade it and how youtube can make
00:19 - something like this in your own games
00:21 - after watching the video you can go
00:22 - ahead and download the project files and
00:24 - inspect only source code
00:25 - watch the home playlist if you want to
00:26 - learn some more about some other games
00:28 - like for example the cleaning mini game
00:30 - in rover mechanic simulator
00:32 - or the soil moisture system in endzone
00:34 - or warmly part
00:35 - and follow the curator page on sim if
00:37 - you want to see more of these types of
00:38 - videos
00:39 - alright so first just a quick overview
00:41 - of what the game is about to give you
00:42 - some context
00:43 - it's called the outer wilds and it's a
00:45 - very interesting adventure exploration
00:47 - game
00:47 - you're an astronaut going off on your
00:49 - very first mission to explore the solar
00:51 - system
00:52 - you have phone control over your
00:53 - spaceship you can launch from anywhere
00:55 - and land in any place then you'll leave
00:58 - your spaceship and explore on foot
01:00 - each planet is unique with a very
01:02 - different mystery to uncover
01:03 - it is a very mysterious game and has a
01:05 - really awesome central mechanic that i
01:07 - really don't want to spoil here so i
01:08 - won't say
01:09 - anymore if you're into exploration games
01:12 - and uncovering mysteries then definitely
01:13 - give this one a try
01:15 - and if you're just an indie game
01:16 - developer then i would also encourage
01:17 - you to play it
01:18 - because the central mechanic is really
01:20 - just that interesting and very unique
01:22 - also fun fact this game was made with
01:24 - yinty okay so let's inspect and remake
01:26 - the scout launcher it involves using
01:28 - some interesting unity features that you
01:30 - might not know about
01:31 - do you want to master game development
01:33 - and make a full-time living creating
01:34 - games
01:35 - learn how to do it with this video
01:36 - sponsor the ultimate gamedev course
01:38 - it's a massive course model at an
01:40 - extremely low price taught by both
01:42 - jason wyman and thomas brush who
01:44 - together already have over 3 500
01:46 - students worldwide
01:47 - it will teach you everything you need to
01:49 - know to make both 2d and 3d games on a
01:51 - professional level with some good
01:53 - patterns and workflows
01:54 - on top of this it will also teach you
01:56 - how to successfully launch your game and
01:58 - hopefully make a full-time living
02:00 - so you will learn how to work with
02:01 - publishers crowdfunding how to run a
02:03 - successful kickstarter just like thomas
02:05 - himself has done
02:06 - jason is a veteran in the aaa games
02:08 - industry having worked on massively
02:09 - complex titles like everquest 2 and
02:11 - vanguard
02:12 - and thomas has published two games that
02:14 - were very successful and received a
02:15 - bunch of awards and raised hundreds of
02:17 - thousands of dollars from publishers and
02:19 - kickstarter
02:19 - the campaign starts on july 1st and runs
02:22 - for only 30 days or until all of the
02:24 - seats are sold out
02:25 - there's only 300 limited seats available
02:27 - to ensure the best experience possible
02:28 - for all students
02:30 - so go ahead and get the ultimate gamedev
02:32 - course before the seats run out with a
02:33 - link in the description and turn game
02:35 - dev into your dream job
02:36 - okay so let's remake the scout launcher
02:38 - now first let's inspect what happens in
02:41 - the game itself
02:42 - this cover launcher is the tool you can
02:44 - equip and then when you fire it it
02:46 - shoots the scout pro
02:47 - and as it goes an image pops up on the
02:49 - screen that shows what the probe is
02:50 - seeing
02:51 - note how the screen is a ui element on
02:54 - top of the main ui
02:55 - also the probe has a different visual
02:57 - different post processing
02:59 - then by pressing a button you can take
03:00 - another screenshot from the probe and
03:02 - update the view
03:03 - every time we press the button it
03:05 - updates with a new image from the probe
03:06 - camera
03:07 - as for the probe itself it's a simple
03:09 - projectile it gets fired and falls along
03:11 - with gravity
03:12 - once the bottom part of the probe hits
03:14 - something it sticks
03:15 - so if the top part hits something that
03:17 - doesn't stick only the
03:18 - landing gear sticks and the last ability
03:21 - is you can change the angle of the
03:22 - camera
03:23 - so you can look left right up down by
03:25 - pressing some other buttons
03:27 - so you shoot the pro you get an image
03:29 - then you can update that image at will
03:31 - then when it lands somewhere you can
03:33 - press more buttons to rotate the view
03:34 - and see anything around the pro
03:36 - it's a really interesting mechanic and
03:38 - it perfectly matches the game
03:40 - the game is all about exploration so
03:41 - sending a probe out to an undiscovered
03:43 - place
03:44 - is a great mechanic that perfectly fits
03:46 - with the genre so let's see how we can
03:48 - rebuild this which is actually quite
03:49 - easy if you know about one specific
03:51 - unity tool
03:53 - so first of all for the projectile
03:54 - itself it's all very standard
03:57 - i just made the probe game object i add
03:59 - the collider and a rigid body and that's
04:01 - pretty much it for the setup
04:02 - when i press the mouse button it just
04:04 - spawns a probe directly on the camera's
04:06 - position and sets the rigid body
04:08 - velocity based on the player's camera
04:10 - for its vector
04:11 - with that i can look anywhere and shoot
04:12 - out the probe very easily
04:14 - and by the way for the probe visual that
04:16 - i'm using here it's from the
04:18 - simple space asset pack there's a link
04:20 - if you want to get it
04:21 - now for the lending logic i need to know
04:24 - when the bottom part of the object
04:25 - touches something
04:26 - there are many ways to do this you can
04:28 - do it all through code essentially just
04:30 - constantly fire a boxcast
04:32 - or you can do it with colliders which is
04:34 - the approach that i used
04:35 - essentially i just need to position a
04:37 - collider at the bottom of the probe and
04:39 - then listen to collisions
04:41 - now always keep in mind that in order
04:42 - for a collision to occur
04:44 - there must be a rigid body present on at
04:46 - least one of the collision objects
04:48 - i'm saying this because i myself forgot
04:50 - about this rule
04:51 - if you want some more specifics on this
04:52 - rule go check out the video i have made
04:54 - on it
04:55 - it's pretty frustrating when you don't
04:56 - know why it isn't working so make sure
04:58 - you know about it
04:59 - i initially made the landing as a
05:00 - separate piece just with the box slider
05:02 - and it didn't work
05:04 - it didn't work because the landing did
05:05 - not have a rigid body neither did
05:07 - whatever floor it went on
05:09 - so the solution for that was pretty
05:10 - simple instead of making the landing
05:12 - collater on a separate game object i
05:14 - just placed it on the main game object
05:16 - so the main game object has a lending
05:18 - collider and then the physical shape
05:19 - collider is in a child game object
05:22 - it's important that they are separated
05:24 - so i can make sure to only listen to
05:25 - collisions on the
05:26 - landing collider then for the code
05:28 - itself it's very simple
05:29 - just listen to on collision enter this
05:31 - gets triggered once when a collision
05:33 - occurs
05:34 - and when that happens in order to glue
05:36 - the probe it's really just a matter of
05:37 - disabling movement and rotation on the
05:39 - rigid body so just freeze everything so
05:41 - it stays completely fixed
05:43 - but it should also match whatever it
05:45 - lands on you don't want it to stay glued
05:47 - to a surface by the probe's head
05:49 - meaning that what we really want is to
05:51 - rotate the probe to match the normal of
05:53 - whatever surface it landed on
05:54 - so for that we can use the collision
05:56 - parameters which contains data for the
05:58 - exact normal that we need
06:00 - just apply that to the probe
06:01 - transform.up and it automatically
06:03 - rotates to match the surface perfectly
06:05 - so with all of that the probe behavior
06:07 - is working it can be fired and moves
06:09 - like any projectile
06:10 - if the landing gear touches something it
06:12 - gets glued onto that surface
06:14 - by the way if you find the video helpful
06:15 - please hit the like button it's a tiny
06:17 - thing but really does help
06:18 - thanks now for the main part taking the
06:21 - pictures
06:21 - like i said this is super easy to do if
06:23 - you know about one ent feature
06:25 - i'm of course talking about rendered
06:27 - textures this is one of the features
06:29 - that i cover in detail in my ultimate
06:31 - unity overview course
06:32 - so go ahead and get it if you want to
06:34 - learn more about it and 30 other unity
06:36 - tools and features
06:37 - what it does is it lets you render a
06:39 - camera view onto a specific texture
06:41 - instead of directly on the screen
06:42 - so that's really all we need so first
06:44 - create a render texture
06:46 - then assign it to the camera output and
06:48 - then with that random texture just show
06:50 - it on screen
06:51 - to show it there's also one thing you
06:53 - need to know in the ui
06:55 - if you make an image component it only
06:56 - supports showing sprites
06:58 - but the render texture is a texture it's
07:00 - not a sprite so you cannot use
07:02 - it there but there is another component
07:04 - the raw image
07:05 - and this one takes a texture inside of a
07:07 - sprite so you can assign it and with
07:09 - that you can view the render texture on
07:11 - the ui itself
07:12 - then for making it work like the game
07:14 - the pro camera is meant to take
07:16 - pictures and not video so it's not meant
07:18 - to be constantly updating
07:19 - in order to handle that it's very simple
07:21 - just keep the camera disabled so it's
07:23 - not rendering
07:24 - and then when the player press the
07:25 - button simply enable the camera
07:27 - render onto the texture and disable the
07:29 - camera again this way it works like the
07:31 - game taking pictures instead of phone
07:33 - video
07:33 - next up for the visual on the camera
07:35 - it's also different from the main game
07:37 - this is another thing that's very easy
07:39 - to do for adding post processing to your
07:41 - games you create an object and you add
07:43 - the volume component
07:44 - then you can add whatever
07:45 - post-processing you want and then on the
07:48 - camera object you have a field where you
07:50 - can select what post-processing affects
07:52 - that camera
07:52 - specifically it's based on layers so you
07:55 - can define the second post-processing in
07:57 - a new layer
07:58 - and then you set the main camera to
07:59 - ignore that layer and then the pro
08:01 - camera to only apply post processing on
08:03 - that second layer
08:05 - and yep just like that the main camera
08:07 - and pro camera are both using different
08:09 - post processing effects
08:10 - the next thing is just the probe camera
08:12 - rotation also pretty simple
08:14 - you just listen to player input when the
08:16 - player presses a button it's really just
08:17 - a matter of rotating the camera
08:19 - transform
08:20 - so just rotate on the x and y and then
08:22 - after rotating just take another image
08:24 - and yep that's pretty much it so by
08:26 - pressing the buttons you can rotate the
08:28 - image and see
08:29 - everything that pro can see when you put
08:31 - all of that together we have recreated
08:33 - the probe exactly like in the game
08:34 - so it works like a projectile press the
08:36 - button and it gets fired
08:38 - it moves like any projectile and phones
08:40 - along with gravity
08:42 - then for a landing if it touches any
08:44 - object it gets glued onto that object
08:46 - and matches the direction of the surface
08:47 - that will land on
08:48 - as it gets fired it takes a picture of
08:50 - the pro camera
08:52 - the probe camera also has different
08:53 - visual then manually the player can take
08:56 - some more pictures
08:57 - and the player can also rotate the pro
08:59 - camera to see everything around the
09:01 - probe itself
09:02 - alright so there you have it that's how
09:04 - you can recreate the probe launcher from
09:06 - the outer worlds
09:07 - it's a great mechanic and definitely
09:08 - something you can easily add to your
09:10 - games
09:11 - render textures are insanely useful and
09:13 - as you can see they'll let you create
09:14 - some really interesting mechanics
09:16 - check out the phone how it's made
09:17 - playlist follow the curator page on seem
09:19 - and like this video if you want to see
09:21 - more of these types of videos
09:22 - also let me know what other games have
09:24 - some interesting mechanics that you'd
09:25 - like to know how they work
09:27 - also don't forget to check out the
09:28 - ultimate gamedev course in the
09:29 - description
09:30 - it's only running for 30 days so check
09:32 - it out and turn gamedev into your dream
09:34 - job
09:34 - alright hope that's useful check out
09:36 - these videos to learn some more
09:38 - thanks to these awesome patreon
09:39 - supporters for making these videos
09:40 - possible
09:41 - thank you for watching and i'll see you
09:43 - next time
09:51 - you
