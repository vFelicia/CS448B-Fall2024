00:00 - hello and welcome I am your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're continuing to
00:03 - make the Demoman from Team Fortress 2 in
00:05 - unity we're going to create the island
00:08 - it's a melee weapon that grants a speed
00:10 - bonus for each enemy killed let's get
00:13 - started
00:16 - ok so I have my demo man here holding
00:20 - the Islander with item and want
00:22 - animations let's go into our code and
00:25 - set up our melee attack so I have the
00:29 - code here from the previous videos where
00:31 - we first implemented the bounty grenade
00:34 - then the sticky grenade then we added
00:36 - the ability to reload our weapons so the
00:40 - first thing we're gonna do is clean up
00:41 - our code and put the grenade code in its
00:44 - separate function so grab all this code
00:47 - here the space to switch weapon test the
00:49 - animation to shoot test the reload
00:51 - explore grenades all of this let's copy
00:54 - it into a different method and call it
00:57 - handle grenade input now in here we
01:00 - don't want to call this for now since
01:02 - we're dealing with the melee system so
01:04 - let's go in here and make a private void
01:07 - handle manly input and we're gonna call
01:11 - it in here ok now in here let's test for
01:16 - input not get mouse button down of mouse
01:20 - button 0 so the left mouse button and I
01:22 - added some functions to the player
01:24 - interface of the previous video here
01:27 - they are I've got a function to get the
01:29 - position of my player play in animation
01:32 - for the island attack with a target
01:34 - position and set a move speed bonus
01:36 - which will add later
01:37 - so using these three functions I have
01:39 - everything necessary to implement the
01:41 - island or melee system okay so in here
01:44 - when we got the mouse button down let's
01:45 - first grab the mouse world position and
01:48 - in here I'm going to go into the player
01:50 - interface and play the animation I'll
01:52 - enter attack towards my target position
01:54 - so when we play the animation we want to
01:56 - actually damage enemy so let's go down
01:58 - here into our grenade exploded code and
02:01 - put this in its own separate function so
02:04 - copy all this and export into a
02:06 - different function and call it damage
02:09 - enemies in range and this will also
02:12 - receive a quote for the damage range
02:15 - which we're going to send it in here so
02:19 - in here let's put a blast radius of 25
02:22 - and feed it to that function okay so we
02:24 - have this function that is now damaging
02:26 - enemies within range of that position we
02:29 - are calling that
02:30 - Renea they explode as previously but
02:33 - we're also going to call this on our
02:35 - mailing attacks so in here damage the
02:38 - enemies in range within range of the
02:40 - lair position player Doug at position
02:43 - and the damage range it's going to be
02:46 - similar so let's say 20 M and let's also
02:49 - add some camera shake
02:51 - going into the utils class to call it
02:53 - shake camera intensity of one timer 0.1
02:57 - m as always you can grab the code monkey
02:59 - utilities from unity code monkey calm
03:01 - okay so this should be working we're
03:03 - testing for our left mouse button down
03:05 - if it is down we're going to play the
03:07 - Islander attack animation towards our
03:09 - target position then we're going to
03:12 - damage all enemies within 20 units of
03:14 - the player position and finally shake
03:17 - the camera so let's go to our scene test
03:19 - it out and see if that behavior is
03:21 - correctly working okay here's my demo
03:24 - man I can move around
03:25 - I can hit nothing and when I hit close
03:28 - to an enemy there he goes he's going
03:30 - going boom like that okay great
03:34 - so we have our manly attack working
03:37 - perfectly okay so now that we have the
03:41 - normal melee attack working let's add an
03:44 - effect to increase our bonus movement
03:46 - speed per enemy kill going to go into
03:49 - our scripts and create a new C sharp
03:51 - script name it I and Lander this won't
03:54 - be the class that will be responsible
03:55 - for handling all the bonus movement
03:57 - speed so in here you get rid of all of
04:00 - this doesn't actually have a model
04:03 - behavior just a pure simple class so in
04:06 - here let us make first a private const
04:09 - floats call it bonus speed for a kill
04:13 - and we're going to give it 10 F we're
04:17 - going to have a private static int bonus
04:21 - amount which will start off at 0 then
04:24 - we're going to have some functions to
04:25 - interface with this class so let's make
04:27 - a public static void add speed bonus in
04:32 - here we're simply going to increase the
04:34 - bonus amount we're going to have a
04:36 - public static void reset
04:40 - the bonus which will set the bonus
04:43 - amount back to zero and finally a public
04:46 - static quote get speed bonus which will
04:50 - return the bonus speed for a kill
04:53 - multiplied by our bonus amount okay so
04:56 - whenever we kill an enemy we want to
04:58 - call this function which will increase
04:59 - our bonus amount and then we want to get
05:02 - the speed bonus which will then be
05:03 - applied to our player handler whenever
05:05 - we get hit we want to reset the speed
05:07 - bonus and then apply the same so back to
05:10 - my game hammer script in here on my
05:12 - melee input when I damage enemies in
05:15 - range
05:16 - first of all let's modify this function
05:18 - to get a return value for how many
05:20 - enemies were killed
05:21 - so I need to return from void and make
05:25 - it return an int and in here and in for
05:29 - enemies killed amount and this is what
05:33 - we're going to return from this function
05:35 - and here when we do kill one we're going
05:38 - to increase that function okay so now
05:40 - here in enemies killed amount will be
05:44 - that and first of all we're only going
05:46 - to shake our camera if the enemies have
05:49 - been killed so if enemies killed if it
05:51 - is bigger than 0 then shake our camera
05:53 - and add it to our island or bonus so
05:56 - island or not add speed bonus we're
05:58 - going to add just one bonus regardless
06:00 - of how many enemies we kill so the
06:02 - effect isn't insanely drastic and
06:04 - finally in here we're going to go into
06:06 - our player interface which has a
06:10 - function for set the move speed bonus
06:12 - and it takes in a float for the move
06:14 - speed that won't be added on to its
06:16 - normal move speed so what we want linear
06:18 - is go into our Islander and get our
06:21 - speed bonus okay so this way if we have
06:24 - killed more than zero enemies so if at
06:26 - least one enemy has been killed we're
06:28 - going to shake our camera add the speed
06:30 - bonus to our Islander class and then set
06:32 - the player interface move speed bonus
06:34 - based on what the Islander class says so
06:36 - let's go to our scene and test it out we
06:39 - should be increasing our speed for each
06:41 - enemy we kill okay here I am there's an
06:45 - enemy and then BOOM and yep I am moving
06:48 - a bit faster and a bit more bit more
06:51 - bit more okay so as you can see the code
07:03 - is working perfectly I am increasing my
07:05 - move speed for each enemy kimba as you
07:08 - can see it looks quite a bit silly when
07:10 - reaches insane levels so we obviously
07:13 - want to cap our bonus move speed amount
07:16 - into a decent normal Valley okay so
07:21 - let's go into our Islander class and add
07:24 - a private constant load for our bonus
07:28 - amount max which we're going to set
07:31 - let's say fine so in here we're only
07:36 - going to increase our bonus amount if
07:38 - the bonus amount is indeed less than the
07:41 - maximum and just for testing what's
07:44 - going to using the code monkey utilities
07:49 - go into the CM debug class to do a X pop
07:53 - up to say our bonus amount so we can
07:55 - easily see if it stays within the valid
07:57 - ranges okay let's try it out okay here I
08:01 - am I can move I can attack there's an
08:03 - enemy and boom bonus amount one two
08:06 - three four five and five yep it is
08:10 - capped at five okay there you go
08:14 - it is moving obviously much faster but
08:16 - still within a valley valley okay great
08:21 - so now let's lose the bonus when we get
08:24 - hit by an enemy now down here on my
08:27 - player interface I have had an event
08:29 - event handler on hit that is called
08:31 - whenever the player is hit by an enemy
08:33 - so let's use that to reset our speed
08:36 - bones thing to go up here and go into my
08:39 - player interface and subscribe to the on
08:41 - hit event so in here all we need to do
08:44 - is go into our Islander and reset our
08:47 - speed bonus and then obviously apply it
08:50 - to our player interface and for testing
08:53 - let's add a text pop-up on the player
08:58 - interface dot get position and just say
09:01 - hit okay so now when the player is hit
09:04 - this
09:05 - don't be fired this function won't
09:06 - capture this event it won't reset the
09:08 - movement speed bonus it won't give the
09:10 - player interface the new reset speed
09:13 - bonus and it will make a simple pop up
09:15 - so we can see when the event has been
09:16 - fired so let's go and test it out okay
09:21 - here I am there's an enemy I'm going to
09:22 - kill okay what is amount one two three
09:26 - four five okay the bonus amount has been
09:29 - correctly capped now let me get hit by
09:33 - an enemy and see if it resets boom there
09:36 - we go reset down to zero now I'm being
09:37 - hit kill them all and now I can increase
09:40 - again let me get hit and there you get
09:44 - movement speed is back to normal
09:46 - hit it and now fast yep okay great so
09:53 - there you have it we added the island
09:55 - there as a melee weapon and applied a
09:57 - bonus to our movement speed when enemy
09:59 - is killed we also made sure to reset our
10:02 - bonus movement speed whenever we get hit
10:04 - by an enemy in the next video we're
10:06 - going to cover the charge ability as
10:08 - always you can download the project
10:10 - files and you Tonys for free from the MV
10:13 - code monkey comp if you have any
10:15 - questions post them in the comments and
10:16 - I'll do my best to answer them ok see
10:18 - you next time
