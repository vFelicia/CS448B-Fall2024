00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - super quick video just to tell you about
00:03 - something really cool Unity recently
00:05 - published a really awesome Shader sample
00:07 - set this is really generally great
00:09 - you've got 30 shaders examples for all
00:11 - kinds of effects for example there's one
00:13 - on how to do an angle mask so a common
00:15 - use case is to play something like snow
00:16 - only on the top side or how to make some
00:18 - really smooth noise in a very efficient
00:20 - manner you can learn how to dynamically
00:22 - generate some hexagons or some bricks
00:24 - you can learn how to use parallx in
00:25 - order to give depth to your materials or
00:27 - learn how to make some cell shaded
00:29 - lighting how to make some nice SM
00:30 - particles or how to do some really
00:32 - interesting really awesome interior
00:34 - mapping Shader all of these effects all
00:36 - of these are made in shadh so you can
00:38 - easily inspect to see how it all works
00:40 - and all the graphs have all excellent
00:41 - notes explaining exactly how all of it
00:43 - works I really love how all of this is
00:45 - explained and how this whole scene is
00:46 - set up you can just walk around this
00:48 - scene and learn about various features
00:50 - see how they look and learn how it all
00:52 - works under the hood now for me
00:53 - personally I am not a graphics or Shader
00:55 - expert so I've already learned a few
00:56 - things by going through this simple
00:58 - Shader graph really is a Tru magical
01:00 - tool if you learn how to use it properly
01:01 - you become capable of building so much
01:03 - awesome stuff this is a really awesome
01:05 - sample I'm very impressed with it I
01:06 - definitely do hope they do more of these
01:08 - samples in the future for all kinds of
01:10 - tools not just Shader graph Unity does
01:12 - listen to feedback so if you appreciate
01:14 - these awesome free samples definitely
01:15 - make your voice heard in forums in order
01:17 - to install this sample open up a project
01:19 - with unity version 22 LTS or Unity 6
01:21 - then open up the package manager find
01:23 - the Shad graph package click on the
01:26 - samples Tab and install the feature
01:27 - examples now if you don't see feature
01:30 - examples if you don't see this then make
01:31 - sure you have the latest 22 LTS version
01:34 - for example right now over here I am
01:35 - using
01:37 - 22324 or make sure you're using the
01:39 - latest un6 version then inside you can
01:41 - just go inside the folders inside the
01:43 - scene folder and here you've got three
01:45 - different scenes for the three different
01:46 - random pipelines so in my case I'm using
01:48 - urp so I can just open up this one and
01:51 - yep here it is so again here are all the
01:53 - examples all of them perfectly annotated
01:55 - now they are split into 10 categories so
01:57 - there's one showing how to do all kinds
01:59 - of blending masks there's one for how to
02:01 - do custom interpolation one for how to
02:04 - do detail mapping how to do procedural
02:06 - patterns how to do UV projection how to
02:09 - do some more UV projection how to do
02:11 - vertex animation how to hand on
02:13 - particles use conditions to make
02:15 - branches and how to do some custom
02:17 - lighting this project also has this
02:19 - really nice custom editor window you can
02:21 - see over here on the drop- down menu all
02:23 - of the various samples and you can
02:25 - select any of them and it automatically
02:26 - moves the camera to that object so for
02:28 - example let's begin by expecting one of
02:30 - the simplest ones so for example over
02:33 - here is the animated flag one this one
02:35 - use a Shader in order to make this
02:36 - little wind animation on this flag so we
02:39 - can first of all read this nice tutorial
02:40 - to see how it works so this example
02:42 - shows a simple method for making a flag
02:44 - that ripples in the wind and the effect
02:46 - really centers around the sign note
02:48 - which is what creates a Rippling motion
02:49 - so on the examples I have a nice little
02:51 - mini tutorial over here and then we can
02:53 - inspect the Shad itself so there's a
02:55 - nice button open the example Shader and
02:57 - Y here it is here is the animated flag
02:59 - Shader again and all of it beautifully
03:01 - ranged all of it looking really nice
03:02 - really neat also including a bunch of
03:04 - groups and a bunch of comments by the
03:06 - way if you know nothing about Shader
03:08 - graph you can watch my Basics video on
03:09 - it essentially this is a tool that lets
03:11 - you create shaders by using visual nodes
03:13 - instead of having to write code so the
03:15 - way this animated flag works is
03:16 - basically by taking the position of the
03:18 - object then the split node which takes
03:21 - the output position so this is a vector
03:23 - 3 takes it and just grabs the r and the
03:25 - g which in this case it really means the
03:26 - X and the Y it keeps those Statics and
03:28 - really only modifi is the Zen and the
03:30 - way it modifies that one is over here
03:32 - like it says using the sine wave so this
03:34 - is something that's constantly bouncing
03:35 - between 0o and one so using that and
03:37 - using a flag movement mask in order to
03:39 - make sure that it doesn't actually move
03:41 - the part that is connected to the flag
03:43 - pole it only moves the part that is
03:44 - further away so it use that mask use the
03:47 - sine wave recones the normals puts it
03:49 - all in the position and yep in the final
03:50 - result the flag does wave with wind or
03:52 - you can learn how to make an angle mask
03:54 - so this one like it says here the angle
03:56 - mask uses direction that a surface is
03:58 - facing in order to determine if The Mask
04:00 - should be black or white if it is
04:01 - pointing in direction of the given input
04:03 - Vector then the mask is white if it's
04:05 - pointing away the mask is black and
04:06 - using that in some multiplication with a
04:08 - texture this how you can have this so
04:10 - basically if we rotate this object then
04:11 - no matter what is the orientation the
04:13 - snow is always just on top then there's
04:15 - this one about UV interpolation I did
04:17 - not notice but apparently tiling and
04:18 - offsetting UVS can become quite costly
04:21 - especially when scrolling UVS on a
04:22 - fairly large object so apparently if you
04:24 - need to do some kind of scrolling to do
04:26 - some kind of interesting animations if
04:27 - so instead of using the usual telling in
04:29 - offset node instead of that apparently
04:31 - you can scroll them in the vertex stage
04:33 - and doing so the visual result is
04:34 - literally exactly the same so by
04:36 - toggling and untl this checkbox I
04:38 - literally see no difference but
04:39 - apparently if you untoggle it if you do
04:41 - it in the vertex stage Apparently that
04:42 - is much more efficient we learn how to
04:44 - do parallx mapping these are basically
04:46 - many techniques that attempt to add more
04:48 - detail to the shape of a surface than
04:49 - it's actually represented in the
04:50 - geometry on the surface so basically
04:52 - this one over here this is just a flat
04:54 - Cube so there's no actual geometry over
04:56 - there giving depth but if we look at it
04:58 - from the angle we can see it does look
04:59 - like it has some depth again this is all
05:01 - just shaded trickery so it makes it
05:03 - super fast this one also has three
05:05 - techniques so we can actually just go
05:07 - into the inspector and select use the
05:09 - normal only and yep that's what it looks
05:11 - like use parallx or use parallx
05:14 - occlusion so modifying all of those and
05:16 - yep they yield different results or the
05:18 - really complex effect that everyone
05:19 - always loves interior Cube mapping this
05:21 - is the one that was Wily used in the
05:23 - game Spider-Man and people thought that
05:24 - it was pretty much magic this is a
05:26 - really awesome way to add some depths to
05:28 - your models again with without including
05:30 - any custom geometry so look at how all
05:32 - those buildings all those rooms they
05:34 - look like they have actual geometry
05:36 - however in reality they don't this is
05:37 - really just a really nice Shader trick
05:39 - and of course if you want to learn just
05:40 - open up the example Shader so here it is
05:42 - a lot of things so something with
05:44 - exteriors Interiors talking about
05:46 - interior Cube mapping using a for now
05:48 - and so on and there's another Shad graph
05:50 - over here inside so double click any up
05:52 - here is a really complex Shader doing
05:54 - all kinds of things now really don't ask
05:56 - me to explain this like I said I am not
05:58 - a Shader expert so I would really need
06:00 - to spend some time inspecting this
06:01 - sample taking it all apart one by one
06:04 - piece by piece in order to really
06:05 - understand how all of this works which
06:07 - is exactly what you can do by yourself
06:08 - if you want to learn how to build
06:10 - something like this then the Shad graph
06:11 - is essentially the source code so you
06:13 - can just browse through this and learn
06:15 - how it all works so definitely go ahead
06:16 - and download this awesome free sample to
06:18 - learn how all of these awesome effects
06:20 - work and like I said Unity does listen
06:22 - to feedback I know some people don't
06:23 - think that's the case and in terms of
06:25 - leadership then yeah sometimes that
06:27 - might be the case especially before but
06:29 - I do know that the people that work on
06:30 - these samples and tools these people
06:32 - really do listen to your feedback so if
06:34 - you want them to do more samples kind of
06:35 - like this one definitely go ahead and
06:36 - tell them in forms then go download the
06:38 - sample and learn how all of it works
06:40 - also just another quick mention on this
06:41 - video I'm currently editing the free C
06:44 - intermediate course video stay tuned for
06:45 - that one coming out on Monday all right
06:47 - hope that's useful check out these
06:49 - videos to learn some more thanks to
06:51 - these awesome patreon supporters for
06:52 - making these videos possible thank you
06:54 - for watching and I'll see you next time
