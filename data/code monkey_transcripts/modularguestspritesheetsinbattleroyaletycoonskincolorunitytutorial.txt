00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - in this video we're continuing to create
00:03 - modular spreadsheets as used in battle
00:05 - round tycoon we're going to further
00:06 - increase the randomization of our
00:08 - characters by adding skin color let's
00:10 - begin
00:13 - so here is our dynamically created
00:15 - spreadsheet we first have a base then we
00:18 - add a body on top of it and on top of
00:21 - that we have our head the head itself is
00:23 - composed of a base head plus a random
00:26 - hairstyle any random beard the hair and
00:28 - beard are tinted in various colors so we
00:31 - can have any of our air sounds in any
00:33 - color we want
00:34 - now we're going to do something similar
00:35 - to apply a skin color
00:37 - the game is up now on Steam so check it
00:39 - out to see what I'm teaching here apply
00:41 - to a real game so here in my textures
00:43 - this is the head we've been using which
00:44 - already had a skin color but now we're
00:46 - going to be using this one which again
00:48 - just like the hair it is simply in white
00:50 - and we're going to tint it using a skin
00:52 - color and again always remember that you
00:55 - need to set your textures to in a won't
00:57 - read and write so we can use them
00:58 - through code ok so let's go into the
01:00 - code in here let's go to our texture
01:03 - code and here we are grabbing the head
01:05 - pixels so here let's try doing the same
01:08 - thing that we did for the hair so first
01:10 - define a color for the skin color and
01:14 - then we do the same thing using our tint
01:17 - color array function and we're going to
01:20 - tint our head pixels using our skin
01:22 - color
01:23 - okay so let's set and see what happens
01:25 - and you blurred is the skin color is
01:27 - correctly being applied to our base
01:28 - texture however one issue you can see is
01:31 - the color of the eyes we want to tint
01:34 - the skin but not the eyes so let's go
01:36 - into the code and here we're going to
01:38 - solve this by creating a skin color mask
01:40 - essentially we're only going to tint on
01:42 - where the mask is and we're going to
01:44 - leave intented on the places where there
01:46 - are no masks here is the texture for the
01:49 - skin mask as you can see it has
01:51 - everything except for the eyes and
01:53 - that's what we're going to apply on top
01:55 - of our head so we need a function to
01:57 - tint but only inside a mask so let's go
01:59 - down here and make another function a
02:01 - private void and let's call this tint
02:04 - color arrays inside mask we're going to
02:08 - receive a color ray for our base array
02:11 - then a color for our tent and finally an
02:15 - array of colors for our masks so in here
02:18 - again we're going to cycle through every
02:20 - pixel in our base array and if
02:24 - the mask on that index dot alpha if the
02:28 - alpha is bigger than zero then we're
02:31 - going to apply the tent if the alpha is
02:34 - zero then we are not going to apply the
02:35 - tent around and we're going to leave the
02:37 - base array exactly as it is so in order
02:39 - to apply the tint
02:40 - we want to interpolate it between the
02:42 - base array and the ten color based on
02:44 - the mask alpha so let's get a color for
02:47 - our base color which is our base array
02:49 - on this index then we have a color for
02:52 - our fully tinted color which is our ten
02:56 - multiplied by the base color then we
03:00 - have a float for our interpolate amount
03:02 - which will be the mask alpha happy so in
03:06 - here we're going to the same thing that
03:07 - we were doing in here when we merge the
03:09 - color arrays so we take the base array
03:12 - on this index let's grab the red pixel
03:16 - and we increase it by the difference
03:18 - between the fully tinted color minus our
03:21 - base color and we multiply it by our
03:25 - interpolate amount okay so that's it
03:29 - apply everything to the other colors so
03:31 - the red the green and the blue okay so
03:35 - we now have a function that applies a
03:37 - tint but only on a certain area so now
03:39 - we can use this mass here which again
03:41 - doesn't have anything on the eyes so
03:43 - that one has an alpha of zero so that
03:46 - one won't leave the original head
03:48 - exactly with the same color so let's
03:50 - make AC release field in order to grab
03:52 - that texture so this is the base had
03:55 - mask texture and in here when we grab
03:59 - our head pixels we get the skin color
04:01 - and now we do tint color inside mask we
04:05 - grab the head pixels tinted with skin
04:07 - color inside the head skin mask pixels
04:11 - which we're going to grab them from our
04:14 - base head mask texture okay so let's see
04:17 - if our head is correctly being applied
04:19 - with a skin color but leaving the eyes
04:21 - and white and yep there it is as you can
04:23 - see the skin color has been applied but
04:25 - the eyes remain in white so now that we
04:28 - have that working let's apply various
04:30 - skin colors
04:34 - so just like with the hair we have
04:36 - defined an array of skin colors and we
04:39 - are picking a random one from that array
04:41 - which again then is applied to the head
04:42 - pixels inside the head skin mask now
04:45 - here we have random hair and random
04:47 - beard okay so let's see and yep there it
04:49 - is as you can see the final face being
04:51 - constructed from a base face tinted with
04:54 - a skin color then applied a hair and a
04:56 - beard so there's various skin colors and
04:59 - the eyes look perfectly fine so now one
05:01 - last thing we can do is add skin to the
05:03 - hands so far we've been using these
05:05 - gloves but now that we can tint the skin
05:07 - we can do the exact same thing for the
05:09 - hands so here is the hand sprite we're
05:11 - going to do the exact same thing first
05:13 - grab the hand texture we grab the hand
05:17 - pixels from our hands texture then we
05:21 - don't need to use a mask since the hand
05:22 - won't be completely tinted so we can use
05:24 - the same one we've used for the hair
05:26 - color we're going to tent our hand
05:28 - pixels using the same skin color as
05:30 - previously and then finally we add the
05:32 - hand into our main texture and yep
05:37 - Learner's we now have our final sprite
05:39 - sheet with a random skin color that is
05:41 - applied both to the face and to the hand
05:43 - so that with random bodies random hair
05:46 - and random beer nor with collars for
05:48 - everything and you can see that we now
05:49 - have a nearly infinite number of
05:51 - possibilities the game is up now on
05:53 - Steam so check it out to see what I'm
05:55 - teaching here apply to a real game so
05:57 - there you have it we took our previous
05:58 - sprite sheet and apply the skin colors
06:00 - to the face and the hands in the next
06:02 - video we're going to create body sprites
06:03 - with primary and secondary colors as
06:06 - long as you can download the project
06:07 - files in utilities from unity code
06:08 - monkey comm if you have any questions
06:10 - post them in the comments and I'll do my
06:12 - best answer them
06:13 - subscribe for more videos and I'll see
06:14 - you next time
