01:56 - trackers these are really cool would be
01:59 - great for all kinds of use case right

02:07 - down action game it has 24 effects with
02:09 - lots of shapes and colors to represent

03:09 - check out this horror prison it looks
03:11 - extremely creepy if you're interested in

04:48 - your own next for a fun visual effect
04:50 - check out this world scan it starts a
04:52 - scan running outwardly from a point it
04:55 - expands and attaches to any geometry it
04:57 - also includes some scripts in order to
04:58 - highlight some objects so it identifies
05:00 - if the scan has touched those objects
05:02 - and if so it shows their distance so
05:04 - this could be great for some kind of
05:05 - detective mode in your game some kind of
05:07 - radar scan to find all kinds of enemies
05:09 - and objects then if you're making a 3D
05:11 - platformer and you need a level check
