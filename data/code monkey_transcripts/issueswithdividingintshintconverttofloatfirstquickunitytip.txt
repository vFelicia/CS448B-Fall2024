00:01 - hi there this is a quick tip regarding
00:04 - the side effects of type conversions it
00:06 - is very important to be familiar with
00:08 - the various data types and what implicit
00:10 - limitations they have now one issue
00:12 - which has tripped me up a couple of
00:14 - times is you to doing math with integers
00:16 - so I'd say I have a simple health system
00:19 - in here where I have my current health
00:20 - and my maximum huh
00:22 - both of these are defined as int now in
00:25 - order to display my health in a health
00:27 - bar I would like to have a function that
00:29 - returns the health as a percentage some
00:31 - value between zero and one so we can
00:33 - easily apply it to a bar so for that we
00:36 - can go in here make a private float
00:38 - Comet get help
00:39 - percentage in order to get a percentage
00:44 - since we have the current amount and the
00:46 - maximum amount all we need is to return
00:47 - the health bound and divided by the
00:50 - health amount max so if we have a health
00:53 - Mad Max of a hundred and a half month of
00:55 - thirty then we should get point three so
00:58 - let's do a test make here a private void
01:01 - start and since we start off with a
01:04 - hundred health let's cause 70 health of
01:07 - damage and then do a debug dot log of
01:11 - what we get from the get health
01:12 - percentage okay so starting with a
01:15 - hundred taking 70 we should get point
01:17 - three so let's see and here is the log
01:20 - and as you can see it is incorrect it is
01:22 - saying zero instead of zero point three
01:24 - now the issue here is you to the fact
01:27 - that if I'm doing math with two integers
01:30 - the result won't also be an int so since
01:33 - zero point three cannot be represented
01:34 - with an int it gets cast down to just
01:37 - zero so what we need here is do math
01:40 - using floats now when we can do it is
01:43 - cast one of these values to a float just
01:45 - like this and now we're going to have a
01:48 - float divided by an int so the result
01:51 - will be a float so we can run this code
01:53 - again and there it is the console now
01:56 - correctly says zero point three so
01:59 - always remember to be careful when doing
02:01 - math with integers and that's it hope
02:04 - you found this tip useful alright see
02:06 - you next time
