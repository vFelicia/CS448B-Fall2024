00:00 - here's a quick entity tip so here is my
00:02 - player character and i have some simple
00:04 - movement implemented
00:05 - now as i move left and right or up and
00:07 - down i have this speed
00:09 - but if i move in any diagonal then the
00:11 - character is now suddenly going faster
00:13 - that is not supposed to happen movement
00:15 - should be at a constant speed in any
00:17 - direction
00:18 - here is the code which just grabs the
00:19 - inputs and creates the movement vector
00:22 - the issue is with regards to the vector
00:24 - magnitude if you just move in one
00:25 - direction then the magnitude is 1 which
00:27 - is correct
00:28 - but if you move in two directions at
00:30 - once then the magnitude is more than one
00:32 - which makes it move faster
00:34 - the solution is simple whenever you have
00:36 - movement vectors
00:37 - always make sure to normalize those
00:38 - vectors normalizing means it will keep
00:41 - the same direction but set the magnitude
00:42 - to 1.
00:43 - so now i can move in any direction and
00:45 - movement is always at constant speed
00:47 - exactly as it should be ok subscribe for
