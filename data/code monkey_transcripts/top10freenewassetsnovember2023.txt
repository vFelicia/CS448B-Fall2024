00:43 - realistic car controller a really nice
00:45 - FPS controllers some magic and so on and
00:48 - there's also some cinti assets although
00:50 - if you're specifically looking for cinti
00:51 - assets they also got a Black Friday sale
00:52 - in their store bunch of stuff at 70% off
00:55 - and all of the usual gorgeous ones these
00:56 - are only at 50% off like the fantasy
00:59 - Kingdom this is the one that was shown
01:00 - in the unite keynote if you'd like to
01:02 - try to build something that is just as
01:04 - good looking as that then maybe pick
01:05 - this up and try it out and over on
01:06 - Humble Bundle there's a bundle with a
01:08 - ton of blender modeling 3D courses I'm
01:11 - pretty sure this is the one that I went
01:12 - through and really taught me the basics
01:13 - of blender I managed to learn quite a
01:15 - lot Grant is a great teacher so if you
01:17 - need anything now is the best time to
01:18 - get it so check out all the sales with
01:20 - the links in the description all right
01:21 - so on to the top 10 list starting off
01:23 - with an official new Unity asset called
01:25 - quiz you this is a fully working quiz
01:27 - mini game and importantly this is all
01:29 - made with UI toolkit now if you don't
01:31 - know UI toolkit is the new UI system
01:33 - that un has been working on for quite
01:35 - some time I've done a bunch of research
01:36 - on it but I haven't yet had the time to
01:38 - make a full tutorial on it just yet it's
01:40 - very interesting compared to the regular
01:42 - uny it has some nice Pros in terms of
01:44 - separating data from the visuals this
01:46 - asset looks like an excellent learning
01:47 - sample if you want to start learning UI
01:49 - tokit it is meant to teach you various
01:51 - things like event dispatch and
01:52 - propagation State pattern for game Flow
01:54 - managing menus and the model view
01:56 - presenter pattern personally I will
01:58 - certainly be diving deep into this
02:00 - sample once I find the time to research
02:01 - some UI toen then if you've been playing
02:03 - Super Mario wonder and you're inspired
02:05 - to build something like it then here's a
02:07 - pack with some visuals that could be
02:08 - taken straight from that game it's got
02:10 - some very nice soft colors some nice
02:12 - round edges everything looks really
02:14 - inviting it includes a bunch of modular
02:16 - pieces for some grass some path you've
02:18 - got trees houses air blocks and a bunch
02:20 - more so just with this one pack you
02:22 - could build an entire Mario inspired
02:24 - game with lots of unique levels and
02:26 - biomes next here's an interesting tool
02:28 - that adds a bunch of useful cont text
02:30 - actions as you Mouse over a folder you
02:32 - can see a tiny icon that lets you create
02:34 - a subfolder and you can automatically
02:35 - give it some preset names you can also
02:37 - automatically create a script from
02:39 - various templates so automatically write
02:41 - the baller plates for an interface a
02:43 - struct in N code or a bunch more you can
02:45 - create and set up shaders with just one
02:47 - click and a bunch more options this is a
02:49 - tiny tool but when working on a large
02:51 - project these tiny actions do end up
02:53 - taking quite a decent check of time so
02:55 - this can be quite useful then if you're
02:56 - looking for some Trails visuals here's a
02:58 - free pack with some really nice variety
03:01 - these all look really good very nice and
03:03 - Wiggly it's honestly really high quality
03:04 - for a free pack these are all made with
03:06 - the VFX graph so they are super high
03:08 - quality it includes 10 unique Trails so
03:10 - things like fire ice there's one for
03:13 - Cosmos void water and a bunch more and
03:15 - this pack also includes sound effects
03:16 - really nice next if you'd like to
03:18 - prototype a city Builder game then check
03:20 - out this pack you've got six really nice
03:22 - buildings all in a low poly style but
03:24 - still with a nice amount of detail
03:25 - there's a fire station Hospital workshop
03:27 - and a bunch more visually I think they
03:29 - all look really great so basically if
03:31 - you grab this pack and then you grab my
03:32 - free grade building system if you put
03:34 - those two together it can make a really
03:36 - nice city Builder prototype in just a
03:37 - few minutes then if you combine that
03:39 - with a free character pack for some
03:41 - pedestrians and a free car pack for some
03:43 - Vehicles put all that together and you
03:44 - have everything needed to make a really
03:46 - nice city build there all completely for
03:47 - free then here's an interesting tool for
03:49 - running typescript alongside your C code
03:52 - personally I'm not a JavaScript expert I
03:54 - only know the absolute Basics the main
03:56 - benefit of something like typescript
03:57 - versus vanilla JavaScript is obviously
03:59 - used using types again for me as someone
04:01 - who does most of my programming in c
04:03 - every time I write some JavaScript it
04:05 - drives me crazy how there's no types so
04:07 - I'm definitely a fan of typescript at
04:09 - least the concept behind it this is a
04:11 - apparently especially great if you're
04:12 - making webgl games or apps and of course
04:14 - since it's JavaScript that means you
04:16 - have access to npm to download the
04:18 - millions of JavaScript libraries that do
04:20 - really anything you can think of next
04:22 - for some visuals here's one that looks
04:24 - really great these screenshots look
04:25 - really nice both because the assets and
04:27 - also the en lighting and post-processing
04:29 - that to use it looks really calm really
04:31 - inviting looking at this one I would say
04:33 - this is obviously perfect for some kind
04:34 - of Sims game you could combine this with
04:36 - my grid system and get something really
04:38 - nice just pick up a free Character Pack
04:40 - add some interactions and you have a
04:42 - really nice Sims game then for a
04:43 - potentially very useful tool here we
04:45 - have value Observer like the name
04:47 - implies this one lets you observe when a
04:48 - value changes so you can use this custom
04:51 - class with whatever other type you want
04:53 - then when you modify the underlying
04:54 - value you can get notified that
04:56 - something changed this is something that
04:57 - I do all the time in my own code I
04:59 - modify my variables through functions
05:01 - instead of direct access I do that
05:03 - specifically so I can fire events if
05:04 - needed and this tool basically does all
05:06 - that without having to write a ton of
05:08 - code for yourself you just use this
05:09 - class and everything works it's a really
05:11 - nice and simple way to save you a little
05:13 - bit of time or perhaps as a research
05:15 - tool just to see how something very
05:16 - useful like this can be built then
05:18 - here's another interesting tool this one
05:20 - is for copying scriptable objects data
05:22 - this is definitely something that I've
05:23 - needed to do in the past and it was
05:25 - indeed very annoying to have to copy
05:27 - paste one by one this sybol to will help
05:28 - solve that you can copy some script ball
05:30 - object data and then select another or
05:32 - multiple other objects and simply paste
05:34 - that data importantly it has a nice
05:36 - window where you can pick what data you
05:38 - want to paste so you don't have to
05:39 - override all the fields only the ones
05:41 - that you want it's a simple tool and if
05:43 - you use script B objects a lot like you
05:45 - should do then this can really come in
05:46 - handy sometimes then if you need some
05:48 - nice free weapons check out this pack I
05:50 - quite like this style it's low poly but
05:52 - with some nice rounded edges the colors
05:54 - are solid meaning you can very easily
05:56 - recolor all the weapons to get tons of
05:57 - variation you've got multiple weapons
05:59 - both for shooting and for melee so if
06:01 - you need some weapons then this would be
06:02 - a great starting point all right so
06:04 - those are my top 10 free new assets on
06:06 - the UNS store for November 23 there's
