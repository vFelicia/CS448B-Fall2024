00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's handle some simple
00:03 - character customization this one is a
00:05 - topic that has been requested quite a
00:07 - few times and just a while ago i was
00:08 - browsing some assets and i found a pack
00:10 - that would be perfect to demonstrate the
00:12 - system in this video i want to cover the
00:14 - various methods from the simplest to the
00:15 - more complex showing you what fields you
00:17 - need to change and how there are
00:19 - actually quite a few tricky things with
00:21 - doing this especially with the funnel
00:22 - method so by watching this full video
00:24 - you will hopefully avoid the frustration
00:26 - that i went through when i researched
00:27 - this topic if this video helps you
00:29 - please hit the like button it really
00:30 - helps out this was actually quite a bit
00:32 - more complex than i was anticipating
00:34 - this topic is also pretty dependent on
00:36 - how your assets are set up so for this
00:38 - demo i picked up three characters with
00:40 - three different setups from three
00:41 - different asset packs so hopefully you
00:43 - can learn how to do this with whatever
00:45 - characters you have do you want to learn
00:47 - unity blender and programming patterns
00:50 - then check out my curator code monkey
00:51 - bundle with a link in the description
00:53 - this is a collaboration with gamedev tv
00:55 - all of their courses have the highest
00:56 - rating possible i got in touch with them
00:58 - to specifically select three courses to
01:00 - make a nice complete bundle to take you
01:02 - from beginner to advanced i chose their
01:04 - ultimate unity 3d course this one will
01:06 - teach you both unity and c-sharp both
01:08 - starring complete from scratch then the
01:10 - blender 3d modeling course i picked this
01:12 - one up myself a few months ago and i've
01:14 - learned a ton thanks to it and the final
01:16 - one is a more advanced really
01:17 - interesting programming course all about
01:19 - programming patterns
01:21 - it's excellent for helping you massively
01:22 - improve the quality of your code which
01:24 - in turn helps you make better games
01:25 - faster i chose all of these cores myself
01:27 - to really give you a nice path to go
01:29 - from beginner to advanced the bundle has
01:31 - a really nice discount so check it out
01:32 - with a link in the description okay so
01:34 - there are several ways to handle
01:36 - character customization the simplest
01:38 - possible is with these two methods first
01:40 - just change the material and texture
01:43 - this works for a basic reskin although a
01:45 - texture includes anything so it doesn't
01:47 - have to be just literally changing the
01:48 - skin color depending on how your
01:51 - character is set up you can change the
01:52 - color of the mountain armor or whatever
01:54 - else use the material that you're
01:56 - swapping the second simplest method is
01:58 - by changing the visual mesh this will
02:00 - change the entire physical shape of the
02:02 - character i actually covered just this
02:04 - method in detail in another video how
02:06 - you can easily swap meshes while keeping
02:08 - the same animations so with just these
02:10 - two methods you can already achieve
02:11 - quite a lot of customization variation
02:13 - and then building on top of those you
02:15 - have two more methods for adding parts
02:17 - to your characters you can add parts
02:19 - using mesh renders or you can add parts
02:22 - using skin mesh renders the skin match
02:24 - renders one is a tricky one it can be
02:26 - quite hard to understand why it's not
02:28 - working now in this video i'm focusing
02:30 - just on the basics for how all of these
02:31 - methods work just showing you what
02:33 - fields you need to change and where you
02:35 - need to spawn the objects i'm thinking i
02:37 - might do a second video after this one
02:38 - building upon these basics with an
02:40 - actual working system something to
02:42 - handle all the parts maybe include a
02:44 - safe load system ui buttons and so on
02:46 - let me know in the comments if you'd
02:47 - like to see that follow-up video but
02:48 - first let's start off simple so here is
02:51 - my demo for the essence like i said i
02:53 - found an excellent asset pack just for
02:54 - this topic it's the modular character
02:57 - pack by cinti studios
02:58 - and right now they're actually running a
03:00 - spring sale on their store everything is
03:02 - at half price including this pack this
03:04 - pack contains over 700 unique parts so
03:07 - with just this one pack you can create a
03:09 - near infinite amount of characters so
03:11 - definitely check out this pack with the
03:12 - film link in the description as well as
03:14 - everything else that is currently on
03:15 - sale on the cinti store this one is the
03:17 - last week of the sale everything is at
03:19 - half price and the western pack is at 70
03:21 - off if you're a fan of their style just
03:23 - like me you can find asset packs for
03:25 - whatever game you're currently working
03:26 - on so over here i have this character
03:28 - from that pack then i also have another
03:30 - character here this one is also by
03:32 - cynthia studios but this one is from
03:34 - another pack this one is from the
03:35 - battleground pack and finally i have
03:38 - over here another character this one is
03:39 - from the free unity star assets this one
03:42 - is a really awesome free asset with
03:44 - first and third person controllers made
03:45 - official by unity i cover them in detail
03:48 - in another video if you want to learn
03:49 - more
03:50 - and the reason why i picked up these
03:51 - three different characters is because
03:53 - making a character customization system
03:54 - is very much dependent on how your ads
03:56 - are set up so by showing it working with
03:59 - three different characters with three
04:00 - different setups you will hopefully
04:02 - learn how to apply to any characters you
04:03 - have
04:04 - over here on the first character this is
04:06 - the one from the modular characters pack
04:08 - the character is set up with multiple
04:10 - skin mesh renderers you basically have a
04:12 - different one for each body part so all
04:15 - the hair objects are all of them over
04:17 - here
04:17 - you can enable and disable them to swap
04:19 - them out then over here a bunch of face
04:21 - coverings
04:22 - there's a nice hat some other one and so
04:25 - on
04:25 - then for the various torsos all of them
04:28 - with different armor different things
04:30 - and finally the setup for this one
04:31 - inside the skeleton it also has a few
04:34 - pre-made objects for example here the
04:36 - hips attachment so a few objects that
04:37 - were pre-made to place all the extra
04:39 - parts there's a back attachment cape
04:42 - chest and so on so it has all of these
04:44 - extra objects then on the second
04:46 - character over here this one is from the
04:48 - battle royale pack this one is made up
04:50 - of a single skin mesh renderer so just a
04:53 - single one for the entire body just one
04:55 - material
04:56 - and then this content is all pre-sanded
04:58 - just has all the bones so no attachments
05:00 - and finally over here the character made
05:02 - by unity this one is also composed of a
05:04 - single skin mesh render although this
05:06 - one does have multiple materials
05:08 - and then also has a pre-regular skeleton
05:12 - okay so those are the three characters
05:13 - and the slight differences with how they
05:15 - are set up
05:16 - now like i said the first method is just
05:18 - swapping out textures one of the reasons
05:20 - why i love cinti assets is because their
05:22 - assets usually include multiple textures
05:24 - which you can easily swap
05:26 - so for example on this one on the
05:27 - modular characters pack
05:29 - this is the one that is set up with
05:30 - multiple skin mesh renders so on this
05:32 - one if i swap out the material so swap
05:35 - out for this one or this one and as you
05:36 - can see this one changes the skin color
05:38 - although again it depends on how the
05:40 - character is set up and with this one
05:42 - this one is set up of multiple skin mesh
05:44 - renders so that means that i don't need
05:46 - to change just one material i have to
05:48 - change them all so for example over here
05:49 - you can see the skin color is different
05:51 - in the face and the hand so i need to go
05:52 - back into the hands so i was for the
05:54 - other one and so on and yep now it is
05:56 - indeed in uniform so yep there you go
05:58 - with this you see some basic character
06:00 - customization just recoloring then on
06:02 - this other character also made by cindy
06:04 - studios this one is the one that has
06:06 - just a single skin mesh render and on
06:08 - this one recoloring it's also the same
06:10 - thing so once again it includes various
06:12 - meshes and i can just swap out the
06:14 - material and i get a different one with
06:17 - different visuals and finally on the
06:19 - last character made by unity it's the
06:21 - same thing just swamp out the material
06:22 - to change the color
06:24 - this one doesn't actually come with any
06:26 - prebuilt texture variations but you can
06:28 - just go into the main base textures and
06:30 - over here just draw over them and so on
06:32 - alright so that's the simplest method
06:34 - just swapping out the materials like i
06:36 - said in this video i'm focusing just on
06:37 - showing you what fields you would need
06:39 - to change so for this method you can
06:41 - easily make a script with a reference
06:42 - for a material and just swap out the
06:44 - skin mesh random material for the second
06:46 - method swapping out the mesh itself that
06:49 - one i actually already covered in detail
06:50 - in another video basically you need to
06:52 - swap out the mesh swap out the material
06:54 - change the skeleton and assign a new
06:56 - animator avatar i don't want this video
06:58 - to be too long so go watch that other
06:59 - one if you want to see how to do that
07:01 - and some common issues with that method
07:03 - and finally let's look at the more
07:04 - interesting part of a system like this
07:06 - adding things on top of your character
07:08 - so adding armor hair capes and so on
07:10 - in order to do this like i said you have
07:12 - two methods you can either use regular
07:15 - mesh renders or you can use skin mesh
07:17 - renders there are some pros and cons to
07:19 - both and again it also depends on how
07:20 - your assets are set up this character
07:23 - here from the modular pack has both
07:24 - those methods so let's see first using
07:27 - skin mesh renders the asset actually
07:29 - comes with a bunch of pre-made
07:30 - characters so all of these are pre-made
07:32 - using all the various components that
07:34 - are included and if we look at the
07:36 - character we can see that somewhere is
07:37 - set up in all of the various parts
07:39 - each of them over here is using a skin
07:41 - mesh runner and you can see it's using a
07:43 - different mesh and for the different
07:45 - parts they also got a different root
07:46 - bone maybe a different material and so
07:48 - on so in this case in order to do
07:50 - character customization with these ones
07:52 - you really just enable or disable game
07:54 - objects so just making a simple script
07:56 - talking out that one for that one and
07:57 - there you go it changes automatically
07:59 - this one is especially easy to do if all
08:01 - of the parts are already included in
08:02 - your prefab just like with this
08:04 - character so over here you could make a
08:06 - very simple script just to enable or
08:07 - disable all sequentially going through
08:09 - all the children and so on so this would
08:11 - be super easy to use
08:13 - so yeah if you're looking to make some
08:14 - character customization i can highly
08:16 - recommend this pack now of course there
08:18 - is a cost to having a character prefab
08:20 - with tons and tons of parts even if they
08:21 - are disabled game objects
08:23 - so if you go ahead with this method
08:25 - definitely make sure you only use all
08:27 - the parts in the character customization
08:29 - screen
08:30 - and then once the player has customized
08:31 - their character in the end then just do
08:34 - a recursive cycle through all of the
08:35 - various parts and just destroy all of
08:37 - the game objects that you're not using
08:39 - if i end up making that second video
08:41 - i'll definitely cover that process
08:43 - now let me cover the mesh render method
08:45 - before i talk about the common issues
08:46 - with skin mesh renders with the mesh
08:48 - render method it's actually super simple
08:50 - so as i said this character pack comes
08:52 - with both those methods
08:54 - and by the way if you want to know where
08:55 - all of these skin mesh renders exist
08:57 - well they're all inside the mesh so as
08:59 - you can see over here all of the various
09:01 - body parts on the built-in mesh so here
09:04 - is the modular character's mesh and has
09:06 - all these tons and tons of things so
09:08 - that's how you apply it using the skin
09:10 - mesh render method for the measuring
09:12 - method then you need objects with just
09:14 - the mesh render and for that this pack
09:16 - also has that so over here all of them
09:18 - as inch individual objects so each of
09:20 - those is a separate prefab for a
09:22 - separate part separate thing so over
09:24 - here a bunch of arms a bunch of eyebrows
09:27 - facial hair and so on now as to how you
09:30 - use a regular mesh render in
09:32 - customization it's also super simple
09:34 - what you need to do is find the bone
09:35 - where you want to attach the part so
09:37 - let's look over here into our skeleton
09:40 - and for example over here inside the
09:41 - bone inside the neck we've got the head
09:43 - and we've got a head attachment then
09:45 - just find the part that you want and
09:47 - simply drag it as a child of that bone
09:49 - and yep there you go that's really it as
09:51 - the bone moves along with the animation
09:53 - this object moves along with it now
09:55 - obviously again this will depend on how
09:56 - your assets are set up
09:58 - you might need to offset the assets by a
10:00 - little bit if so that's actually pretty
10:02 - easy to do like for example here this
10:04 - knee attachment let's say i want to use
10:06 - this as a mask if i simply drag it over
10:09 - here onto the head bone and if i do you
10:11 - can see it's not positioned correctly
10:13 - it's in there in this case you can
10:14 - either spawn it on top of the bone and
10:16 - then move it to where you want it or you
10:18 - can just make an empty game object make
10:21 - this one a child of it apply the offset
10:22 - to that child object and keep the parent
10:24 - exactly on zero zero on top of the bone
10:26 - then you would make this one into a
10:28 - prefab instead of that one and spawn
10:29 - this one instead of that one so if your
10:31 - assets come from different packs and
10:32 - they don't match up perfectly then you
10:34 - can use this simple trick just using a
10:36 - parent game object in order to position
10:38 - them exactly what you want
10:39 - and since this method is based on adding
10:41 - parts as children to some bones you
10:43 - might want to place them relative to
10:45 - some bone and not directly on top of the
10:46 - bone
10:47 - that is why on this character this one
10:49 - already comes with a bunch of attachment
10:51 - points but for example the one down here
10:53 - does not
10:54 - so if you've got a skeleton like this
10:56 - one and you want to create some attach
10:57 - points it's very simple it's literally
10:59 - just creating an empty game object then
11:01 - you position it wherever you want it so
11:03 - let's say over there for a face mask as
11:05 - you can see it's a child of the neck so
11:07 - it moves along with it
11:08 - and then you can just position that
11:10 - attach point to get it exactly as you
11:12 - want it so that's how you can use this
11:14 - method with any mesh in any skeleton
11:16 - okay so as you can see the mesh render
11:18 - method is super simple and works on
11:20 - anything you just find the bone or the
11:22 - attach point and just make the object
11:24 - the child of it that's it super simple
11:26 - so in order to make some kind of system
11:27 - using this method you would basically
11:29 - just prepare all of the various helmet
11:31 - prefabs
11:32 - get a reference for the neck or head
11:34 - bone or the helmet attachment point and
11:36 - just pretty much instantiate those acid
11:38 - parts it's really that simple however
11:40 - again going back when doing some
11:42 - customization with skin mesh renders
11:44 - actually quite a bit tricking
11:45 - and the reason for that is because skin
11:47 - mesh renders have one very sneaky thing
11:49 - that must be correctly set otherwise it
11:51 - won't work
11:52 - a while ago i suggest that you keep the
11:54 - mesh object as is
11:56 - so basically with all of the skin mesh
11:58 - renders for all the parts then when
12:00 - handling customization you just enable
12:02 - or disable the ones that you want and in
12:04 - the end you destroy the disabled ones
12:06 - however as soon as i said that you might
12:07 - have thought that you can just make some
12:09 - of these objects as prefabs and then
12:12 - instantiate them just like you would
12:13 - regular mesh renders so for example over
12:16 - here this helmet with a skin mesh render
12:18 - let's duplicate this get rid of the
12:20 - original one so still has a visual
12:23 - now let's drag this into the project to
12:24 - make a prefab and so far it sound works
12:27 - but now let's delete it from here and
12:29 - play the game
12:30 - and now let's say we had some code that
12:32 - would simply instantiate this prefab
12:33 - there you go drop it and right away you
12:35 - see the issue nope there is no visual
12:38 - now if you know about skin mesh renders
12:40 - you might assume that the issue is that
12:41 - the root bone over here is no longer
12:43 - signed
12:44 - so we can just go ahead and find the
12:45 - exact same bone that this one is using
12:46 - so this one is using the spine three so
12:48 - let's drag this reference and as soon as
12:50 - i drag the reference and nope still no
12:52 - visual so this is the really tricky
12:54 - thing about skin mesh renders it caused
12:56 - me quite a lot of frustration to figure
12:58 - this out if you look over here at the
13:00 - prefab and the non-prefab objects if i
13:02 - enable the non-prefab this one does have
13:05 - the vision correctly however the prefab
13:07 - does not have any visual
13:09 - but if we look in the inspector and go
13:10 - between both them you can see everything
13:12 - is exactly the same even if we go into
13:15 - the debug inspector which lets us see a
13:17 - bunch more things
13:18 - and we sign on through both of them we
13:19 - can see both of them are exactly the
13:21 - same total difference is over here the
13:23 - phone but everything else is exactly the
13:25 - same every single field matched up
13:27 - perfectly so what exactly is going on
13:29 - here well the answer is there's one very
13:32 - important feel to a skin mesh render
13:34 - that does not show up on either the
13:35 - regular inspector or the debug inspector
13:38 - and that field is this one the skin mesh
13:40 - render dot bones the skin mesh render
13:42 - must have this ceiling set and it cannot
13:44 - be set in the inspector in any way also
13:46 - it needs to be set in an extremely
13:48 - specific way otherwise again it won't
13:50 - work so here i have a simple script to
13:52 - assign the bones
13:54 - it has a reference to the skin mesh
13:55 - render prefab then also has a reference
13:58 - to the base skin mesh renderer this is
14:00 - the original one on the character and
14:02 - finally it also has a reference to the
14:03 - root bone then over here it instantiates
14:06 - the prefab as a child of this object
14:09 - then sets the bones array with the same
14:11 - ones as the original ones assigns the
14:13 - root bone and then down here also prints
14:15 - out all the transform bones and all the
14:17 - bone lists over here in the editor i
14:19 - drag all the references so first of all
14:21 - the pre-file over there then i've got
14:23 - the original one placed on the object
14:25 - and then finally the actual bone
14:27 - so with all this setup if i run the game
14:29 - and yep it does work there is a
14:31 - character with the spawn helmet spawned
14:32 - from a prefab i can take this clone
14:35 - enable and disable it and yep it does
14:36 - work and down here on the console we can
14:38 - see that list of bones also note how
14:41 - this is not the list of every single
14:42 - bone so for example there's nothing over
14:43 - here on the legs and also the order in
14:46 - this list is also extremely important
14:48 - if i change the original skin mesh
14:50 - render and i choose a different one so
14:52 - just drag it
14:53 - and nope the visual is no longer
14:55 - anywhere to be seen
14:57 - so this is the really tricky thing with
14:58 - skin mesh renders if you use this method
15:00 - then you must use the exact same root
15:02 - bone and also the exact same bone array
15:05 - where you grabbed it from if you don't
15:07 - if you use a different bone array or
15:09 - just organize differently if it's not
15:11 - the exact same one if you don't then the
15:13 - visual will either be invisible or it
15:15 - won't be positioned correctly also one
15:17 - big difference between the skin mesh
15:19 - render and the mesh render is that the
15:20 - skin mesh won't deform along with the
15:22 - bones whereas the mesh render will not
15:25 - whether this is a problem or not really
15:26 - depends on the kind of animations you're
15:28 - using if your game involves lots of
15:30 - squash and stretch animations then it
15:32 - might look odd with just the mesh render
15:34 - method so in that case you really do
15:35 - need to use the skin mesh render method
15:37 - however if your game just has regular
15:39 - animations without any excessive squash
15:41 - and stretch then both methods won't look
15:43 - the same and finally if your asset pack
15:45 - only comes with skin mesh renders for
15:47 - the parts but you want to use the mesh
15:49 - render method you can easily create them
15:51 - you can just drag the part that you want
15:53 - and you get just a single part however
15:56 - note how these ones using the skin mesh
15:58 - when they have a certain offset to the
15:59 - mesh so again you can use the same
16:01 - method that we used a while ago so just
16:03 - create an empty game object make this
16:04 - one a child
16:06 - and then just position this wherever you
16:07 - want so you have just like this and now
16:09 - you have a single part that you can use
16:11 - anywhere you want all right so that was
16:13 - quite a bit more complex than i actually
16:15 - thought it would be there's quite a lot
16:16 - of tiny things depending on how your ads
16:18 - are set up i tried to cover all of the
16:20 - possible ways to do this kind of thing
16:22 - so regardless of how your own assets are
16:23 - set up hopefully this video helped you
16:26 - if you want to add this kind of system
16:27 - onto your game then the best way is
16:28 - really to use an asset pack that has
16:30 - been properly set up so again i highly
16:32 - recommend the cinti modular character
16:33 - pack which is currently on sale it's
16:35 - pretty cheap and with this one alone you
16:37 - can build an infinite amount of
16:38 - characters the sale line soon so if
16:40 - you're interested definitely get it
