00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the asosaurus full of awesome tools and
00:04 - assets to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - February 23. this one is the list of
00:11 - paid systems and tools in the last video
00:12 - I'm going to cover the best three new
00:14 - assets and next one only cover top
00:15 - visions and effects as always there's
00:17 - only stats in the description and as a
00:18 - bonus you can use the coupon code monkey
00:19 - 10 to get 10 off your order speaking of
00:21 - free is something that I'm guessing all
00:23 - of you are already familiar with I
00:25 - recently launched my 10 hour free course
00:26 - I'm really happy with the resultant
00:28 - reception has been literally 100
00:30 - positive I don't think I saw a single
00:32 - negative comment and the plan of asking
00:34 - you to like the video to make it go
00:35 - viral on the YouTube algorithm
00:36 - definitely worked right now the video
00:38 - has 200k views which is 10 times more
00:40 - than normal amount so thank you all so
00:42 - much I truly hope the courses helped you
00:44 - on your own Game Dev journey and a
00:46 - special thank you to the people that did
00:48 - buy the completely optional paid course
00:49 - or did a super thanks or became a
00:52 - channel member thanks to you I did
00:53 - manage to break even on the money that I
00:55 - spent on the assets so thank you also
00:57 - for you right now the SSR is giving away
00:59 - an asset apparently it's a new one every
01:01 - week so you just go into the link and
01:03 - use the coupon to get a camelli for free
01:04 - there's also a sale on new and training
01:06 - assets so if there's something you saw
01:08 - recently in one of these asset list
01:10 - videos it might be discount alright so
01:12 - starting off with a nice you want to add
01:13 - notes to your game it's very freeform
01:15 - you can have an empty board where you
01:17 - can place notes anywhere you want you
01:19 - can add some text add some images a
01:21 - bunch of arrows and you can even add a
01:23 - bunch of interactive elements like some
01:25 - check boxes positions colors and so on
01:27 - the main thing is that it's on freeform
01:28 - so you have plenty of space for all of
01:30 - your designs there's a bunch of websites
01:31 - that do this kind of note-taking thing
01:33 - but if you want one directly inside
01:34 - Unity then this tune looks great they
01:36 - also have a free version if you want to
01:38 - try it out first up next here's an
01:39 - interesting one it's a climbing system
01:41 - this is actually a topic that I've done
01:43 - some research to make a tutorial but
01:45 - haven't quite managed to do it yet it
01:46 - can definitely be quite tricky to get it
01:48 - working right handling the climbing
01:50 - positions the climbing logic all of that
01:52 - can be quite tricky so using a pre-made
01:54 - asset can definitely save you a ton of
01:55 - time and of course this works great on
01:57 - both moving meshes so something like a
01:59 - boss but also on some static meshes just
02:01 - for adding some climbing somewhere in
02:03 - your game the description says that very
02:04 - few games feature mechanics kind of like
02:06 - this one and if that is right so by
02:08 - adding this to your game you're
02:09 - definitely helping it stand out then
02:10 - here's a gorgeous one all about making
02:12 - some very unique books it looks really
02:14 - insanely good like I've mentioned many
02:16 - times if you want to find success
02:17 - nowadays you need to stand out in some
02:19 - way and adding such a unique visual to
02:21 - your game would definitely make it send
02:22 - out you can flip pages in a very
02:24 - satisfying way go forwards or backwards
02:26 - you can place models on the pages and
02:28 - they track along with that page it works
02:30 - on all the render pipelines and it also
02:31 - uses bursts and jobs to make it insanely
02:33 - performant so no very interesting tool
02:35 - if you want to get a very unique visual
02:37 - up next here's a 204 generating music
02:39 - imma say that for me sound design is one
02:41 - of the parts of game development that I
02:43 - know least about I normally just play
02:45 - one song on Loop and that's it
02:46 - previously using something a bit more
02:48 - Dynamic always yields better results so
02:50 - this one is a tool where you can choose
02:51 - a genre and a mood and then it generates
02:53 - a unique song so with this you could add
02:55 - tons of unique music to your game
02:57 - without having to spend thousands on
02:59 - buying individual products or hiring a
03:00 - musician you can make every level or
03:02 - every scene have a unique track the
03:04 - interface looks pretty easy to use and
03:06 - the resulting video does sound really
03:07 - good so if that's representative of the
03:09 - quality of everything this generates and
03:11 - that is definitely good news next here
03:12 - we have a grid Builder tool as you know
03:14 - I have my really detailed series on
03:16 - making a grid system if you want to
03:18 - build your own you can follow those
03:19 - videos or check out my turn-based
03:21 - strategy course for a more guided path
03:22 - but if only you want is just a tool you
03:24 - can simply use then this one doesn't
03:26 - look great it has lots of features
03:27 - supports both 2D and 3D you can place
03:30 - objects from an overhead view or down on
03:32 - the ground it supports vertical grids
03:34 - everything with a customizable size and
03:36 - visual there's a custom inspector to
03:37 - help you create whatever grade you want
03:39 - and set up all the settings so if all
03:41 - you want is just a grid system that is
03:42 - ready to use instead of building your
03:44 - own then this one looks great up next
03:46 - here is a nice UI for handling game
03:48 - options and settings this is one of
03:50 - those things that nobody covers in
03:51 - tutorials because it's not really a sexy
03:53 - part of game development but it is
03:55 - something you must have in your final
03:56 - game my massive free 10 hour course is
03:58 - probably one of the very few YouTube
04:00 - videos that does cover this and even
04:02 - then what I do in that course is a very
04:03 - simple options menu so having an asset
04:05 - like this one which contains a very
04:07 - complete options menu this is definitely
04:08 - a great way to speed up your projects
04:10 - and make them look quite a bit more
04:11 - professional especially useful if you're
04:13 - doing lots of prototypes in game jams
04:15 - for those games people usually don't
04:17 - bother spending time to make some
04:18 - options but if you can just drag and
04:20 - drop this then it can definitely be a
04:21 - very nice bonus then if you have some
04:23 - flexible objects in your game like maybe
04:25 - some hair or some cloth then look at
04:27 - this soon it does exactly what you
04:28 - expect you can set up some bone parts
04:30 - and automatically react to physics
04:31 - apparently this one is a lot more
04:33 - performant than some other tools so if
04:35 - you need this kind of thing on tons of
04:36 - characters then maybe that can be a huge
04:38 - Advantage it has an extremely detailed
04:40 - documentation with lots of samples and
04:41 - guides and also works well on top of any
04:44 - animation or really any motion system or
04:46 - maybe you're more interested in 2D if so
04:48 - here is a nice procedural landscape tool
04:50 - you have tons of parameters you can play
04:51 - around with it's generated which means
04:53 - you can make some infinite levels you
04:55 - can use it to build a background or make
04:57 - the actual unplayable area looking at
04:59 - the shape of the Hill it reminds me of
05:00 - an awesome game that I used to play as a
05:02 - kid it was called the elastic Mania I
05:04 - played that for hours on end it was
05:05 - really awesome and with this you only it
05:07 - would be great to get a quick prototype
05:08 - like that up and running quickly there's
05:10 - also a web demo you can try out next
05:12 - here's a really interesting one you can
05:14 - add some custom gizmos to your game one
05:16 - very important thing is these are not
05:17 - just editor gizmos they are visible and
05:19 - usable in game another important thing
05:21 - is how they can rotate so if your
05:23 - character is on a hill you can see the
05:25 - Gizmo attached correctly so with that
05:26 - this is definitely a very useful
05:28 - debugging tool you can make it show the
05:29 - character velocity add some handles to
05:31 - move some objects visualize some
05:33 - raycasts some linecast and a bunch of
05:34 - things you can easily draw cubes or any
05:36 - other mesh shapes so tons of options and
05:38 - on top of that visually it also looks
05:40 - great with lots of visual options then
05:42 - one thing that all games need is the
05:43 - ability to gather feedback you always
05:45 - have access to forums or emails or
05:47 - something like that but making it easy
05:48 - for the player to give you feedback is
05:50 - very important and it will definitely
05:51 - increase the chance of you getting that
05:53 - super valuable feedback so for that a
05:55 - tune like this can be hugely helpful you
05:57 - can easily add this window onto your
05:58 - game then the player can write whatever
06:00 - text they want and even include several
06:02 - screenshots they can draw on top to
06:04 - easily identify exactly what is going
06:06 - wrong by the way if you want to learn
06:07 - how to draw something on top I have a
06:09 - tutorial on that subject it also reports
06:11 - system data and in the end the entire
06:12 - report is visible directly inside Unity
06:14 - Cloud Diagnostics so you don't even need
06:16 - to handle hosting yourself alright so
06:17 - those are my top 10 new tools and
06:19 - systems on the NTS store for February
06:21 - 23. there's links on the description and
06:23 - as a bonus you can use the coupon code

06:26 - check out my own free and paint assets
06:28 - on the store alright hope that's useful
