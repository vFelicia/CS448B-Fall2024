00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - November 22. in this first video I'll be
00:12 - covering a list of free assets and next
00:13 - ones I'll be covering paid apps and
00:15 - tools also stay tuned because it's
00:17 - November which means Black Friday this
00:20 - Monday the sale starts on the unity
00:21 - asset store I'll be making an overview
00:23 - video showcasing some of my highlights
00:25 - this sale will have Flash Deals at 70
00:27 - off you can already see what assets from
00:29 - Beyond that deep discount and when there
00:32 - will also be a Black Friday sale on the
00:34 - simply store also starting out this
00:36 - Monday and finally if you want some low
00:38 - poly Assets in a nice cute style there
00:40 - is a homophone running right now as
00:42 - usual a super deep 95 off discount this
00:45 - one is low poly but it's pretty
00:46 - different from the Cindy style I quite
00:48 - like how the characters are pretty cute
00:49 - as usual the links in the description
00:51 - are film linked so if you pick up
00:53 - anything during these sales you get some
00:54 - awesome assets at a nice discount and I
00:56 - get a nice commission alright so on to
00:58 - the top 10 lists are now off with a pack
01:00 - that is maybe a little bit late it's a
01:02 - Halloween pack but still even outside of
01:05 - Halloween this looks like a great free
01:07 - pack if you're making some kind of
01:08 - horror games or just a mount spooky game
01:10 - then this would fit right in
01:12 - features quite a lot of prompts mainly
01:14 - to build a cemetery-like environment so
01:16 - there's quite a lot of objects for this
01:18 - free pack anything like this style then
01:20 - this dev has tons more next here's an
01:22 - interesting simple tool that does
01:24 - exactly what it's called it's a
01:25 - background recompiler
01:27 - you normally save the code file in
01:29 - something like Visual Studio but Unity
01:31 - only starts compiling when you alt tap
01:33 - the DNT window so this one is a simple
01:35 - tool that can helply save a few seconds
01:37 - by starting the compilation right away
01:39 - so if you'd like to save a tiny bit of
01:41 - time then this sounds like a very nice
01:42 - very simple tool next up if you need a
01:45 - really good looking pistol model check
01:46 - out this one I really like the sound on
01:49 - this one it looks semi-futuristic but
01:51 - nothing to sci-fi
01:52 - it includes the pistol a really nice
01:55 - case and some ammo also everything is
01:57 - split into Parts allowing to easily
01:59 - animate them then if you need some
02:01 - environment check out this repack it
02:03 - includes a whole bunch of pieces like
02:05 - some rocks and trees that you can
02:07 - combine in many ways to build a nice
02:09 - simple environment all of it in a pretty
02:11 - nice cartoon style after that here we
02:13 - have another nice system this one is a
02:15 - loot table
02:17 - you either find some objects and what
02:19 - chances they have to drop it features a
02:21 - nice custom editor so you can easily
02:23 - visualize the percent chance and set up
02:25 - all the prefabs you can set the chance
02:27 - to drop as well as adding some
02:29 - guaranteed drops then if you need a
02:31 - bunch of fantasy props check out this
02:32 - one you could build an entire village
02:35 - with just these assets you've got some
02:37 - wooden fences a bunch of barrels a
02:39 - campfire a tent and a whole bunch more
02:41 - next here's an interesting one it's a
02:44 - bunch of noise textures these are super
02:46 - useful for quickly doing all kinds of
02:48 - effects for example I've covered a quick
02:50 - video on how to do the transition effect
02:52 - like in Hades it's all based on a black
02:55 - and white texture sort of like these
02:56 - ones if only neither are some
02:58 - interesting grayscale shapes and a
02:59 - simple Shader so this pack looks great
03:01 - for achieving all those kind of
03:03 - interesting effects then here is an
03:05 - interesting Quest system it's based on
03:07 - scriptable objects it allows you to
03:09 - easily create some quests and Trigger
03:11 - some progression looks like a nice
03:13 - system to get a prototype up and running
03:15 - quickly if you're working on an
03:17 - old-school 2D game check out this right
03:19 - back it looks very much inspired by
03:21 - something along the lines of Castlevania
03:23 - it features 400 free assets so this one
03:26 - is actually a pretty huge pack then if
03:28 - you need some realistic nature textures
03:30 - check out this one there's lots of
03:32 - texture Maps so it includes the color
03:34 - texture as well as some ambient
03:36 - conclusion some height and some normal
03:38 - Maps you've got some sand rock mud grass
03:41 - all of them looking really excellent it
03:43 - even includes pre-made terrain layers so
03:45 - it's all ready to use alright so those
03:47 - are my top 10 free new assets on the
03:49 - unity s store for November 22. there's
03:51 - links on the description and also check
