00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code machiene
00:01 - in this video we're going to view a
00:03 - summary of the tooltip series let's
00:05 - begin
00:08 - so the goal in this series is to make a
00:10 - tool tip this is a great UI element that
00:12 - we can use to show extra information to
00:14 - the player later we will adapt our code
00:17 - to easily show a item stats tooltip so
00:20 - first we're going to create the basic
00:21 - tool tip we want to make a simple UI
00:23 - element that we can show and hide while
00:25 - following the mouse we also want the
00:27 - background to adapt to whatever text we
00:29 - give it for testing we're going to show
00:31 - the tooltip when we pass the mouse over
00:33 - a button or a label then we're going to
00:36 - work on making sure the tooltip is
00:37 - always visible
00:38 - that means calculating the background
00:40 - size to see if the tooltip is leaving
00:42 - the screen and if so move it accordingly
00:44 - with the tooltip always visible inside
00:46 - the screen we're going to add the
00:48 - ability to update it in real time this
00:50 - is great for displaying something that
00:52 - is constantly changing like a condom we
00:54 - will also add various helper functions
00:56 - and extension methods to make our class
00:58 - very easy to use afterwards we will
01:01 - create a separate on tip class to show a
01:04 - warning so we'll make it flash red and
01:06 - display a warning message for some time
01:08 - this is very useful in addition to the
01:10 - regular tooltip so we can show the
01:12 - player an error message like if he can't
01:14 - afford a certain amount and finally
01:16 - we're going to take our code and quickly
01:18 - adapt it into a complex item stats
01:20 - window we only use the code for
01:22 - following the mouse and keeping it
01:24 - inside the screen while adding many new
01:26 - text films and images this will show you
01:28 - how important it is to write code that
01:30 - is easy to understand so you can adapt
01:32 - it to something different when needed so
01:34 - that's a plan for the tooltip series
01:36 - it's a great UI element that is
01:38 - essential if your game is UI heavy also
01:41 - if you ever need to create some sort of
01:43 - item stats window we won't be able to
01:44 - easily adapt the code to support it so
01:47 - go watch the point list and begin
01:48 - learning right now as always you can
01:50 - download the project from the utilities
01:52 - for each video in the series from unity
01:54 - kurma keep calm if you have any
01:55 - questions post them in the comments and
01:57 - I'll do my best to answer them subscribe
01:58 - for more videos and I'll see you next
02:00 - time
