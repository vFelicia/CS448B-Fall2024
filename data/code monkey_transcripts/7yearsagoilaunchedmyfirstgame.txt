00:00 - this video is made possible by my game
00:02 - bomber play seven awesome games and help
00:04 - support the channel get the steam game
00:05 - bundle at unity code monkey comm slash
00:08 - game bong in this video I'm going to
00:10 - tell the story about the time that I
00:12 - launched my very first PC game seven
00:14 - years ago
00:14 - the game was survivors Quan which was a
00:16 - strategy action game that still to this
00:18 - day I think it's mechanically very
00:20 - interesting I'm telling my story in the
00:22 - hopes of inspiring you by showing how we
00:23 - all start from nothing let's begin so
00:31 - all the way back in 2012 was when I
00:33 - finally decided that I want to make a
00:35 - complete desktop PC game I covered in my
00:38 - entire game that journey in another
00:39 - video and if you've seen that video then
00:41 - you know that was the point that I
00:42 - transitioned away from flash and into PC
00:45 - game development in December of 2012 I
00:47 - started looking at how I could possibly
00:49 - make a PC game which is how I eventually
00:51 - came upon unity for design I wanted
00:54 - something that was mouse heavy so I was
00:56 - looking for a design that really made
00:57 - use of the PC as a platform and that
01:00 - design eventually ended up becoming
01:01 - survivors but still to this day I think
01:04 - it's a really cool game with some really
01:06 - interesting mechanics it's definitely
01:07 - not very polished and very clunky at
01:09 - times which clearly shows that it was my
01:11 - very first game but mechanically
01:13 - speaking I think it still holds up today
01:15 - especially the sequence survivors for
01:17 - gun points which features the same base
01:19 - mechanics with a ton more polish so I
01:21 - start working on what eventually became
01:23 - survivor squad all the way back in
01:25 - December of 2012 and six months later in
01:28 - May of 2013 was when it finally came out
01:31 - so that was a really interesting time I
01:33 - was really pleased with what I built I
01:35 - learned a ton and I finally had made a
01:37 - complete proper PC game I've played it
01:40 - in full screen and it worked exactly as
01:41 - I imagined so in that sense I was
01:43 - definitely feeling very good about it
01:45 - especially in retrospect since now I
01:47 - know that about 90% of people who start
01:49 - making games never actually finish them
01:51 - so the fact that I started in completely
01:53 - game over the course of six months was
01:55 - definitely a great thing however in
01:57 - order for it become a job it also needed
01:59 - to make money and well that's where the
02:01 - problems came in now back then Steam
02:03 - already had greenlight it was actually
02:05 - announced about one year earlier and the
02:07 - announcement of greenlight is one of the
02:09 - main things that first planted the seed
02:10 - in my head that I could make a PC game
02:13 - before greenlight essentially you need
02:15 - to know someone so for me as a random
02:17 - kid and living in Portugal obviously I
02:19 - didn't have any connections and didn't
02:20 - know anyone in the games industry
02:22 - so before greenlight the idea of being
02:24 - an indie game developer was simply not
02:26 - possible at all
02:27 - however greenlight did happen and with
02:29 - it came the possibility of making PC
02:31 - games and making a living so when I
02:34 - first announced the game I quickly
02:35 - submitted it to greenlight I wrote on
02:37 - the text made the page made some cool
02:39 - gifs and so on
02:40 - I remember the response was free good
02:42 - the game was decent back then and people
02:45 - seem to really like the concept behind
02:46 - it however back then the queue to get
02:48 - through green light was still huge you
02:50 - needed thousands upon thousands of votes
02:52 - in order to move up the list and finally
02:54 - get accepted again with me being just a
02:56 - random kid with no connections and no
02:58 - concept of marketing I couldn't really
03:00 - get that many votes
03:01 - so when May came and my design was
03:03 - complete and I felt the game was ready
03:04 - for release I hadn't been accepted yet
03:06 - so I did what every other small indie
03:09 - developer did back then which was to
03:11 - simply release it on my own website now
03:14 - thankfully back then Humble Bundle
03:15 - already existed with their extremely
03:17 - useful humble widget without that it
03:19 - would have definitely been a pain to
03:20 - handle all of the payments distributing
03:22 - the game files but thankfully through
03:24 - that widget it was very easy so i
03:26 - polished up the website made a trailer
03:28 - and released the game and well you can
03:31 - probably guess what happens when an
03:32 - unknown game from a first-time unknown
03:34 - in the developer in a tiny country
03:36 - launches a game the answer is well
03:38 - pretty close to zero sales I think on
03:40 - the first day it sold something like
03:42 - five copies and then on the second day
03:43 - your whopping twenty copies and then
03:45 - back down to ten and then three and so
03:47 - on so very quickly it dropped down to
03:49 - zero now like I said that was a really
03:52 - interesting time so I was really happy
03:54 - to have made a complete proper PC game
03:56 - examine like I wanted but the end result
03:59 - of six months of work was something like
04:01 - three hundred bucks so it seemed that
04:03 - despite of my efforts my dream of making
04:05 - it as an indie game developer wasn't
04:07 - really going to happen one interesting
04:10 - thing was how the game did get an
04:12 - article on Rock Paper Shotgun which was
04:14 - really awesome back then when I first
04:16 - started making PC games two of my main
04:18 - dream like calls were to get my game on
04:20 - Rock Paper Shotgun and get it reviewed
04:23 - by totalbiscuit
04:24 - on his WTF his series family that's like
04:27 - girl never came to pass so that's what
04:30 - happened when I watch my game I was
04:32 - happy with what I produced and sad with
04:34 - the financial results for a while that
04:36 - was a pretty dark time I mean back then
04:38 - I had dropped out of college about a
04:40 - year before that so I really didn't see
04:41 - much of a future for me
04:42 - when I first saw green light I saw a
04:45 - possible feature and then when I saw
04:47 - zero copies I saw that possible feature
04:49 - disappear in front of my eyes but then I
04:52 - did see a glimmer of hope and look at my
04:55 - green light page which was getting a
04:56 - slow trickle of upvotes and simply did
04:58 - the math if the votes kept coming in
05:00 - then it was only a matter of time till I
05:02 - had enough to reach the top of the list
05:03 - and be approved and if I got on Steam
05:06 - then I would get a second chance at
05:07 - success once I had that thought my brain
05:10 - clicked and that's when I felt that fire
05:12 - again and that feeling that it was still
05:13 - possible so I went right back to it I
05:16 - was going to improve the game as much as
05:18 - I could in the time that I had so that's
05:20 - what I did over the next five months I
05:22 - fixed a ton of bugs polished a ton of
05:24 - things added more features and improved
05:26 - it as much as I was capable at the time
05:28 - and then it finally happened I got the
05:31 - email that said the game had been
05:32 - approved for only son scene so that's
05:34 - probably the best email I have ever
05:36 - gotten my plan for a second chance was
05:38 - finally coming to fruition one of the
05:40 - more interesting videos I made is the
05:42 - 200 days in greenlight video it's on the
05:45 - analyst web Studios channel linked in
05:46 - the description
05:47 - it shows the graph as I went through
05:49 - green light on with some comments I
05:51 - pretty much took a screenshot every
05:53 - single day and then made that video so
05:55 - it's really cool to see the progression
05:56 - if you want to see how things were back
05:58 - then and definitely give them all so the
06:01 - game was accepted which meant I had
06:02 - access to the same back-end then it was
06:05 - still a ton of work left to do I had to
06:07 - make the complete steam store page I had
06:10 - to learn everything about how steam
06:11 - bells work which was really complex and
06:13 - really confusing that definitely took me
06:16 - several days to finally understand how
06:17 - it works and about my bill and once I
06:20 - appointed it I immediately tested it
06:21 - with my own account watching my game
06:23 - from the steam point that was yet
06:25 - another great moment to see a game that
06:27 - I made going through the steam client I
06:29 - mean I spent most of my childhood
06:30 - playing counter-strike so I remember
06:32 - playing 1.5 and hearing about this new
06:35 - program called steam that was going to
06:36 - be required for future comes track
06:38 - versions so I got steam many years ago
06:40 - right
06:41 - lunch since it was a requirement to play
06:43 - CS 1.6 little did I know that many years
06:46 - later I would have my own game on that
06:48 - little program so getting the bill
06:50 - deployed was really tricky but I managed
06:52 - to do it then I wanted to do the best
06:54 - work possible so I want to add
06:55 - achievements and all these team features
06:57 - so yet another challenging thing
06:59 - figuring out how on earth is these team
07:01 - API work making all the achievement
07:03 - icons writing all the names and
07:04 - description and setting up all the code
07:06 - to trigger the achievements I definitely
07:08 - felt this was my one true chance so I
07:10 - did only could just to make it work and
07:12 - then finally after all this on November
07:15 - 8 2013 the game was launched on scene so
07:18 - in terms of results it actually did
07:20 - surprisingly well back then steam had
07:22 - fewer games coming out every day so a
07:24 - game which looked interesting and had a
07:26 - unique concept did stand-up in that
07:28 - first month on seeing the game sold
07:30 - about $15,000 so in that first month I
07:33 - made more money than I made working on
07:34 - flash for over 5 years and it's
07:36 - obviously several orders of magnitude
07:38 - more than I made when I launched the
07:40 - game on my own website in May now
07:42 - depending on where you live 15,000 might
07:44 - not seem like much but here in Portugal
07:46 - that's pretty much a full-time income so
07:48 - at that point any game development
07:50 - became my official job now if you saw
07:53 - the games out journey video then you
07:54 - know that things didn't go so well after
07:56 - that this is a very volatile business
07:58 - and I've certainly had my ups and downs
08:00 - over the years but still for the time
08:02 - being the game was very successful
08:04 - design wise I'm still very happy with
08:06 - the film review mechanic is still very
08:08 - interesting and unique even today the
08:11 - sequel survivor squad complex is still
08:13 - in my favorite games I'm a despite being
08:15 - a financial failure another really cool
08:17 - video that I made was the game
08:19 - development time lapse it shows the game
08:21 - being built over time starting
08:22 - completely from scratch and going
08:24 - through all the code being written and
08:25 - all the assets being added it's really
08:28 - interesting to see all the mechanics
08:29 - being added all the levels being created
08:31 - the world map being generated the
08:33 - visuals going from temporary
08:34 - placeholders to the best that I can make
08:36 - the time so yeah really interesting to
08:38 - see it all come together it's such a
08:39 - long a long time we go check out the
08:42 - full video linked in description now
08:43 - that was seven years ago which honestly
08:46 - feels like a lifetime ago
08:47 - since then I have published seven more
08:49 - games wrote something like a million
08:51 - lines of code learned a ton about game
08:53 - design
08:54 - and marketing and I made this channel
08:56 - with now over 300 videos sharing what
08:59 - I've learned over all that time so
09:01 - that's the story of how I made my very
09:03 - first PC game
09:04 - I covered my whole game that journey in
09:07 - another video that one covers how I
09:08 - started making IRC games back when I was
09:10 - 10 years old then eventually found flash
09:13 - and finally seven years ago I got onto
09:15 - unity and made my very first PC game if
09:18 - you haven't seen it yet then definitely
09:19 - check it out that video took a long time
09:21 - to make but I'm really happy with how it
09:23 - ended up alright so I hope my story has
09:26 - inspired you and provided with some more
09:28 - detail as to what any game development
09:30 - is relevant like and my message to you
09:32 - wherever you are in your journey is to
09:34 - keep it up and keep making games we all
09:37 - start from nothing but if you persevere
