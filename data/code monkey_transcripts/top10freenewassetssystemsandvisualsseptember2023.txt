00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - just a quick mention my game is finally
00:04 - coming out on Monday I'm still really
00:05 - hard at work on it I've been working
00:07 - pretty much 16 hour days these past two
00:09 - weeks I really want the game to be good
00:10 - I really hope you'll enjoy it and
00:12 - another thing normally I split these
00:13 - acid videos in three one for each type
00:15 - but since this month has been really
00:17 - intense both because of working on my
00:18 - game and of course the whole Unity
00:20 - pricing thing that really messed up my
00:21 - whole schedule so I merged all three in
00:23 - just this one video here is the list of
00:25 - top free assets then the systems and
00:27 - tools and finally visions and effects
00:29 - also if you need some assets there's a
00:30 - new home bundle with a ton of cinty aets
00:32 - so if you're a fan of the low poly style
00:34 - you've got tons of stuff here you've got
00:36 - the horror mention for a bunch of spooky
00:37 - stuff sci-fi C which I'm actually using
00:39 - a bunch of these in my own game The
00:41 - Heist back this one is super useful has
00:43 - lots of weapons and a really interesting
00:44 - environment one for Samurai Vikings
00:46 - Western apocalypse and so on as usual
00:49 - these bundles are always great deals so
00:51 - this like 97% off for just 20 bucks so
00:53 - if you need assets go ahead and get it
00:55 - okay so here are the top 10 free new
00:56 - assets all right so on to the top 10
00:59 - list starting off with a gorgeous
01:00 - looking fantasy map it looks really
01:02 - great this could be taken straight from
01:03 - your Lord of the Rings game or something
01:05 - like that it's a modular pack with tons
01:07 - of pieces so lots of icons for forests
01:09 - mountains and so on as well as various
01:11 - symbols for castles quests enemies
01:13 - Villages and more it definitely requires
01:15 - our this skill to put the final map
01:17 - together but this is a great starting
01:18 - point next for an interesting tool here
01:20 - is a way to send emails directly from
01:22 - inside your Unity build like the name
01:24 - says this one is super simple and it
01:25 - includes all of the source code so this
01:27 - would be a great research asset if you
01:29 - want to see all the code behind how to
01:31 - manually connect to an SMTP server and
01:33 - send an email you can Define the subject
01:35 - body you can send to multiple recipients
01:37 - you can send HTML and even send some
01:39 - attachments so for example this could be
01:41 - great to build a feedback form directly
01:43 - inside your game or maybe some automated
01:45 - emails when something happens next for
01:47 - some visuals here are some nice pieces
01:48 - to make some gorgeous alen worlds these
01:51 - are simple low poly assets and you have
01:53 - just enough pieces to make quite a nice
01:54 - world you could even technically recolor
01:56 - it with different colors and just with
01:58 - this one asset pack you can make
01:59 - multiple worlds it comes with a demo
02:01 - scene preset so you can easily try it
02:02 - out then for another simple tool here is
02:04 - a missing reference finder this does
02:06 - exactly what the name says if you've
02:08 - ever seen those annoying messages in the
02:10 - console telling you that some game
02:11 - object is missing a script reference
02:13 - then you know it's impossible to know
02:14 - what object is throwing that message
02:16 - this to basally helps solve that just
02:17 - one button to search and it shows all
02:19 - the results nice and simple next if
02:21 - you're making some car game here's a
02:23 - nice visual pack it's got a very nice
02:25 - variety of cars so you have a general
02:27 - sedan you've got some muscle cars
02:29 - there's a cheap an exotic and even an F1
02:31 - car these are relatively low poly so you
02:33 - can easily recolor them to get tons of
02:35 - variation then if You' like to keep a
02:37 - twoo list but without having to use an
02:39 - external website check out this one this
02:41 - looks extremely feature complete you can
02:43 - easily Define tasks that you want to do
02:44 - you can group them by type in any way
02:46 - you want you can mark them as complete
02:48 - or incomplete easily view the progress
02:50 - for each grouping and also lets you add
02:52 - all kinds of references so you easily
02:54 - know what script or what folder that
02:56 - task refers to if you find this one
02:57 - useful this dev has a pro version with a
02:59 - bunch of more features and up next for a
03:01 - nice runtime console here's one it feels
03:03 - like lately every month there's at least
03:05 - one excellent console I guess that's
03:06 - great for developers who want excellent
03:08 - free tools a console like this one is
03:10 - one of the most useful tools you can
03:11 - have this one seems to be very well
03:13 - built with lots of features it even
03:14 - includes the ability to easily add your
03:16 - own commands with just one simple
03:18 - attribute or maybe you just want a
03:19 - visual character if so here's a nice one
03:22 - with a giant hand it includes the
03:23 - character model as well as some
03:25 - animations and particle effects the
03:26 - proportions look a bit strange but the
03:28 - hand does look quite cool then if you
03:30 - like playing with colors here's a color
03:32 - palette tool you basically Define some
03:34 - colors you give them names and assign
03:36 - the color itself then you can easily
03:37 - swap out all the colors with one button
03:39 - click so for example on a multiplayer
03:41 - game you could have one pallet for the
03:43 - player one maybe something in blue and
03:45 - then another red color palette for
03:47 - player two or you can just go crazy and
03:49 - randomize all the colors maybe that also
03:51 - works and if you'd like to make a super
03:52 - simple internet connection check out
03:54 - this simple UDP tool this is a very
03:56 - simple implementation you've got a very
03:58 - very small packet SI ni you can send
04:00 - some unreliable data with just one bite
04:02 - it includes all the source codes so
04:04 - again this one would be great if you'd
04:05 - like to research and see how all this
04:07 - works a tool like this one can be quite
04:08 - useful if you're making a non-game
04:10 - application unity and you want to make
04:12 - just a simple barebones connection like
04:13 - perhaps just connecting your PC to your
04:15 - mobile phone through your local network
04:17 - to build perhaps some kind of
04:18 - interesting Electronics project okay so
04:20 - now on to the list of top systems and
04:22 - tools all right so starting off with a
04:24 - nice toel to add something that almost
04:26 - always makes your game look better it's
04:28 - real time Global illumination if you've
04:30 - ever looked at your own games and
04:31 - wondered why it doesn't look as good as
04:33 - the games you play Chances Are lighting
04:34 - is a big difference without Global
04:36 - illumination things that are in the
04:37 - shade are completely black but in
04:39 - reality light bounces so even something
04:41 - in the shade still has some color this
04:43 - tool lets you easily add Global
04:44 - illumination a really fast way it's easy
04:46 - to add fully compatible with urp you can
04:49 - customize everything and works on all
04:50 - platforms next for a simple tool to
04:52 - greatly improve your UI here is SDF
04:55 - image Unity already has a built-in
04:57 - outline and Shadow component but those
04:58 - are really basic that one is really just
05:00 - meant for quick prototypes it really
05:02 - does not look good in many scenarios
05:04 - whereas this one on the other hand this
05:05 - one looks absolutely excellent it uses
05:07 - stdf so the outlines are super high
05:09 - quality they're all extremely detailed
05:11 - it doesn't matter if your Sprite has
05:13 - rounded corners or sharp edges this
05:15 - looks good in every scenario you can
05:17 - easily tint the outline in any color you
05:19 - can set any thickness you want you can
05:21 - add shadows and set Direction you just
05:23 - simply use a different component and
05:24 - play around with all the properties in
05:26 - the Shader so a really simple really
05:28 - excellent tool I think I might get this
05:29 - one to polish my game thany Gardians
05:32 - then for a very Advanced very complex
05:34 - tool here is RNG needs this is the
05:36 - ultimate probability distribution plugin
05:38 - for un right away it looks really
05:40 - intimidating a mountain of numbers and
05:42 - percentages but if you're making some
05:44 - kind of complex RPG with tons of Loot
05:46 - and drop changes then you definitely do
05:48 - want a complex tool just like this one
05:50 - and despite being so complex it has
05:51 - custom inspectors to make it really easy
05:53 - to use you can easily drag some bars to
05:55 - Define drop rates there's no need to
05:57 - manually write numbers so if your game
05:58 - has lots of chance and drop rates and
06:00 - definitely get this one next if you have
06:02 - some projectiles and you want them to
06:03 - move in interesting ways check out this
06:05 - one you can fire projectiles in weird
06:07 - shapes while making them follow the path
06:09 - to the Target perfectly so they don't
06:10 - have to just go straight you can Define
06:12 - some weird curves for them to follow
06:14 - maybe you can even Define a fixed amount
06:16 - of time to reach a Target regardless of
06:18 - distance whatever settings you choose
06:19 - you can also predict where the
06:20 - projectile will go and also a projectile
06:23 - doesn't have to be just a bullet that
06:24 - can also be your player so you can see
06:26 - when you jump where will the player land
06:28 - it's quite an interesting tool if you
06:30 - have some idea where it involves tons of
06:32 - projectiles that do more than just go
06:33 - straight next if you're working in VR
06:35 - and you'd like to draw something then
06:37 - check out this asset it is very simple
06:39 - and does exactly what you expect you can
06:41 - pick up a bunch of pens with various
06:43 - colors and draw whatever you want you
06:44 - can use the Eraser if you make some kind
06:46 - of mistake optionally you can also save
06:48 - the image onto a file it's all using
06:50 - compute Shad so this is all very
06:52 - performant I can see this being a great
06:53 - addition for pretty much any VR game
06:55 - even if your game is something like a
06:57 - shooter you can just easily add this to
06:58 - some part of in your world to make it a
07:00 - tiny bit more unique then if you're
07:02 - working with animations and you want to
07:03 - avoid that transition spaghetti check
07:05 - out this one this is motion matching
07:07 - it's a different way to handle your
07:09 - animations instead of fixed transitions
07:11 - you have some Dynamic movement of your
07:13 - character and then the system
07:14 - automatically picks which animation best
07:16 - fits that movement so this is the kind
07:18 - of thing that a lot of AAA games use
07:20 - games like Assassin's Creed where they
07:21 - always have those Dynamic animations
07:23 - this is the kind of thing they use this
07:24 - can make the character feel much more
07:26 - natural but also sometimes looks a
07:28 - little bit janky way it's definitely an
07:30 - interesting different method if you're
07:31 - tired of dealing with massive amounts of
07:33 - transitions then maybe try this out next
07:35 - here's a fun and simple tool for making
07:37 - light poles now this is an extremely
07:39 - simple level building tool if your world
07:41 - has some kind of electrical poles you
07:43 - can just place them and it will
07:45 - automatically draw the connections it's
07:47 - really simple it has some Randomness so
07:48 - it looks a bit more natural and it seems
07:50 - to work pretty well you just drop the
07:52 - poles in your world and you don't have
07:53 - to worry about individually modeling all
07:55 - kinds of wires everything just spawns
07:57 - automatically all of them get connected
07:59 - then if you have some performance issues
08:01 - here's a tool to help you combine and
08:03 - merge meshes and materials if you have
08:05 - tons of unique meshes and tons of unique
08:07 - materials that is going to be pretty
08:08 - heavy on the GPU so a tool like this one
08:10 - merges multiple objects into just one
08:12 - which can be quite a massive performance
08:14 - boost it automatically recones UVS and
08:16 - creates a final texture combining all of
08:18 - them so with just one click you can take
08:20 - multiple objects and merge them into
08:22 - just a single one then here's one asset
08:24 - for all of your sensing needs basically
08:26 - a collection of a ton of Ray cast and
08:28 - different cast sens ens this looks
08:30 - really complex but also really capable
08:32 - if your game involves tons of positional
08:33 - logic like for example knowing if the
08:35 - character has a ceiling above it or
08:37 - perhaps if the character is near a wall
08:39 - or has a box in front or something doing
08:40 - all of those individual rast and code
08:42 - can be quite tricky so this tool helps
08:44 - to solve that it features a custom
08:46 - inspector so you can easily set up and
08:47 - enable or disable each virtual collider
08:50 - it features an insane amount of shapes
08:52 - you've got simple Rays you've got box
08:53 - ciders some capsules arcs radiuses even
08:56 - some Sight and Sound detection it's a
08:58 - really great tool to make it easier to
09:00 - manage all of your colliders and
09:01 - collisions then for a really simple
09:03 - useful tool here is a performance
09:05 - monitor it is very simple it does
09:07 - exactly what you expect you can easily
09:09 - monitor the frame rate the memory usage
09:11 - CPU and GPU how many vertices how many
09:13 - draw calls triangles and so on it's
09:15 - super easy to add you just drag and drop
09:17 - a prefab and that's it then you can
09:18 - easily view this data anywhere so this
09:20 - can be while playing in the editor or on
09:22 - a PC build or on mobile okay so now on
09:25 - to the list of top visions and effects
09:27 - all right so starting off with a
09:29 - gorgeous nature environment this is one
09:31 - of those where if you have a prototype
09:33 - you're working on you can just use this
09:34 - demo scene directly and you instantly
09:36 - have a great world to explore this
09:38 - features a nice low poly Style with some
09:40 - highly optimized foliage or perhaps you
09:42 - need some explosions if so here's a
09:44 - great pack they all look really gorgeous
09:46 - personally I love the stylized look you
09:48 - have some fiery explosions with lots of
09:50 - glow lots of fire but then you also have
09:52 - some that are just smoke so this could
09:54 - also be useful if for example your
09:55 - character jumps from a high position
09:57 - into a puddle of M you could spawn one
09:59 - one of these then if you're making a
10:00 - shooting game you probably need some
10:02 - pistol animations if so look at this
10:04 - complete pack it's an extremely complete
10:05 - animation pack in total it's got 65
10:08 - pistol animations there's multiple
10:10 - shooting types you've got turn
10:11 - animations lots of reloads pickups and
10:14 - even some melee attacks you can of
10:16 - course then combine this with some ik to
10:18 - make it feel really natural next here's
10:19 - a really gorgeous pirate Port City just
10:22 - a few days ago the excellent game Shadow
10:24 - Gambit just came out this asset looks
10:26 - like it could be taken straight from
10:27 - that game it's got lots of modular
10:29 - pieces so you can build anything you
10:31 - like you can build various port cities
10:33 - or you can even build entire ships if
10:35 - you're making some kind of stylized part
10:37 - game then this is definitely the perfect
10:38 - pack or perhaps you're into something
10:40 - much more futuristic if so here is the
10:42 - latest CTI pack this one is all about
10:44 - Mech personally I really love this pack
10:46 - it's got lots of customization every Mac
10:48 - is so unique it's got tons of modular
10:51 - Parts you can build Macs with huge
10:52 - machine guns or some huge heavy swords
10:55 - when I first saw this pack it
10:56 - immediately made me want to build some
10:58 - kind of game with this but but I'm
10:59 - currently already insanely busy so
11:00 - perhaps maybe after I finish ninky
11:02 - Gardens and if you've got Mex then maybe
11:04 - you also want some cyber Punk characters
11:06 - to go along with it so look at this pack
11:08 - they are extremely customizable you've
11:10 - got tons of pieces to make essentially
11:12 - infinite variations with just this one
11:14 - pack you could randomize tons of
11:16 - characters and populate an entire world
11:18 - with hundreds of unique NPCs it's a
11:20 - really nice style I could also see this
11:21 - as a great pack for a multiplayer game
11:23 - with a ton of player customization then
11:25 - if you'd like to the Sol something here
11:27 - is a nice kit with a ton of the s
11:29 - effects everything from the standard one
11:31 - to dissolving with some particles you've
11:33 - got some dissolve with burn some that go
11:35 - backwards and resolve and a bunch more
11:37 - all of them look really great with tons
11:39 - of particles this one really showcased
11:41 - the power of the VFX W next if you're
11:43 - working on a 2d shooter and you need
11:44 - some great animated characters check out
11:46 - this one these are body part animation
11:48 - so these are not Sprite sheets because
11:50 - of that they look really fluid each
11:52 - character has 14 animations looking at
11:54 - this it immediately reminds me of a
11:56 - bunch of flash games back when I was
11:57 - making those I always wanted to build an
11:59 - animation system just like this one it's
12:01 - really amazing how nowadays all you have
12:03 - to do is just pick this one pack and you
12:05 - have some gorgeous 2D animations then
12:07 - here's another one that is also
12:08 - something that I've always wanted to do
12:10 - it's a pack with a ton of low poly gem
12:12 - assets personally I've always wanted to
12:14 - make some kind of gym tycoon game
12:16 - although I don't think there's a big
12:17 - audience for that so I never made it
12:19 - this one includes pretty much every
12:20 - single prop you could possibly need
12:22 - you've got various characters you've got
12:23 - some treadmills tons of machines and
12:25 - free weights it also includes lots of
12:27 - props for doing some martial arts if I
12:29 - had a time machine I would definitely
12:30 - pause time right now to spend 6 months
12:32 - making a gem tycoon game with this one
12:34 - pack somewhat related to that here is a
12:36 - myi animation pack the animations are
12:38 - definitely stylized they look really
12:40 - powerful this Dev always has some
12:42 - excellent animations features lots of
12:44 - impressive kicks punches and knees with
12:46 - a nice combat system and these
12:47 - animations you could definitely make
12:49 - something really special If instead of
12:50 - melee your game has swords then check
12:52 - out these sword slashes VFX lots of
12:54 - variation to look like all kinds of
12:56 - elements so you've got some that look
12:58 - like fire slashes some look somewhat
13:00 - Arcane you've got frost holy void and a
13:03 - bunch more it includes the slashes some
13:05 - lunges and some impact bfx then if you
13:07 - need to get a better sky for your game
13:09 - here is a predal generated one the demo
13:11 - scene looks really gorgeous it's got
13:13 - tons of settings so you can get it
13:15 - looking exactly as you want and this
13:16 - pack includes not just the sky box but
13:18 - the water as well or perhaps you're
13:20 - making an FPS game if so then you've
13:22 - probably already noticed that you need
13:24 - some great animations for the weapons
13:26 - there's tons and tons of third person
13:27 - animation packs but not that many in
13:29 - first person so this is a great one it
13:31 - includes 20 animated weapons alongside a
13:34 - first person player controller so you've
13:36 - got everything from rifles to shotguns
13:38 - to pistols and some sniper rifles if
13:40 - those are too realistic for you then
13:42 - here's a stylized pack really a massive
13:44 - amount of variety in total you've got 61
13:47 - weapons they feature pretty much any
13:49 - type you can think of and since these
13:50 - are all low poly you could also easily
13:53 - recolor them then for a very unique very
13:55 - strange character here is a Mech wheel
13:57 - it's certainly very unique I've never
13:58 - seen anything like this it's a giant
14:00 - blade wheel but then it also has some
14:02 - spider legs this could be either a very
14:04 - strange enemy in your game or who knows
14:07 - perhaps this could even be the player
14:09 - character in some strange games next if
14:11 - all you need are just some impacts then
14:13 - here's a nice pack with nothing but
14:15 - impacts it's got 10 unique impacts with
14:17 - four color variations so as always it's
14:20 - sub to you the developer to Define what
14:21 - each color represents then here's a
14:23 - really fun one it's a bunch of generic
14:25 - sci-fi screens very unique pack I don't
14:27 - think I've ever seen anything like this
14:29 - before it's a bunch of looping videos so
14:32 - these are perfect to add to the
14:33 - background of various rooms in your
14:34 - games some look very sci-fi others look
14:37 - very medical or even like they belong in
14:38 - a detective show this definitely one of
14:40 - those things that really helps add
14:42 - polish to really make your levels feel
14:43 - very lived next if your game has lots of
14:45 - electricity then here's a pack with tons
14:48 - of effects you've got lots of explosions
14:50 - some auras Buffs beams and lasers all
14:52 - them look really nice they come in
14:54 - plenty of colors for you to use in any
14:56 - way you want then if your game has a
