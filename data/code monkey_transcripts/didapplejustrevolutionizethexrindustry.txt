00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - alright so Apple has finally unveiled
00:04 - their mixed reality device this has been
00:06 - rumored for years and years by this
00:07 - point
00:08 - it's a software going the mixed reality
00:10 - headset I don't know anything about what
00:12 - you're talking about for the past few
00:13 - weeks my Twitter feed has been filmed
00:15 - with tons of messages saying that when
00:16 - this happens it's going to change
00:17 - everything so here let's watch the
00:19 - announcement then I'll give you my
00:20 - thoughts
00:21 - [Music]
00:23 - introducing Apple Vision Pro
00:26 - the era of spatial computing
00:30 - is here that's a really interesting line
00:32 - the area of spatial Computing is here so
00:35 - apparently they're doing the exact same
00:36 - thing that I was seeing on my Twitter
00:37 - feed as soon as Apple launches something
00:39 - now AR is actually a thing as always he
00:42 - showcase you always gotta take away the
00:44 - marketing from the reality so special
00:46 - Computing has obviously been the thing
00:47 - for quite some time there's been magic
00:49 - leap there was hololens there was the
00:51 - metaquest pro tilt 5 all kinds of things
00:54 - I don't really work with augmented
00:55 - reality but still let's keep watching
00:57 - when you put on Apple Vision Pro you see
01:00 - your world and everything in it your
01:03 - favorite apps live right in front of you
01:06 - so as soon as I watch this my first
01:08 - question is obviously about the external
01:10 - resolution of the color pass through it
01:12 - is great that the capacitor is in color
01:14 - and it is supposedly very high
01:15 - resolution but obviously over here we
01:17 - are seeing a render so this is not the
01:18 - actual reality so that to me is one of
01:20 - the big questions which is just how much
01:22 - Fidelity does this master actually have
01:24 - when you take it off and put it on do
01:26 - you actually notice a significant
01:27 - difference or not in theory I believe
01:29 - the headset actually has quite a lot of
01:31 - pixels so hopefully that should be good
01:32 - I assume the cameras are going to be
01:34 - pretty good considering the price so
01:35 - let's see this is Vision OS Apple's
01:39 - first ever spatial operating system
01:42 - [Music]
01:43 - it's familiar yet groundbreaking
01:47 - you navigate with your eyes now this is
01:49 - the part that is really cool being able
01:51 - to use the eyes essentially as a cursor
01:53 - that one is really awesome that does
01:55 - have a drawback which I'm going to
01:56 - mention a little bit about the
01:57 - controllers but at least in terms of
01:58 - concept being able to control things
02:00 - just by looking at it that is really
02:01 - cool that's definitely something that I
02:03 - hope will become more and more common in
02:05 - mixed reality virtual reality and so on
02:07 - as these new headsets all start to have
02:09 - cameras pointing at the eyes simply tap
02:12 - to select flick to scroll
02:15 - and use your voice to dictate
02:18 - okay so tap to select flick to scroll
02:21 - and use voice to actually write things
02:23 - on the one hand those all definitely
02:25 - sound like very intuitive input devices
02:27 - but on the other hand my one big concern
02:30 - with this is so suddenly we have a new
02:32 - entry in this space that is using a
02:34 - completely different input method from
02:35 - all the others so my question especially
02:37 - talking as a developer okay so what is
02:40 - going to happen with all of the
02:41 - interaction toolkits for example in
02:43 - unity's xnri toolkit I haven't used that
02:45 - one yet myself but I assume that one has
02:47 - a bunch of abstraction layers in order
02:48 - to abstract away what specific
02:50 - controlling you're using I assume that
02:52 - has to be done in order to make it work
02:53 - with all the various devices that exist
02:55 - so now that we have one they use a
02:57 - completely different input method I
02:58 - wonder how that's going to be sadly I
03:00 - assume that's going to actually break
03:02 - everything that exists and you're pretty
03:04 - much going to be forced to make one
03:06 - version that works for pretty much every
03:08 - single headset and another version that
03:10 - works is only for Apple so the input
03:12 - does seem externally intuitive but the
03:14 - concerns it as a developer those seem
03:16 - quite bad and of course when it comes to
03:18 - writing texting voice for me personally
03:19 - I never liked that I find that all of
03:21 - these two also converted speech into
03:23 - text so it's pretty much only work if
03:24 - you're using perfect English so for me
03:26 - in my case with my strange accent it
03:28 - usually does not pick up exactly what I
03:30 - want to say so in theory using voice to
03:32 - type that is good but in reality I'm not
03:35 - very confident about it
03:38 - it's like magic
03:40 - I do agree that it's definitely like
03:41 - magic being able to just look with your
03:43 - eyes flick your fingers to do things
03:45 - that does sound really awesome sounds
03:46 - like a really great input method so just
03:48 - speaking specifically about just this
03:50 - one device yep that seems great hey
03:52 - foundational to Apple Vision Pro is that
03:55 - you're not isolated from other people
03:57 - when someone else is in the room you can
04:00 - see them and they can see you
04:03 - okay so when I saw this part in the
04:05 - original announcement you could actually
04:06 - see the eyes but right now maybe I'm
04:08 - blind or there's an issue with this
04:09 - video but I'm not seeing the eyes but
04:11 - anyways so that that feature does seem
04:13 - quite useful or at least that's one of
04:15 - the main concerns about VR is people say
04:17 - that you don't work way too stupid so I
04:19 - wonder does adding eyes help or not
04:21 - personally I feel like simply taking off
04:23 - the headset that would be much much
04:24 - easier but I guess some people might
04:26 - like this one honestly when it comes to
04:28 - the external display for me the main
04:30 - thing is being able to actually mod it
04:31 - that's the one thing that I do find
04:32 - quite interesting so that I thought
04:34 - about and actually post on Twitter was
04:36 - the character wrench from Watch Dogs 2
04:38 - that character is constantly holding a
04:39 - headset that plays all kinds of
04:41 - interesting Sprites so maybe this is
04:43 - actually going to be the future so maybe
04:44 - in the future people will have all kinds
04:46 - of headsets like this and they'll be
04:48 - able to do all kinds of Sprites to make
04:49 - them look unique something so I could
04:51 - see that as a pretty decent use case but
04:54 - again just as a toy so in reality I
04:56 - don't think it changes way too much
04:58 - Apple Vision Pro is Apple's first ever
05:01 - 3D camera
05:03 - now this is one part that a lot of
05:04 - people were making fun on Twitter but
05:06 - honestly I don't really get it I mean I
05:08 - I do get that it looks quite silly
05:10 - having something staring at your kids it
05:12 - does seem a bit strange but on the other
05:14 - hand I really don't think it's any
05:16 - different from holding a small rectangle
05:18 - like a mobile phone holding a camera I
05:19 - really don't see how it's much different
05:21 - from that so I do agree that it does
05:23 - sound silly very strange but in reality
05:25 - I don't think that's much of a negative
05:27 - really I guess if you were constantly
05:29 - using it it wouldn't look quite a little
05:31 - bit dystopian but I'm envisioning you
05:33 - put it on you record a nice video of
05:35 - your kids you take it out and you go do
05:37 - normal stuff so it sounds silly but
05:39 - personally I don't think it's much to
05:40 - worry about Apple Vision Pro brings the
05:43 - scale and wonder of a movie theater to
05:46 - whatever space you're in
05:48 - you can make the screen as big as you
05:50 - want yeah so playing videos yeah that
05:52 - sounds great but again something that
05:54 - already exists on pretty much every
05:55 - headset it's definitely an interesting
05:57 - use case for the tech but the one big
05:59 - drawback is if you have a big TV in
06:01 - front of you then multiple people can
06:03 - watch it whereas if you're using this
06:04 - device and pretty much every single
06:06 - person needs to have one which at the
06:07 - current cost that is actually quite
06:08 - expensive
06:10 - Vision Pro is a wonderful way to play
06:13 - your favorite games Curry against smart
06:15 - just connect your controller so it's
06:17 - interesting that they're using a PS5
06:19 - controller usually on things other than
06:21 - pretty much Sony ads usually the Xbox
06:24 - controller is the one that is used so
06:26 - that's definitely an interesting choice
06:28 - and play on a massive screen with
06:31 - Incredible audio
06:33 - and the other obvious thing to note is
06:34 - okay so this is playing flat games it is
06:37 - a mixed reality device so it does both
06:39 - AR and VR however they don't really talk
06:42 - about VR Gaming that much I wonder if
06:44 - that's actually a conscious decision to
06:46 - do that or if that's simply the fact
06:47 - that meta pretty much brought out every
06:49 - single VR studio so they don't really
06:51 - have all kinds of VR content for example
06:53 - beat saber is pretty much the best VR
06:55 - game of all time but it's owned by meta
06:57 - so it will definitely not be on this
06:58 - device Vision Pro you can create the
07:01 - perfect workspace no matter where you
07:03 - are your favorite apps from Apple and
07:06 - the App Store are there
07:09 - you can arrange them however you like
07:12 - and works seamlessly across them
07:15 - being able to actually set up a virtual
07:17 - desktop I do think that is an
07:19 - interesting use case for this deck again
07:20 - especially before the price but would
07:22 - you actually use this as your primary
07:24 - device I can see this being super useful
07:26 - if you're someone who is constantly
07:27 - traveling around so you never have a
07:29 - fixed desktop to play with but if you're
07:30 - always at home would this ever become a
07:32 - primary device this is one of those
07:34 - things where it sounds interesting in
07:35 - theory but in reality I think just
07:36 - having multiple monitors that is so much
07:38 - easier so personally I'm not too sold on
07:40 - this Vision except of course if I were
07:42 - to fly a lot if I was constantly on the
07:44 - road then yep I could see this being
07:46 - very useful and even connect your Mac
07:49 - simply by looking at it
07:51 - turning a 13 inch screen
07:55 - again yet another similar thing and this
07:58 - is quite interesting once again super
07:59 - useful if you're constantly out on the
08:01 - road and you only have a small 15-inch
08:03 - laptop if so I could see this being
08:05 - quite useful to have a much bigger
08:07 - screen but once again my one question
08:09 - that always comes up with anything
08:10 - related to Apple is okay so this is work
08:13 - on other things for me I work on Windows
08:15 - I don't have any Macs so with this
08:17 - actually work paired with a Windows
08:19 - device that's a good question like on a
08:21 - plane
08:23 - yeah so on the plane I do see this being
08:25 - quite useful once again if I follow out
08:27 - this would be very great
08:30 - high performance battery reduces weight
08:32 - to a minimum and slips easily into your
08:36 - pocket
08:37 - so the battery is another really
08:39 - interesting thing previously they
08:40 - mentioned how you could use this to
08:41 - watch movies but the battery only lasts
08:44 - for about two hours and as far as I know
08:46 - nowadays most movies are over two hours
08:48 - so that's another example of how it
08:50 - seems like division is a bit ahead of
08:52 - the tech
08:53 - convincingly Place content in your space
08:56 - took thousands of groundbreaking
08:57 - Innovations and custom Technologies
09:00 - since your eyes see the world with
09:03 - Incredible resolution we built a micro
09:05 - OLED display system that fits 64 pixels
09:08 - in the same amount of space as a single
09:11 - iPhone pixel
09:12 - the resolution does seem quite
09:14 - impressive from some numbers that I saw
09:16 - I believe it's supposed to be in like 3
09:18 - 400 by 3400 so that is quite a lot of
09:20 - pixels So in theory the screen should be
09:22 - really good
09:23 - it's more than a 4K TV for each eye
09:26 - giving you jaw dropping lifelike clarity
09:31 - power a spatial computer like apple
09:33 - Vision Pro required an Innovative dual
09:36 - chip design now that's a really
09:38 - interesting thing I don't think any
09:40 - other even the metaquest pro I don't
09:42 - think it's using multiple chips so I
09:44 - wonder if this is responsible for the
09:45 - super huge price tag having to build two
09:47 - chips instead of just one the results do
09:50 - seem impressive but is it worth the cost
09:51 - I'm not sure
09:53 - M2 provides phenomenal performance and a
09:56 - brand new chip R1 processes sensor data
10:00 - at incredible speed virtually
10:02 - eliminating lag the era of spatial
10:05 - Computing is here
10:07 - this is Apple Vision Pro
10:11 - [Music]
10:14 - now that's interesting so on the
10:16 - official trailer that they separated
10:18 - from the keynote on this one there is no
10:19 - mention of price or anything so I don't
10:22 - know I think that's fun basically costs
10:24 - 3 500 bucks which is quite a lot the
10:26 - tech does seem extremely impressive but
10:28 - the cost is definitely high up there so
10:30 - based on this I would say those people
10:31 - said apple is going to pretty much blow
10:34 - XR and everything is going to change
10:35 - based on that price point I don't think
10:37 - so but in terms of tech it does seem
10:39 - externally good it does seem like a push
10:41 - attack to the absolute limits regardless
10:42 - of price and I guess we shall see if
10:45 - that strategy is going to work or not
10:46 - and yeah it'll be really fun to try out
10:48 - and experience it the first time can't
10:50 - imagine I'd buy one and use it a lot
10:52 - though yeah I would say that's pretty
10:53 - much the exact same thing for me the
10:55 - tech looks really exciting really
10:56 - interesting so based on Tech I
10:58 - definitely would love to try it out but
11:00 - at that cost 3500 bucks that is quite a
11:02 - lot of money so even if I could
11:03 - technically justify it as a business
11:05 - expense if I were to make a video on it
11:07 - even with that that is still way too
11:09 - much that I am willing to spend either
11:11 - way it's only coming out next year so no
11:13 - point in worrying about that right now
11:14 - basically to answer the question title
11:17 - so that Apple change everything related
11:18 - to XR I don't think so simply because
11:21 - the price point people were saying this
11:22 - is going to be the moment where XR is
11:24 - going to become mainstream but obviously
11:26 - at this price point you can't possibly
11:27 - do that so really exciting Tech
11:29 - definitely targets for more developers
11:30 - to build all kinds of apps and who knows
11:33 - perhaps the next iteration will really
11:34 - hit it big either way definitely
11:36 - exciting to see how much the attack is
11:37 - progressing alright I hope you found it
11:39 - interesting to hear my thoughts on this
11:40 - topic let me know if you'd like to see
11:42 - some more videos like this thank you for
11:43 - watching and I'll see you next time
11:46 - foreign
11:49 - [Music]
