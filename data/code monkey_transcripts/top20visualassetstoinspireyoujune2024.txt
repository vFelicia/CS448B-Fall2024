00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your KMI the SSA
00:02 - is full of awesome tools and asss help
00:04 - you make your own games there's more and
00:05 - more awesome visual stuff coming out
00:07 - every month so in this video let's check
00:08 - out some highlights for June 24th even
00:10 - if you don't pick up any of these it's
00:11 - still great to look at them to see if
00:12 - they inspire you to build something just
00:14 - watching some of these assets is enough
00:16 - to fire up my imagination I can
00:17 - immediately picture all the kinds of
00:18 - games that I could build this one is a
00:20 - list of paid ass and effects I've
00:21 - already made two videos covering the
00:23 - best fre new assets and best TOs and
00:24 - systems as always there's links to the
00:26 - ass in the description and as a bonus
00:27 - you can use the coupon code Mony 10 to
00:29 - get 10% off your order quick update on
00:31 - my dots scores after a ton of work
00:33 - building the Prototype after writing
00:34 - basically a small novel I finally
00:36 - started recording the lectures the
00:38 - recording and the editing are usually
00:39 - the fastest stages so I think I'll have
00:41 - the first part ready in about two weeks
00:43 - now I'm saying first part because it
00:44 - turns out this course will actually be
00:46 - quite massive making an RTX is a quite
00:49 - complex genre and adding dots on top of
00:51 - that means there's tons of interesting
00:53 - stuff to teach so I will be publishing
00:55 - the course in Parts as I complete them
00:56 - stay tuned you can sign up on the course
00:58 - page and if you already signed up then
01:00 - I'll send you an email to let you know
01:01 - when the course is out all right so
01:02 - starting off with a really awesome
01:04 - visual effect pack this one looks truly
01:06 - gorgeous some very unique effects you've
01:08 - got a heatwave and some kind of
01:10 - holographic effect alongside multiple
01:12 - variations so this could be some kind of
01:14 - scanner in your game or perhaps some
01:16 - really intense Fire magic spell next if
01:18 - you want to make your game stand out
01:19 - then a shaded effect like this one can
01:21 - really help it adds nice thick outlines
01:23 - to all the edges of your objects again
01:25 - that's all the edges not just the
01:27 - outside edges it is not just an outline
01:29 - effect personally I really love this
01:31 - look it makes it look a lot more
01:32 - stylized so even if you use some common
01:34 - visual assets they will still stand out
01:36 - then here's the latest CTI pack this one
01:38 - is all about the apocalypse Wasteland
01:40 - however wonder if they intentionally
01:42 - time this one to coincide with the
01:43 - latest Mad Max movie it does feature
01:45 - very much that kind of style you've got
01:47 - lots of abandoned highways Rusty
01:49 - vehicles and buildings that have been
01:50 - taken over by Nature it also includes a
01:52 - ton of really unique vehicles built from
01:54 - all kinds of random mechanical parts and
01:56 - it also has a bunch of acid with some
01:58 - goop mutants next for another nice
02:00 - effect here is Umbra this one lets you
02:02 - add better softer directional Shadows by
02:05 - default unity's main light has some
02:07 - pretty hard Shadows even if you set them
02:09 - on soft mode they are still pretty hard
02:11 - whereas this effect this one gives you
02:12 - quite a lot more control for making them
02:14 - look much softer much nicer you can
02:16 - customize the softness based on distance
02:18 - and it's also super easy to set up just
02:20 - add the effect to your renderer and
02:21 - that's it then for some super fun
02:23 - looking effects here is some carfire and
02:25 - explosions it looks really perfect just
02:28 - like you would see on some kind of movie
02:30 - where they place a bomb under the car
02:32 - the explosion is really satisfying going
02:34 - out of the windows and turning into fire
02:36 - the car even jumps up a little bit so
02:38 - like I said perfectly taken exactly as
02:40 - you would see on some kind of Mafia
02:41 - movie Next for a nice animation pack
02:43 - here is one all about Mages it's a
02:45 - really huge pack almost 500 animations
02:48 - that's a lot it's got lots of unique
02:50 - combo attacks with the staff you've got
02:51 - various actions to activate all kinds of
02:53 - skills and it's also got lots of parries
02:55 - and Dodge rolls so this would be perfect
02:57 - for some kind of game inspired by devil
02:59 - mry then then if you want to make giant
03:00 - RPG 2D worlds check out this one it's a
03:03 - complete pack with a ton of tiles you've
03:05 - got ancient ruins you've got sewers a
03:07 - prison Cemetery Crypt and a bunch more
03:10 - it includes both World tiles as well as
03:12 - some characters so with just this one
03:13 - pack you can make a super huge great
03:15 - looking world with lots of unique biomes
03:17 - or if all you want is just a single
03:19 - super high quality character if so check
03:21 - out this one it's a monk very much of
03:23 - the martial arts variety I love the
03:25 - style for this one although apparently
03:26 - this pack does not contain any
03:28 - animations just a gorgeous visual mesh
03:30 - next if you need a simple see-through
03:32 - Shader then here it is it does exactly
03:34 - what it says it keeps your character
03:35 - visible even when included there are
03:37 - various methods to play around with so
03:39 - you can make the occluder object hide
03:40 - itself like just hide the entire object
03:42 - or you can use a nice round see-through
03:44 - area you can make it fade on distance or
03:46 - customize the round see-through shape
03:48 - then if you want to make your own Five
03:50 - Nights at Freddy's here's a pack perfect
03:52 - for exactly that it features some really
03:54 - creepy really spooky animatronics I got
03:56 - to say this is something that always
03:57 - creeps me out I am not a fan of
04:00 - animatronics in general and especially
04:01 - not when they're possessed but if you
04:03 - are if you're making a horror game then
04:04 - this is definitely perfect there's five
04:06 - creepy characters of various animals and
04:08 - if you have creepy characters in your
04:10 - game you probably want to shoot them so
04:12 - if so here's some nice shooting VFX all
04:14 - of them are very very realistic you have
04:16 - muzzle flashes and impact particles
04:18 - there's lots of them lots of muzzle
04:19 - flashes for each individual weapon and
04:21 - for the impact particles it also has
04:23 - lots of them for all kinds of materials
04:25 - so you've got one for wood ceramic metal
04:27 - and so on or if your game is more in
04:28 - feudal Japan then here's a great
04:30 - environment pack these got some
04:32 - excellent looking very realistic assets
04:34 - like seriously these could be taken
04:35 - straight from the game Ghost of sushima
04:37 - it features 400 highquality assets
04:39 - including some modular pieces so you
04:41 - could use them to build your own custom
04:43 - environments or if you're making a nice
04:44 - transort Tycoon sort of game if so
04:46 - here's a nice pack you've got Planes
04:48 - Trains and buzzes so really great for
04:50 - making a nice tycoon game all about
04:52 - transporting people between cities kind

04:55 - really like that game or you can just
04:57 - use the planes for some kind of flying
04:58 - Simulator game next next for some 2D

05:02 - are in a perfect isometric perspective
05:04 - with many sides for the animations
