00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's learn where we can get
00:03 - some free animations and models and
00:05 - learn how to import them into unity now
00:07 - i'm sure a lot of you already know about
00:09 - this website but i'm also sure there's
00:10 - some people that don't know about it so
00:12 - i figured i'd make a quick video
00:14 - the website in question is called maximo
00:16 - this is an awesome completely free
00:18 - website with tons of characters and tons
00:19 - of animations you've got a search bar
00:21 - and you can search from thousands of
00:23 - free animations same thing for the
00:24 - characters all of them free and they are
00:26 - in pretty nice quality and any of these
00:28 - characters can be used with any of these
00:30 - animations not to mention any other
00:32 - humanoid characters or humanoid
00:34 - animations all of them are compatible
00:35 - with each other also by the way this
00:37 - video is not sponsored by miximo it's
00:39 - just a great website that can be very
00:41 - useful to you while making your games
00:42 - and like i said this can also be very
00:44 - useful for combining with things you
00:45 - already have for example a while ago i
00:48 - made a video highlighting the free
00:49 - assets he could get from the asset store
00:51 - the deal is over now but you could get
00:53 - some packs that had tons of characters
00:55 - now if you missed that video because
00:56 - youtube didn't recommend it then maybe
00:58 - go onto the website and set up your
00:59 - account to receive direct emails
01:01 - notifying you when there's a new video
01:03 - that way you won't miss out on these
01:05 - time-sensitive opportunities and you're
01:06 - not dependent on the youtube algorithm
01:08 - choosing what videos you should watch so
01:10 - anyways there was that pack that you
01:11 - could get for free and like i mentioned
01:13 - in the video all of these cinti assets
01:14 - come with a humanoid rig humanoid is
01:17 - just a type that unity has which allows
01:18 - for animation retargeting meaning that
01:21 - you can use a humanoid character
01:22 - combined with any humanoid animation and
01:24 - as it turns out mixomo is full of
01:26 - humanoid and missions as well as
01:28 - humanoid characters so let's first look
01:30 - into how to import free animations and
01:32 - then we're going to see how to import a
01:34 - free character so as an example over
01:36 - here i have a character again this one
01:38 - is from that city pack the character is
01:40 - in a standard t-pose so just a basic
01:43 - mesh character
01:44 - now the first thing is to ensure that
01:46 - the mesh is set up as humanoid so you
01:48 - select the mesh in the project files and
01:50 - over here on the inspector go onto the
01:52 - rig tab and over here under animation
01:54 - type make sure you select humanoid so
01:57 - just do that and hit on apply so that's
01:59 - all you need to do as long as the mesh
02:01 - is rigged with a humanoid rig if not
02:03 - then over here you can also manually
02:04 - define the avatar or copy from another
02:06 - one or click on configure so again if
02:09 - you already set up your mesh as a
02:10 - humanoid rig then all of these will be
02:11 - assigned automatically so you can see
02:13 - all the various joints that make up the
02:15 - humanoid rig and once it is set up as
02:17 - humanoid then it works with any humanoid
02:19 - animation after that you can just go
02:21 - into maximo.com and just log in or sign
02:23 - up with a free account so here it is and
02:26 - now up here you've got two buttons one
02:28 - for animations and one for characters
02:30 - now right now we want the animation so
02:32 - let's go into the animations tab and
02:34 - then just go ahead search for any of
02:35 - these animations so you can see there's
02:37 - tons of them all these and you got a
02:39 - search bar up here you can search for
02:41 - anything you want and there you go lots
02:43 - of interesting animations okay so just
02:45 - go ahead and pick any of these
02:46 - animations like i said these are all
02:48 - humanoids so any of these animations
02:50 - will be compatible with our humanoid
02:51 - character so just pick an animation and
02:54 - then depending on the animation over
02:55 - here on the right side you also have a
02:56 - bunch more parameters so for this one
02:58 - for example there's a parameter for the
03:00 - hit intensity so if i put it real low
03:02 - then just moves a tiny bit if i put it
03:04 - really high then it has a much more
03:06 - intense effect so some of these
03:08 - animations have these parameters so make
03:09 - sure you play around that okay when you
03:11 - got the animation that you want just go
03:13 - ahead click on download and then over
03:14 - here you've got the download settings
03:16 - now for the first one is the format and
03:19 - for this one you can go with fbx for
03:20 - unity then the next one is the skin with
03:23 - or without the skin so if you say yes
03:25 - then this 3d model will be included in
03:27 - the download and if you go without skin
03:30 - then only the animation is included so
03:32 - right now we just want the animation so
03:33 - let's go with that then over here for
03:35 - the frames per second so this is the
03:37 - number of keyframes you can pick
03:39 - whatever you want usually either 30 or
03:41 - 60. either of those won't look good
03:43 - unity then interpolates all the values
03:45 - in between and finally for keyframe
03:47 - reduction so this is if you want your
03:49 - animation file to be compressed if
03:51 - you're making a mobile game then this
03:52 - might be useful to play around to have
03:54 - the final game be really small but for
03:56 - this demo and for pc games pretty much
03:58 - just leave it on none alright so that's
04:00 - it and click on download then just copy
04:03 - paste the file inside the ent assets
04:04 - folder and here it is now even though i
04:07 - did not include the 3d model so i did
04:09 - not include the skin it still comes
04:10 - inside an fbx file so there's an fpx you
04:13 - can expand it and over here you've got
04:14 - the reaction animation so the next step
04:17 - is to select the main file and over here
04:19 - do the exact same thing as a mesh so go
04:20 - on to the wreck tab change it from
04:22 - generic into humanoid just go ahead hit
04:24 - on apply and now this is set up as a
04:26 - humanoid and if you wanted you could
04:28 - just click and drag this reaction
04:30 - animation as you can see it already
04:31 - works like that there's the animation so
04:33 - you could just use this one directly in
04:34 - your animator or you can separate this
04:37 - from this file so just select it and
04:39 - press on ctrl d in order to duplicate it
04:41 - and the duplicated file is outside of
04:43 - the fbx so there you go and over here
04:46 - you've got a phone just with the
04:47 - animation and now we just need to apply
04:49 - this to our character so first select
04:51 - the actual mesh object then you add the
04:53 - animator component and now over here is
04:56 - an extremely important step which is for
04:58 - this to work you need to assign the
05:00 - animator avatar and very very important
05:03 - is this avatar is the avatar for the
05:05 - mesh so over here i've got the mesh for
05:07 - this character and inside i've got the
05:09 - avatar so it is this one that you use
05:11 - and not the one on the animation because
05:13 - over here on the animation that we
05:14 - downloaded we can see that we also have
05:16 - an avatar so it is not this one you use
05:18 - the avatar for the mesh not the
05:20 - animation okay so just make sure you're
05:22 - using that one and then let's just make
05:24 - a new animated controller just assign
05:26 - this one and then double click to open
05:28 - up the animator window and then just
05:30 - click and drag our animation on there
05:32 - there you go it starts off on the start
05:34 - one then we can go back into the scene
05:35 - view select the characters open up the
05:37 - animation window so you can go into
05:39 - window animation open up the animation
05:41 - window so that's this one and over here
05:43 - you can already preview the animation so
05:45 - there you go yep that's the animation
05:46 - that we downloaded and of course just
05:48 - like with any animation you can change a
05:49 - lot of things so for example apply root
05:51 - motion or not and you can go into the
05:53 - animation itself and for example bake
05:55 - that into the pose so just do all the
05:57 - usual things that you can do with any
05:59 - animation alright so here it is our
06:01 - custom humanoid character playing a
06:02 - custom humanoid animation alright
06:05 - awesome okay so these are the steps for
06:07 - downloading a custom animation and using
06:09 - it in unity now let's see how we
06:11 - download an actual character so for that
06:13 - let's go back into maximo then go into
06:15 - the characters tab
06:17 - and then over here just go ahead and
06:18 - pick from any of these characters so for
06:20 - example this really strange boss
06:22 - character now this one is not playing
06:23 - the selected animation if you want you
06:25 - can go over here and click on the close
06:27 - there you go it just goes into the
06:29 - normal t pose okay so that's the
06:31 - characters once again go into download
06:33 - and choose fbx for unity for the pose
06:35 - yep t-pose looks good alright so here
06:37 - i've got the character in unity however
06:40 - if right away you just try to click and
06:41 - drag this one onto the scene and nope
06:43 - you do see the issue and the issue is
06:45 - that it has no textures so you've got
06:47 - the mesh but no textures now they are
06:49 - included in the file but they need to be
06:50 - extracted so just select the file
06:53 - then since we're here we can already go
06:55 - ahead and make it as humanoid okay then
06:57 - go into the materials tab and over here
06:59 - we've got two buttons to extract
07:01 - materials and the textures so let's
07:03 - extract the materials then just pick a
07:05 - folder and select it there you go over
07:07 - here you see all the various materials
07:09 - now we need the texture so same thing
07:11 - just go up here extract the textures
07:13 - and up here we've got all the materials
07:15 - and all the textures
07:16 - now i just need to assign them so all
07:17 - these use the same texture so just
07:19 - select them all drag the diffuse onto
07:21 - the diffuse map onto the base map then
07:24 - the normal go into the normal map then
07:25 - also this one is not marked as normal so
07:28 - just fix it there you go already looks
07:30 - good and finally this one has a specular
07:32 - map so just go with that one like that
07:34 - and yep just like that now it looks
07:35 - correct so we've got our custom mesh as
07:38 - well as the custom materials and
07:39 - textures now once again it's the exact
07:41 - same thing for using this one with the
07:43 - same animations so we already saved it
07:45 - as humanoid so the mesh is marked as
07:46 - humanoid and over here again on the
07:48 - animator make sure you're using the
07:49 - avatar from this one there you go the
07:52 - boss avatar okay and now you can use
07:54 - this with any animation so for example
07:55 - we don't even need the new animator
07:57 - controller just use the exact same one
07:59 - and just go into the animation and there
08:00 - you go now we've got our custom
08:01 - character playing our custom animation
08:03 - so yep there it is as you can see this
08:05 - website is super useful with tons of
08:07 - only free characters and free animations
08:10 - so the next time you start working on a
08:11 - prototype go here and download a nice
08:13 - model with some nice animations to make
08:15 - your game look great alright hope that's
08:17 - useful check out these videos to learn
08:18 - some more thanks to these awesome
08:20 - patreon supporters for making these
08:22 - videos possible thank you for watching
08:24 - and i'll see you next time
