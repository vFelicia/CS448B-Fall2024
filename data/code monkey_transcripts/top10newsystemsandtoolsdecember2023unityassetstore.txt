00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod Maki the
00:02 - asset is full of awesome tools and
00:04 - assets to help you make your run games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - December 23 this one is the list of paid
00:11 - systems and tools in the last video I'll
00:13 - already covered the best free new assets
00:14 - and next one I'll cover top visuals and
00:16 - effect as always there's links to the in
00:17 - description as a bonus you can use the
00:19 - coupon code Mony 10 to get 10% off your
00:20 - order by the way my own game is
00:22 - currently discounted as part of the
00:24 - steam holiday sale so if you wanted to
00:26 - try it out then now is your chance and
00:28 - speaking of assets previously I talked
00:29 - about the assets that I Ed to make the
00:31 - game and right now Unity is having their
00:33 - new year sale and if you want you can
00:35 - pick up a bunch of these on discount you
00:37 - can go look at my character
00:38 - customization system and pick up the
00:40 - character's asset this is the one that I
00:41 - use in the game and the one that I use
00:42 - in that system the quantum console is
00:44 - super useful for helping you debug and
00:46 - do tons of things then this asset adds
00:48 - some really nice effects that make
00:49 - everything look gorgeous I use umotion
00:51 - Pro to make a bunch of custom animations
00:52 - directly inside Unity this nice
00:54 - animation pack that I use so many times
00:56 - and the equival Shader this is the main
00:58 - Shader that I use to make the game look
00:59 - really nice really anime like then feel
01:01 - is obviously excellent text and met is
01:03 - one of the best ways to add that extra
01:05 - bit of Polish to your games and for the
01:07 - CTI assets they're actually all also on
01:09 - sale on the cinti store so if you like
01:11 - their low poly sound definitely give it
01:12 - a look check out all the links in the
01:14 - description all right so starting off
01:16 - with a really interesting tool for
01:17 - easily manipulating your objects
01:19 - sometimes when rotating something it can
01:21 - get quite tricky because it always
01:23 - rotates around the pivot which usually
01:24 - is in the center with this tool you can
01:26 - set a custom pivot like for example on
01:28 - an edge on a vertex and then you can
01:30 - rotate or scale directly from that point
01:33 - this is a tiny thing but it's something
01:34 - that is really helpful if you need it
01:36 - like for example if you have a tree and
01:38 - for some reason the model pivot is in
01:39 - the middle of the trunk with this you
01:41 - can easily place it on the bottom to
01:43 - scale and rotate it or for example if
01:45 - you have some kind of chest and you want
01:46 - to open it exactly where the INE would
01:48 - be if so you can easily snap the pivot
01:50 - to a vertex and move it anywhere
01:52 - importantly is this is not actually
01:54 - modify the original pivot it is still
01:56 - wherever it was originally this
01:57 - basically does a bunch of complex math
01:59 - in the the background to make it seem
02:01 - like the pivot changed without actually
02:02 - changing it really useful really tiny
02:04 - tool then one problem that I'm sure
02:06 - you've encountered is missing scripts
02:08 - here's a tool to help with that if you
02:10 - move or rename or delete a script any
02:12 - game object that had that script attach
02:14 - as a component will just say missing
02:16 - script it's really not very helpful how
02:18 - it doesn't actually say what script it
02:19 - was so you can end up with tons of
02:21 - missing scripts and no idea exactly what
02:23 - it's missing this is a very simple tool
02:25 - that helps solve exactly that it tells
02:27 - you the name of the script and where it
02:28 - was the last time it was seeing from
02:30 - what I understand this tool basically
02:31 - creates a Tracker so if you import it
02:33 - onto a project that has missing scripts
02:35 - you won't be able to help it needs to be
02:37 - there from the start but it also seems
02:38 - to integrate well with Git so if you
02:40 - have Source control it may work great
02:42 - either way this is an excellent tiny
02:43 - potentially very useful tool next here's
02:46 - a topic that I've wanted to research for
02:47 - quite some time it's a tool for
02:49 - exporting from unreal into Unity now
02:51 - there are lots of humble bundles all the
02:53 - time and some of them have some gorgeous
02:55 - and real assets and assets are really
02:57 - just assets so there's really no reason
02:59 - why they would be fix to a particular
03:00 - engine you can grab in real assets and
03:02 - take them to Unity or vice versa but
03:04 - while the meshes and textures those are
03:06 - just regular Universal files from what I
03:09 - understand the materials do require some
03:10 - manual work to convert that's the topic
03:12 - that I'd like to research but if you
03:14 - just want a One clict tool then this one
03:16 - seems perfect you load this plugin into
03:18 - a simple Andre project then load some
03:20 - assets into un real then you can simply
03:23 - press a button and this will create a
03:24 - Unity project with all those assets and
03:26 - all the materials and all the shaders
03:28 - all correctly loaded very useful if
03:30 - there are some unreal assets you'd like
03:31 - to try I definitely need to try this out
03:34 - next for something to help you with some
03:35 - gameplay here's a tool for helping you
03:37 - drag slide and rotate this is perfect
03:39 - for helping you quickly make all kinds
03:41 - of adventure games those usually involve
03:43 - lots of tiny interactions it lets you
03:45 - make any object interactable with a
03:47 - variety of interactions you can set up a
03:49 - key to rotate with an angle limit that
03:51 - automatically opens the door you can set
03:53 - up the door to be pullable from one side
03:55 - until the limit you can play with gears
03:57 - you can open some drawers push p pull
03:59 - turn drag drop and really just about any
04:02 - interaction you can think of Adventure
04:03 - and horror games are usually pretty much
04:05 - about all of these kinds of interactions
04:07 - so if you'd like to make a game like
04:08 - those a system like this can really
04:10 - massively speed up that kind of
04:11 - development then here's an interesting
04:13 - codebase tool called The Binding system
04:15 - this one lets you take any Fields you
04:17 - have and basically link them to some
04:18 - value for example you can have a car
04:20 - with engine script and you can have a
04:22 - custom script that listens you player
04:23 - input and then set some float with some
04:26 - speed amount normally you would then
04:28 - from that script call some kind of
04:29 - function on the engine and set the value
04:31 - however with this toel you can kind of
04:32 - do the reverse you can mark the car
04:34 - engine parameter as bindable and then
04:36 - bind it from the other custom play
04:38 - script to that function so basically it
04:39 - is a reverse instead of having your
04:41 - custom input tell the engine how to move
04:43 - instead of that the engine grabs the
04:45 - value from whatever is bound to that
04:46 - variable this can be really helpful to
04:48 - make your games much more designer Focus
04:50 - since you can link lots of custom logic
04:52 - very easily directly in the editor
04:54 - without having to touch any code you can
04:56 - bind to literally anything not just
04:57 - custom functions it can be any any
04:59 - exposed property or any script including
05:01 - all of the built-in components like for
05:03 - example a standard UI slider you can
05:05 - make the engine script bound to the
05:06 - slider value no code required super easy
05:09 - this is definitely very unique very
05:10 - interesting tool especially if you're
05:12 - the kind of person who likes to connect
05:13 - all your logic in the editor instead of
05:14 - through code next if you'd like to make
05:16 - a game kind of like Gang Beast here's a
05:18 - great complete template importantly this
05:20 - is an online enabled template that's
05:22 - what makes this one really stand out
05:24 - when working with physics making it
05:26 - online is always really tricky so that
05:27 - really is the important feature of this
05:29 - template
05:30 - this one is built using miror networking
05:32 - the characters are all very wobbly and
05:33 - perfectly synchronized in multiplayer
05:35 - you can attack your opponents you can
05:37 - grab them and throw objects all with
05:39 - lots of tiny physics all perfectly
05:40 - synchronized so this one basically has
05:42 - all the features you expect from these
05:44 - kinds of games so if you'd like to build
05:45 - one then this would be a great starting
05:47 - point then if you're a fan of the
05:49 - blender ability to subdivide meshes and
05:51 - you'd like to do that directly inside
05:52 - Unity if so here's a great tool it does
05:54 - exactly that you basically take a mesh
05:57 - any mesh and it automatically subdivides
05:59 - that mesh to make it a lot more rounded
06:01 - a lot more smooth since nowadays a lot
06:02 - of games are using in low poly style
06:04 - perhaps applying this fuel to some low
06:06 - poly assets can make it unique enough to
06:07 - stand out surprisingly this appears to
06:10 - work well on regular meshes as well as
06:12 - also on skin meshes so you could
06:14 - definitely also apply this to a bunch of
06:15 - characters naturally there are potential
06:17 - concerns with regards to the max number
06:19 - of polygons but if your scenes aren't
06:20 - too huge then this could work and could
06:22 - make your game look quite a bit more
06:24 - interesting quite a bit more unique or
06:25 - maybe you need something to help you
06:27 - generate the world if so look at this
06:29 - one this uses a lot of procedural
06:31 - generation to help you generate huge
06:32 - worlds it also matches different parts
06:34 - together as tiles it looks really easy
06:36 - to use just a handful of parameters and
06:38 - you already have a really nice looking
06:40 - world or you can dive deep and modify
06:42 - every single thing to get exactly the
06:43 - world that you want you can generate
06:45 - mountains River Seas islands and really
06:47 - anything then if you'd like to record a
06:49 - gameplay session check out this tool
06:51 - importantly this is not a video tool it
06:54 - does not record video instead it
06:56 - requires inputs actions and positions
06:58 - this way you can easily scrub through
07:00 - the timeline back and forth this is
07:01 - excellent whenever you encounter some
07:03 - kind of bug and you need to reproduce it
07:05 - if you did record the inputs that let to
07:07 - the bug that can make it really helpful
07:08 - in order to record you really just add a
07:10 - recordable component then select all the
07:12 - various fields that You' like to record
07:14 - you can record Properties or fields or
07:16 - even events and then that data is saved
07:18 - onto a regular CSV file which you can
07:20 - then play back during gameplay next if
07:22 - you've seen those TVs that take the
07:24 - color of whatever's on screen and apply
07:26 - to some LEDs in the back if so then this
07:28 - tool does pretty much that you can
07:29 - select a position in the world and it
07:31 - will constantly sample that color then
07:33 - you can use that color for whatever you
07:34 - want like for example tinting the UI or
07:36 - some text it looks really easy to use
07:38 - just attach the component to whatever
07:40 - transform exists in the world then just
07:42 - play around with all the various
07:43 - parameters you can clamp the color you
07:45 - can modify the saturation and a bunch
07:47 - more things that honestly I'm really not
07:48 - too familiar with because I don't know
07:50 - much about color theory but you do have
07:52 - quite a lot of control over exactly how
07:53 - the color is simpled this one is
07:55 - certainly a very unique thing but
07:56 - something that might help your game feel
07:58 - a bit more dynamic for example you can
08:00 - add some clamping and make it a very
08:01 - subtle effect make your UI suddenly
08:03 - darker when inside a dungeon and then
08:05 - slightly lighter when outside all right
08:07 - so those are my top 10 new tools and
08:09 - systems on the unts store for December
