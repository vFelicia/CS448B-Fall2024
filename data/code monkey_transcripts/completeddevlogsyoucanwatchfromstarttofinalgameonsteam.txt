00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - one of the video types that lots of
00:03 - people like to watch my something
00:04 - included are some devlogs it's always
00:06 - fun to watch a quick video to see
00:08 - someone building their game week by week
00:10 - however just like with tv shows
00:12 - sometimes you just want to wait until
00:13 - it's over and binge the entire series so
00:15 - in this video let's check out three game
00:16 - devlogs that start from nothing and
00:18 - already have been completed with the
00:19 - final game of alban's theme also this
00:22 - video is sponsored by yunti which is
00:23 - currently having a best off sale on the
00:25 - assessor tons of the best assets are
00:28 - currently discounted everything from
00:29 - gorgeous visuals to some awesome tools
00:31 - and systems
00:32 - in fact almost everything that i've
00:34 - previously reviewed is currently on sale
00:36 - i can highly recommend the odin
00:37 - inspector if you want to build tools to
00:39 - improve your productivity
00:41 - the a star pathfinding project this one
00:43 - is an insanely fast pathfinding system
00:45 - that i've used in pretty much all of my
00:47 - steam games
00:48 - the all-in-one sprite shader for making
00:49 - your sprites look awesome also feel
00:52 - which is really awesome for adding that
00:53 - last bit of polish to your games so if
00:55 - you're interested in any of those you
00:56 - can go watch my phone reviews on those
00:58 - assets to see how they work and then
01:00 - browse the store to see everything that
01:02 - is currently on sale check it out to the
01:03 - link in description alright so let's
01:05 - look at some devlogs and before i get to
01:07 - the first game let me quickly mention my
01:09 - own when i first started this channel i
01:10 - was already hard at work on what
01:12 - eventually became battle round tycoon i
01:14 - did some tutorial videos on various
01:16 - systems that i was working on the game i
01:17 - made a series on the waiting qai on the
01:19 - graph the guest spreadsheets and the
01:21 - pre-complex task system
01:23 - so those are based on what would become
01:25 - a steam game but their tutorials are not
01:27 - devlogs although near the end just
01:29 - before release i did do some more
01:30 - standard dev vlogs one of them
01:32 - implementing money and a restaurant
01:34 - adding some really interesting vips to
01:36 - the game adding some trading cards just
01:38 - before release and finally after release
01:40 - i also made a video sharing my revenue
01:42 - stats so that's my own contribution to
01:44 - the dev vlog genre whenever i start
01:46 - working on my next steam game i will
01:47 - definitely be doing a full series from
01:49 - start to finish so stay tuned for that
01:51 - [Music]
01:56 - all right so on to the complete devlogs
01:58 - let's start off with one of the most
02:00 - popular ones and one of the original
02:01 - ones here is the game equivalenox which
02:04 - has devlogs in the channel thin matrix
02:06 - the final game is a huge massive success
02:08 - it's got over 2 000 very positive
02:11 - reviews so people really love the game
02:13 - this one is definitely top one percent
02:15 - in the game in terms of results so it's
02:16 - really awesome that the entire dev
02:18 - journey is on video when i said this is
02:20 - one of the original ones i really meant
02:21 - it
02:22 - there is a playlist with 125 videos and
02:25 - the very first one came out in 2015 and
02:27 - the final game released in 2018 and
02:30 - actually before that he was already
02:31 - experimenting with java and opengl since
02:33 - 2013. the game is built on a custom java
02:36 - engine he was previously working on an
02:38 - action mmo and then changed gears to
02:40 - work on what eventually became equilinox
02:42 - the very first episode already shows a
02:44 - terrain prototype with some trees and
02:46 - animals it's surprisingly close to the
02:48 - final game he describes the game as a
02:50 - sandbox with various rooms like sheep
02:52 - and grass wildcats eating sheep and so
02:54 - on it's a game all about balancing an
02:56 - ecosystem and balancing biomes so from
02:58 - the very beginning the general idea of
03:00 - the game was already very solid after a
03:02 - few devlogs on episode 15 we get to see
03:04 - how design is becoming more and more
03:06 - detailed
03:07 - in this dev vlog he also covers how he
03:09 - made a great season for the game
03:10 - splitting the world into various weird
03:12 - positions so by doing that it is much
03:15 - more performant for each entity to
03:16 - interact with nearby entities without
03:18 - having to check distance against every
03:20 - single entity this episode also talks
03:22 - about the evolution mechanic so how
03:24 - animals breed and how various traits
03:26 - increase their chance for survival which
03:28 - in turn increased the prominence of that
03:30 - trait he made a really nice visual test
03:32 - where he made a trait based on color so
03:34 - she parspawned and the more red they are
03:36 - the better the chance of survival
03:38 - it's a simple mechanic but it's really
03:40 - fun to see the evolution in action very
03:42 - visually after a while all the sheep are
03:44 - pretty much completely red so it's
03:45 - really nice to look at
03:47 - then jumping ahead to episode 48 we see
03:50 - already quite a lot of changes the game
03:52 - now has some post processing it's got
03:54 - various animations lots more systems and
03:56 - mechanics
03:57 - this one is one and a half years after
03:59 - the first episode
04:00 - and actually this is a fun episode
04:02 - because he mentions rebuilding the
04:03 - entire game engine this is one of the
04:06 - interesting pitfalls of building your
04:07 - own engine making an engine is an
04:09 - extremely difficult extremely complex
04:11 - process
04:12 - so by building it yourself chances are
04:14 - you're going to miss something some
04:16 - engine feature that you will eventually
04:17 - learn about as you build more and more
04:19 - of your complex game this game is an
04:21 - example of a very talented very skilled
04:23 - developer that managed to make a
04:25 - successful game with a custom engine
04:27 - however for most people i would
04:28 - definitely now recommend that path
04:30 - doing a custom engine and doing it
04:32 - properly with all of these features
04:34 - doing that is extremely difficult so
04:36 - generally you have to ask yourself do
04:38 - you want to build an engine or a game
04:39 - you can't really do both this is one of
04:41 - the extremely rare occasions where it
04:43 - actually worked doing both at this point
04:45 - the game now has a currency it has
04:47 - points which you can gain by achieving
04:49 - tasks and spend on upgrades for new
04:51 - animals and fauna there is also now a
04:53 - growing system in the game so the points
04:55 - are off small and grow over time while
04:56 - also changing their visual look and the
04:58 - task system also now has a prerequisite
05:01 - system which has a nice progression to
05:02 - the game you can place animals to
05:04 - complete tasks gain resources with some
05:06 - more tasks then spend those resources to
05:09 - unlock more animals and so on so the
05:11 - core gameplan loop is already very well
05:13 - established by this point
05:14 - jumping ahead to an episode titled
05:16 - planning for release which was about two
05:18 - months before the final release
05:20 - this is another interesting episode
05:22 - because it covers lots of things that
05:23 - are absolutely essential to releasing a
05:25 - game but if you've never gone through
05:27 - the whole process going until the very
05:29 - end and releasing a game if you haven't
05:31 - done that then you might not know much
05:32 - about this part of the process
05:34 - he starts off by listing all the things
05:36 - that still need doing making a website
05:38 - preparing all of the images and captions
05:40 - getting the trailer done setting
05:42 - everything up on seems backend and of
05:43 - course announcing a proper release date
05:46 - also of course fixing lots of tiny bugs
05:48 - thankfully since he started doing the
05:50 - devlogs for such a long time he managed
05:52 - to get a nice amount of people
05:53 - interested in playing the game and
05:54 - essentially being bug testers
05:57 - if you're a solo developer then this
05:58 - kind of help is definitely extremely
06:00 - valuable everyone plays games in
06:02 - different ways so you yourself cannot
06:04 - possibly ever find all of the bugs then
06:06 - finally the video announcing the release
06:08 - of the game three years after the very
06:10 - first episode this one is a huge
06:12 - milestone for any developers and he even
06:14 - mentions that thankfully the game did
06:16 - much better than expected both in terms
06:17 - of sales and reviews but more
06:20 - importantly right after release a very
06:22 - important thing that again if you've
06:23 - never taken a game to release you might
06:24 - not know about which is post launch
06:26 - support and updates you might think that
06:28 - the second the game is out the work is
06:29 - done but that is far from the case
06:32 - release is just another milestone and
06:33 - after that things can become even more
06:35 - hectic it all depends on how much
06:37 - testing and bug fixing you did before
06:39 - release and if you do manage to have a
06:41 - successful release you're also going to
06:43 - have tons of people suggesting ideas and
06:45 - asking for more and more post launch
06:46 - content so after release there's still a
06:48 - bunch of videos all of them covering
06:50 - post launch content so that's the
06:52 - development of equinox 126 episodes and
06:55 - three years to go from nothing to a
06:57 - final c release and thankfully the final
06:59 - scene release did have massive success
07:02 - so thank you all so much thanks for
07:04 - coming on this journey with me and i am
07:06 - very much looking forward to whatever
07:08 - happens next
07:09 - [Music]
07:14 - for the second complete devlog let's
07:16 - take a look at the dreadful whispers by
07:18 - blackthorne prawn this one was 22
07:20 - devlogs over nine months starting with
07:23 - the first devlog title starting a new
07:25 - game project in unity at this point the
07:27 - game was already in development for
07:28 - about a month so all the basics are
07:30 - there
07:31 - the first episode goes over the design
07:32 - the game and the various mechanics that
07:34 - it has the game is a 2d puzzle
07:36 - platformer where you control multiple
07:38 - characters and the world has different
07:39 - platforms where each can jump on very
07:42 - important to this poisson platformer
07:43 - genre is a nice mix of mechanics and
07:45 - varied levels so from the very first
07:47 - episode he was already experimenting
07:49 - with testing all kinds of mechanics to
07:51 - test them and see which ones fit the
07:52 - final game
07:54 - remember that you should always iterate
07:55 - upon your games and at the same time
07:57 - don't be afraid to throw away something
07:59 - that doesn't work so experiment build
08:01 - some new mechanics and if they fit your
08:03 - game keep them if not let them go also
08:06 - noah is primarily an artist so that is
08:08 - why the very first devlog on radio looks
08:10 - so close to the final game jumping ahead
08:12 - to episode number five this one is all
08:14 - about cut scenes and the process that he
08:16 - went through to turn them from photoshop
08:17 - to reality
08:19 - it's a great example of how you can use
08:20 - any tool at your disposal to achieve the
08:22 - final result in this case he decided to
08:24 - make the cutscenes using a regular video
08:26 - editor program
08:27 - then just using the video player
08:29 - component to play those cut scenes
08:30 - directly inside unity
08:32 - so this is always one approach that you
08:33 - have instead of building the cutscenes
08:35 - as actual animations inside the engine
08:38 - another interesting thing in this
08:39 - episode is when the final name the
08:41 - dreadful whispers is announced
08:43 - so for your own games don't worry about
08:45 - coming up with the name or the perfect
08:46 - name right from the beginning go ahead
08:48 - and build a nice prototype and design
08:50 - your game start playing out and testing
08:52 - your ideas your name can wait until a
08:54 - bit later then episode 11 is a very
08:56 - important one it's titled trying to
08:58 - become a healthy game developer game
09:00 - development and especially solo game
09:02 - development is a very taxing thing
09:04 - and when you add on top of that the
09:06 - usual issues with social media
09:07 - especially if you're also trying to
09:09 - create content around your game and
09:10 - constantly changing stats when you put
09:12 - all that together it can be very easy to
09:14 - end up completely burnt out
09:16 - so for one month he decided to do a
09:18 - little social media detox basically
09:20 - waking up and doing game dev or going
09:21 - for a run or anything other than
09:23 - instantly checking twitter and youtube
09:25 - so the takeaway from this video is game
09:27 - dev is a marathon it's not a sprint
09:29 - don't burn yourself out by constantly
09:30 - pushing like crazy definitely go ahead
09:32 - and push hard to achieve your goal but
09:34 - not so much that you go past your limits
09:37 - i must say this is one thing that i
09:38 - personally only have somewhat figured
09:40 - out i definitely value physical exercise
09:42 - very highly and i try to only use social
09:44 - media in a limited way just for working
09:46 - but i still have the thing where i
09:48 - regularly work way too much so if you're
09:50 - having trouble with managing a good
09:52 - work-life balance all i can say is keep
09:54 - at it it's definitely not an easy task i
09:56 - have trouble with it myself but always
09:57 - keep trying
09:58 - jumping ahead to episode 19 and this one
10:01 - is the last week before release
10:03 - and it seems that he learned quite a lot
10:04 - from that episode on taking a break and
10:06 - taking things a bit more slowly he
10:08 - planned enough time for release so we
10:10 - didn't have to crunch like crazy this
10:12 - final week this is the time to make sure
10:14 - that everything is ready you start
10:15 - sending out some steam keys try
10:17 - increasing wish list as much as possible
10:19 - and encourage people to pick up the game
10:21 - at launch and leave a review since
10:22 - reviews are so powerful both in terms of
10:24 - the steam algorithm as well as for your
10:27 - own growth as a game developer to learn
10:28 - what you did well and what you can
10:30 - improve so as a player if you want to
10:32 - help out some in developer definitely
10:34 - leave a review on their steam game and
10:35 - as a developer definitely encourage your
10:37 - players to leave steam reviews
10:39 - i made a quick video on how the steam
10:41 - review buckets actually work if you want
10:42 - to learn more about that
10:44 - and then on the very last episode in the
10:46 - playlist this one is all about stats
10:48 - so if you're working on a puzzle
10:49 - platformer which is an extremely crowded
10:51 - genre very difficult genre definitely go
10:53 - ahead and look at the stats to see how
10:55 - much you can expect
10:57 - [Music]
11:01 - all right so on to the third complete
11:03 - devlog this one is sapiens which has
11:06 - just launched into early access pretty
11:07 - recently the game is a colony survival
11:10 - sim that started development all the way
11:12 - back in 2015 there are 60 developed
11:15 - episodes over the seven years of
11:16 - development this one is similar to
11:19 - equinox in that it's a developer making
11:21 - a custom engine so the very first
11:23 - episode is showcasing a nice custom
11:25 - terrain engine it supports a huge open
11:28 - world
11:29 - it already looks pre-optimized as you
11:31 - zoom in closer and closer you get more
11:33 - and more detail the atmosphere effect
11:35 - looks insanely cool really nice shaders
11:37 - but at this point this is just a terrain
11:39 - engine it's not really a game and from
11:41 - the voice over he didn't start with the
11:43 - intention of making a game just building
11:45 - a prototype for fun
11:46 - he even says quote i don't know if this
11:48 - will ever turn into anything jumping
11:50 - ahead to episode number 10 titled we
11:52 - have a name ambience which you might
11:54 - have noticed is not sapiens so that's a
11:57 - clue for how development of this game
11:59 - changed massively over the many years
12:01 - at this point the design of the game was
12:03 - still more about the terrain and biomes
12:05 - rather than a colony management game
12:07 - still lots of iteration with the
12:09 - detailed generation logic trying to make
12:10 - it more and more seamless the warden
12:12 - looks really nice really fancy shader
12:15 - but again still very far from what the
12:16 - final game would eventually become
12:18 - jumping ahead to episode number 23 and
12:20 - we already see quite a lot of mechanics
12:22 - that closely resemble the final game and
12:25 - we also get the first announcement of
12:26 - the final name sapiens
12:28 - at this point the game was indeed about
12:30 - colony management so there are colonists
12:32 - they can gather wood fruit and other
12:34 - materials you could order them to go
12:36 - somewhere they could research new tech
12:38 - there's also the nice mechanic about
12:40 - which village to start with they are
12:42 - randomly placed in the random world and
12:44 - you can pick one that you want to lead
12:46 - that's a pretty fun unique mechanic for
12:48 - a game like this
12:49 - giving the player a bit more agency over
12:51 - exactly where they want to start
12:53 - the minis were obviously still very
12:55 - early as were a lot of the visuals but
12:57 - at this point the final game was
12:58 - actually starting to take shape jumping
13:00 - ahead quite a bit to episode number 41
13:02 - and we have some nice gameplay this was
13:05 - still two and a half years before
13:06 - release but at this point the game was
13:08 - definitely taking shape
13:10 - there was nice menus lots of actions
13:12 - that the units could take you could
13:13 - plant some trees and they had their own
13:15 - life cycle starting off as a simple
13:17 - sapling before growing into a full tree
13:19 - all the sapiens walked around they had
13:21 - animations for their various actions
13:24 - at this point he was still experimenting
13:26 - with various mechanics like what happens
13:27 - when a sapiens doesn't get enough food
13:29 - so do they get angry or do they leave
13:31 - the tribe
13:32 - still wondering exactly how new sapiens
13:34 - would join the tribe how often women
13:36 - would get pregnant and so on so still
13:38 - quite a lot of design questions
13:40 - unanswered iterating upon your various
13:42 - ideas is a great way to get some answers
13:44 - jumping ahead to episode number 55 and
13:46 - alpha testing has begun however this one
13:49 - is still over one year before the
13:50 - eventual release lots more variation
13:52 - with the visuals there's bloom post
13:54 - processing everything looks really nice
13:56 - and shiny lots more polishing lots of
13:59 - bug fixing work on ui and ux
14:01 - so exactly the kind of things you should
14:03 - be doing just before making your very
14:04 - first public build and for the final
14:07 - episode at the time that i'm recording
14:08 - this episode number 60 you can finally
14:10 - play the game it's out now on steam
14:12 - early access and the game is seeing
14:14 - quite a lot of success
14:15 - already has over 300 very positive
14:18 - reviews in just one week extremely
14:20 - impressive results so this is one
14:22 - example where a big gamble of working
14:23 - for seven years on a single game seems
14:25 - to have paid off
14:27 - although personally i definitely would
14:28 - not recommend that you follow this path
14:30 - which you see here making a game on a
14:32 - custom engine over seven years and
14:34 - finding some massive success this is the
14:36 - exception it's not the rule
14:38 - but that's the story of this game so far
14:40 - it's only just now hit early x's so this
14:42 - story is continuing since the game is
14:44 - selling very very well who knows how
14:46 - many more years and how big the final
14:48 - game will end up being i definitely look
14:50 - forward to playing it in a couple of
14:51 - years
14:55 - [Music]
15:08 - all right so those are three complete
15:10 - devlogs you can now go watch and binge
15:12 - from start to finish and then go play
15:13 - the complete games on scene this was a
15:16 - pretty fun video to research looking at
15:18 - all the devlogs that exist and see how
15:19 - many games made it to the finish line
15:21 - there's a bunch of devlog series that
15:23 - start and never finish but quite a bunch
15:25 - of them actually made it to the finish
15:26 - line there were a bunch more that i
15:28 - found out but the video is already
15:29 - pretty long with just three examples so
15:31 - like this video and let me know in the
15:32 - comments if you'd like to see some more
15:34 - complete devlogs and don't forget to
15:36 - check out the sale on the asset store
15:37 - alright hope that's useful check out
15:39 - these videos to learn some more thanks
15:41 - to these awesome patreon supporters for
15:43 - making these videos possible thank you
15:45 - for watching and i'll see you next time
15:51 - [Music]
15:55 - you
