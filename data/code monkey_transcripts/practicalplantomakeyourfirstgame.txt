00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - so here's a quick video on a program
00:03 - plan you can follow to publish your very
00:05 - first game now the idea for this video
00:07 - actually came from a comment that I saw
00:08 - it's on the video where I talk about
00:10 - seven Game Dev mistakes that can destroy
00:11 - your games which by the way the video
00:13 - has chapters in case you want to jump
00:14 - into each of those mistakes so here's
00:16 - the interesting comment by Callum which
00:18 - says start working on my first game
00:20 - after finishing your kitchen chaos
00:21 - tutorial about a week ago in case you
00:23 - don't know kitchen chaos is my free
00:24 - complete 10 hour course it's great for
00:26 - beginners and even for more intermittent
00:28 - users and then I've watched many videos
00:30 - from Jason Wyman and yourself so I have
00:32 - the idea of starting with some simpler
00:33 - Games first hammered into my brain
00:35 - planning to get this first one done by
00:37 - the time the next infest comes around
00:38 - and here by the way I do think this is
00:40 - an excellent very practical plan for
00:42 - your first proper game keep it extremely
00:44 - simple something that you can make in
00:45 - about two months participate in the Sim
00:47 - festival and then launch the game as for
00:49 - myself I participated in the atlassian
00:51 - festival with my own upcoming Sim game
00:52 - thingy Gardens like I said my reply go
00:55 - for it the plan does sound great make a
00:57 - game until October release a demo on the
00:58 - next fast spend the money month
01:00 - afterwards improving the game based on
01:02 - demo feedback and release in November or
01:03 - December if you follow that you will
01:05 - learn a ton one thing that I've
01:06 - mentioned a bunch of times is how
01:07 - finishing games is actually a skill
01:09 - anyone can learn how to make games and
01:11 - anyone can start making any game but
01:13 - taking it to the Finish Line is another
01:14 - skill entirely and it's one that just
01:16 - like with any other skill you gain with
01:17 - experience a lot of people think that
01:19 - just starting games is enough so they
01:21 - have dozens of Unfinished prototypes
01:22 - with nothing really complete now I truly
01:24 - believe that one of the best things that
01:25 - ever happened to me was sort of randomly
01:27 - which is how I started working with
01:29 - flash and the way the flash gaming scene
01:30 - worked that was all about small
01:32 - extremely small focused games so in the
01:34 - five years that I was making Flash games
01:36 - I finished about 40 complete games and
01:38 - then I had dozens more of Unfinished
01:40 - prototypes I truly think that experience
01:42 - was extremely valuable completing all of
01:44 - these games really taught me how to
01:45 - finish games and finish that skill that
01:47 - is why my advice to people is both start
01:49 - and finish games don't just keep making
01:51 - unfinished prototypes if you do then you
01:53 - will simply never learn all the skills
01:54 - that are required to actually finish a
01:56 - game all the things that only come up on
01:57 - the final stage things like Polish
01:59 - option menu save systems localization
02:02 - input methods working with the steam
02:03 - backend or really just learning how to
02:05 - create satisfying endings for your games
02:06 - if you never take a project to
02:08 - completion then you never go through all
02:09 - these steps then the other thing that
02:11 - can't mentioned that I very much agree
02:12 - with is participating in the steam
02:14 - nextfest this one is coming out in
02:16 - October participating in the festival is
02:18 - something that is absolutely essential
02:19 - nowadays if you want to find success you
02:21 - need to worry about marketing and a
02:23 - crucial marketing step nowadays is
02:24 - similarly participating in a steam
02:25 - Festival once again going through this
02:27 - tab this is going to teach you a lot you
02:28 - won't get your first taste of family
02:30 - feedback which is both a great and a
02:31 - terrible thing learning to listen to
02:33 - feedback and be able to identify what
02:35 - are the things that you should pay
02:36 - attention to and learning how to
02:37 - withstand Sometimes some very harsh
02:39 - criticism learning that is yet another
02:40 - extremely valuable skill that you
02:42 - definitely must gain and once again you
02:43 - only have the opportunity to develop
02:45 - this skill if you take a project to
02:46 - completion so if you're the kind of
02:48 - person who tends to get stuck in
02:49 - analysis paralysis then here's a very
02:51 - simple very practical plan that you can
02:53 - follow and before we get to the actual
02:55 - plan if you need any assets to make your
02:56 - first game thankfully there are two
02:58 - excellent humble bundles running right
02:59 - now there's one with tons of visuals
03:01 - effects and animations of them in a
03:03 - realistic sound for example this
03:04 - excellent weapon pack there's a bunch of
03:06 - realistic gorgeous explosions if you've
03:08 - got some Villages elves Landscapes a ton
03:11 - of strange creatures some more
03:12 - Landscapes and also packed with a ton of
03:14 - animations over 2300 so this is a huge
03:17 - pack with tons of visuals it's worth
03:19 - 2500 bucks and you can get it for just
03:20 - 30. or if you need some sound effects
03:22 - here's another huge one again this one
03:24 - has over 10 000 sound effects files in
03:26 - over 20 hours of Music everything from
03:28 - some retro ones there's some hot VFX a
03:31 - bunch of voices some medieval some Asian
03:33 - there's lots of music soundscapes and
03:35 - tons of stuff again with a huge discount
03:37 - just 20 bucks go ahead and check out
03:38 - both bundles Link in the description and
03:40 - just one more note UNT actually invited
03:42 - me over to unite which is happening this
03:44 - year in Amsterdam in November this is
03:46 - their conference which is finally coming
03:47 - back in force this year the past few
03:49 - years it was either remote or it was
03:51 - split into tons of tiny conferences this
03:53 - year there's a really big one the
03:55 - tickets are available right now it
03:56 - should be fun so hopefully I'll see a
03:58 - bunch of you there back to the practical
03:59 - plan so step one either take whatever
04:02 - project you're working on right now or
04:03 - come up with a brand new project
04:04 - importantly make sure you pick a very
04:06 - small scope so don't try to make the
04:08 - next GTA or Skyrim pick something you
04:10 - think you can make in about a month and
04:11 - a half as usual people always under my
04:13 - estimate time so if you pick something
04:14 - that takes a month and a half chances
04:16 - are it's going to take you about three
04:17 - months so the goal always pick something
04:19 - that is slightly more complex than
04:20 - something like Flappy Bird but not too
04:22 - complex once you have the core game idea
04:24 - decided then step two is to quickly
04:26 - prepare a steam page and set it as
04:27 - coming soon this step will basically
04:29 - teach you how to get familiar with the
04:31 - steam backend what assets are required
04:33 - in order to make a steam page and how to
04:34 - do it well learning how to make a great
04:36 - scene page with a bunch of gifs and some
04:38 - really nice text and bullet points that
04:39 - is yet another skill and once again
04:41 - another one that you don't gain if you
04:42 - don't take partisan completion related
04:44 - to that is kind of a bonus for this step
04:46 - which is go ahead and start learning
04:47 - about marketing maybe start
04:48 - experimenting with some devlogs or
04:50 - shorts maybe some gifs or Reddit posts
04:52 - start researching about any game
04:54 - marketing and experiment with it to try
04:55 - to gather some wishlists although again
04:57 - at this point they're going with this
04:58 - game is not Financial success it is
05:00 - simply learning so don't worry too much
05:02 - about numbers you just experiment and
05:03 - see what works go ahead and watch my
05:05 - video on marketing and follow the links
05:06 - that I mentioned there for a specific
05:08 - timeline this step should be done
05:09 - roughly within the first month so before
05:11 - the end of August you should have a
05:13 - public coming soon page and start
05:14 - Gathering wishlists then step three is
05:16 - work on the game and get a demo fully
05:18 - playable by October although suddenly
05:20 - actually steam has a really short
05:22 - registration deadline registering for
05:24 - the October Festival they don't really
05:25 - end in mid-july so technically you
05:27 - cannot right now go ahead and register
05:28 - for that next verse but you can
05:30 - definitely publish a demo whenever you
05:31 - want so while you cannot participate in
05:33 - the Fresno official you can definitely
05:35 - make a demo build and publish it at the
05:36 - exact same time again since the going
05:38 - with this plan is to start and complete
05:40 - your first game then this is not a
05:41 - problem you will learn how the team back
05:43 - end Works in order to make a demo which
05:44 - is not what you want absolutely require
05:46 - for more serious projects So the plan
05:48 - for step three is to publish a demo on
05:49 - October 9th this means you have to have
05:51 - your game playable by this point it
05:53 - needs to have beginning it needs to have
05:55 - an end now it doesn't need to be super
05:57 - published or necessarily have all the
05:59 - content but but it does need to be a
06:00 - satisfying if short experience again
06:02 - working on this demo won't give you a
06:04 - taste of what it's like to complete a
06:05 - mini game in order to have a successful
06:07 - demo make sure you watch my video on how
06:08 - to get a wish list and make a good demo
06:10 - for the scene Festival then as the
06:12 - festival rolls around you'll listen to
06:13 - all the feedback from demo and you
06:15 - analyze all the analytics take that and
06:16 - build your game bit by bit until the
06:18 - very end of October by then you should
06:20 - have a near complete game then just
06:22 - spend some time punishing the game
06:23 - publishing everything that you have
06:24 - adding all kinds of tiny animations and
06:26 - effects that make the gameplay feel very
06:28 - satisfying and trying to only step four
06:30 - is either in November or early December
06:32 - you publish your game although keep in
06:34 - mind this step is not just pushing a
06:35 - single button the goal is release the
06:37 - game and then listen to player feedback
06:39 - so read all the reviews read all of the
06:41 - Forum posts if there are playthroughs on
06:43 - YouTube go ahead and watch all of those
06:44 - it's really important to see how people
06:46 - actually play your game rather than just
06:47 - reading text the goal with this step is
06:49 - basically learning how to analyze
06:51 - feedback and figure out what part of
06:52 - that feedback you should take in order
06:54 - to make your next game as best as it can
06:56 - be note how in this entire plan there is
06:58 - absolutely no mention of money or sales
06:59 - success anything at all the going with
07:01 - this plan is simply learning that's it
07:03 - for your first game learning should be
07:04 - your only goal any money that you make
07:06 - is really just a nice bonus once you
07:08 - have gained the knowledge from following
07:09 - this plan then for your second game you
07:11 - can hopefully put everything you learn
07:12 - into action and make a much better game
07:14 - with much better marketing which indeed
07:16 - May yield some Financial results now
07:18 - just one more note for this I should say
07:20 - that this plan is meant for people who
07:22 - are slightly above the complete beginner
07:24 - level if you are a complete absolute
07:26 - beginner if so then instead of starting
07:27 - with this plan I would recommend
07:28 - starting with some something quite a bit
07:30 - more simple for complete beginners first
07:32 - of all I would recommend following my
07:33 - free 10 hour course if you go through
07:35 - the whole thing and you pay attention
07:36 - then by the end you will have gained a
07:38 - ton of knowledge and of course don't
07:39 - assume that you can go through a 10 hour
07:41 - course in just 10 hours the goal is
07:43 - learning it is not just politely
07:44 - watching for me it took me several years
07:46 - to learn all the knowledge contained in
07:47 - this course so if you manage to learn it
07:49 - in about a month or several months that
07:50 - still means you're doing much better
07:52 - than me after that I personally
07:53 - recommend what I covered in my seven
07:54 - steps to become a Game Dev video I
07:56 - recommend making some super simple games
07:58 - things like Flappy Bird or Space
08:00 - Invaders these projects will help you
08:01 - get familiar with the engine then just
08:03 - go ahead and make one or two one month
08:05 - games mini games that take just one
08:07 - month to complete so these should be
08:08 - slightly more complex than things like
08:10 - Flappy Bird but again nothing too
08:11 - complex always keep the scope in check
08:13 - and after you go through those then
08:15 - you're ready to follow the plan in this
08:16 - video and since we're talking about a
08:18 - plan to release Steam games if you found
08:20 - this video useful you can help me by
08:22 - adding my own game thank you Gardens
08:23 - your wishlist also don't forget the 2x
08:25 - on bundles in case you need some assets
08:26 - or sound effects alright hope that's
08:28 - useful check out these videos to learn
08:30 - some more thanks to these awesome
08:32 - patreon supporters for making these
08:34 - videos possible thank you for watching
