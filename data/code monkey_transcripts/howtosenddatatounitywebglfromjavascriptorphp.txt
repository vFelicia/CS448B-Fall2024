00:00 - in this video we're going to see how we
00:02 - can communicate with unity from
00:03 - JavaScript or PHP this allows us to use
00:06 - unity to make really cool-looking
00:08 - complex visuals and work with external
00:10 - data let's begin
00:14 - [Music]
00:18 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:21 - and this channel is all about helping
00:22 - you will learn how to make your own
00:24 - games with in-depth tutorials made by a
00:26 - professional indie game developer so if
00:28 - you find the video helpful consider
00:29 - subscribing okay so this is a bit of a
00:31 - different video from the usual I was
00:33 - researching how to make a nice stats
00:35 - display in unity in order to visualize
00:37 - some data from my website but I couldn't
00:39 - really find much it's actually very
00:41 - simple to do so I'm hoping if someone is
00:43 - looking for a solution to this problem
00:45 - they come across this video we're going
00:47 - to make a simple scene in unity and
00:49 - export to WebGL then we're going to look
00:51 - into the JavaScript code in order to
00:53 - call functions inside of our bill to
00:55 - interact with it and then we're going to
00:57 - use the graph we created in a previous
00:58 - video to make a visual graph that
01:00 - receives data from JavaScript or PHP and
01:02 - displays it in unity so like I said I
01:05 - want to visualize some data from the
01:06 - website I know there are tons of
01:08 - excellent JavaScript charting tools but
01:10 - I'm not very experienced in JavaScript
01:12 - and CSS especially when it comes to
01:14 - making something look good unity is a
01:17 - game engine so it's perfectly set up for
01:19 - making something visual and I'm already
01:21 - very experienced in it there are
01:22 - actually several methods mentioned in
01:24 - the unity manual and I'll link that page
01:26 - in the description here I'll use this
01:29 - simplest way which perfectly solves my
01:30 - problem through JavaScript we can use
01:32 - the function on the Unity WebGL instance
01:35 - called send message which takes an
01:37 - object name than a method name and
01:38 - finally an optional value so let's try
01:41 - that Here I am in my scene so let's make
01:44 - a simple sprites so over here I have a
01:46 - simple circle just drag it and there it
01:48 - is alright so here we have a very basic
01:51 - sprite now we want to interact and
01:53 - change the cone so in order to interact
01:56 - with it as you saw the function requires
01:58 - an object name and a method name so in
02:01 - here and let's make a new object let's
02:03 - call this our javascript hook and let's
02:06 - make it script so you need C sharp
02:09 - script our JavaScript hook and let's
02:12 - attach it on to the object now in here
02:14 - the script does not necessarily have to
02:16 - have the same name as the object but
02:18 - this helps keep our scene nice and
02:19 - organized okay now in this script let's
02:22 - make some methods to simply change the
02:24 - color of our sprites
02:30 - all right so here we have a reference to
02:33 - our circle sprite renderer and then a
02:35 - function to tint red which simply sets
02:36 - color and went to tint in green okay now
02:39 - just for testing let's call these
02:40 - functions from key press all right so we
02:48 - can test by pressing these two keys
02:50 - let's see ok here we are with default
02:52 - sprite now press T there you go now it's
02:54 - red press Y and there you go now it's
02:56 - green right awesome
02:57 - so our very basic logic is working
02:59 - correctly great now let's make this into
03:01 - a WebGL built so we just need to go into
03:03 - file don't settings never here we have
03:06 - the WebGL and we simply built okay it's
03:09 - done and here we have our bill running
03:10 - on a browser and if we press our keys
03:12 - yup we can still take the color okay so
03:15 - far so good now we don't want to tint it
03:18 - based on key presses browser based on
03:19 - JavaScript buttons so here is the HTML
03:22 - file as it comes from the build and now
03:24 - we're in here and let's just make some
03:25 - very basic buttons all right so here we
03:40 - have two very basic buttons so
03:42 - essentially just a div that we can click
03:44 - so in order to click we use the on click
03:47 - parameter so here we can put some
03:49 - JavaScript code and CIN here that we go
03:51 - into the unity instance so this is the
03:53 - object that is created all the way up
03:55 - here so use that then we call send
03:57 - message and now first we pass in the
04:01 - object name so again back in the editor
04:03 - our object name is over here the
04:05 - JavaScript hook so you pass in the
04:07 - object name and then we pass in the
04:09 - method name so in this case it's 10th
04:11 - red all right so we have our two
04:16 - functions when we click we're going to
04:17 - execute this JavaScript code let's see
04:19 - okay here we are and there's our two
04:21 - buttons now as I press on this one and
04:23 - there we go these brighter in red
04:25 - precision and it turns green all right
04:27 - so just like this we can interact with
04:30 - our unity instance from some JavaScript
04:32 - code awesome
04:33 - now in this send message function we're
04:35 - calling with the object name the
04:37 - function name and then we can also pass
04:39 - in a optional parameter so right now
04:41 - it's
04:41 - empty we can pass in either a number or
04:44 - a string so let's test that back in our
04:47 - unity editor let's make two text fields
05:08 - all right so I've added two different
05:11 - text fields now let's handle them in our
05:13 - script alright so there it is just like
05:33 - that we have our references for our text
05:35 - objects and then we simply have a set
05:36 - number and set string okay now let's
05:38 - make our WebGL build okay here we have
05:41 - our new WebGL build with our two text
05:43 - fields and again the color still works
05:45 - okay now let's do the JavaScript to
05:47 - interact with these so here we are on
05:49 - the index.html and just copy these so
05:55 - for the number here is the function name
05:57 - set number so you pass in set number and
06:00 - then let's say a number then we have set
06:02 - string then we can pass in a string
06:06 - alright let's test okay here we have our
06:09 - two buttons so I can change the color
06:12 - okay that works now change the number
06:13 - and there we go he received a number
06:15 - change the string and there you go he
06:16 - received a string so just like this we
06:19 - are calling you a whole bunch of
06:20 - functions passing in a whole bunch of
06:22 - different parameters right awesome now
06:25 - you might have already guessed how we
06:26 - can expand upon this to pass in pretty
06:28 - much anything we want if we can pass in
06:30 - a string then that means we can take
06:32 - whatever that we have encoded into JSON
06:35 - and easily send it into unity if you're
06:37 - not familiar with Jason check out the
06:39 - video on linked in the description where
06:40 - I cover how it is and how its formatted
06:42 - I've also covered using jason to make a
06:44 - safe system so check that out to see how
06:47 - you can use jason to encode safe data
06:49 - which is similar to what we're going to
06:50 - do in here so let's try to send some
06:52 - JSON back in our unity script let's make
06:55 - a simple object to test our JSON parsing
07:01 - alright here we have a simple object
07:03 - with two fields a string for name and
07:05 - and for the H now a function to receive
07:08 - it so we have a function with the
07:12 - parameter type string so we're going to
07:14 - receive our JSON and then we use the
07:16 - JSON utility we do from jason convert
07:21 - that jason into our JSON object so here
07:26 - we have our JSON object alright and then
07:33 - we simply update our string okay that's
07:35 - it very simple let's test okay now in
07:39 - our HTML code and let's make an object
07:41 - and pass it into our unity instance so
07:43 - we're here in our JavaScript let's make
07:45 - a javascript object okay here we have a
07:51 - Chava script object now we convert it
07:54 - into jason so we use jason dot stringify
07:59 - so here we have our JSON string and now
08:02 - let's make the button to send it into
08:04 - our game so again the function name is
08:15 - called test Jason so that's the function
08:17 - name and then in here we pass in the
08:20 - object that we created in here so a JSON
08:22 - string all right let's see okay here we
08:25 - are and we can still change colors we
08:26 - can still send the numbers and string
08:28 - and now a JSON object and there you go
08:30 - here we have our object it correctly
08:32 - parse the name as John HS 34 so our
08:36 - unity WebGL bill correctly received a
08:38 - JSON string and parsed it to get the
08:40 - name and H awesome alright so here we
08:43 - have our functioning valent receiving
08:45 - any data we want from JavaScript we can
08:47 - take it one step further and get some
08:49 - data with PHP and use it in our
08:51 - JavaScript code all right so here we
08:53 - have some simple PHP code so we have our
08:56 - JSON string then we go into our PHP we
08:59 - create a new object we call JSON encode
09:02 - and then we simply echo the JSON
09:04 - representation so if we go back into our
09:06 - build and we call this function and
09:08 - there yo now it received a me with age
09:10 - of 29 so just like this we are
09:12 - essentially communicating with unity
09:14 - PHP so these are the basics and now you
09:16 - can easily expand upon it for example
09:19 - here I have this scene which has the
09:21 - graph that was made from scratch in a
09:22 - previous video so here is the graph
09:24 - running inside of unity and if here we
09:27 - are on the WebGL build and now with this
09:29 - button we can pass in different values
09:31 - to unity and I click and there you go
09:33 - now the graph received a bunch of
09:35 - different values so click on them and
09:37 - there you go so here we have some data
09:39 - being displayed and of the data is
09:41 - external and not hard-coded inside of
09:43 - the unity WebGL build at all so now you
09:45 - know how to interact with a WebGL build
09:47 - from JavaScript or PHP or anywhere else
09:50 - as always you can download the project
09:52 - files in utilities from in tucumán keep
09:54 - calm
