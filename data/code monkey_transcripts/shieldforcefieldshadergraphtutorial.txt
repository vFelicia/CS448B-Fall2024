00:00 - in this video we're going to make a nice
00:01 - shield force field effect using share
00:03 - graph this is a great effect to indicate
00:05 - that a certain area is protected to
00:07 - either bought the player or bought
00:08 - projectiles you can see it uses an
00:10 - action in the FPS game I made recently
00:12 - let's begin
00:16 - [Music]
00:20 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:23 - and this channel is all about helping
00:24 - you learn how to make your own games
00:26 - with NF tutorials made by a professional
00:28 - indie game developer so if you find the
00:29 - video helpful consider subscribing ok so
00:32 - the effect we're trying to make here is
00:34 - the one in the FPS game I made in just 5
00:36 - days if you haven't seen it yet then go
00:38 - check out that video and play the game
00:40 - it's very quick and playable fully in
00:42 - your browser so here I wanted to make
00:44 - something that looked like a shield
00:45 - force field effect that the enemies
00:47 - could shoot through but not a player so
00:49 - this is the effect that I came up with
00:51 - we have a sphere mesh with a material
00:53 - applied the texture is showing some
00:55 - hexagons animated moving upwards the
00:57 - effect has some nice HDR colors with a
00:59 - nice bloom effect and you can see I'm
01:01 - lined with extra bloom constantly
01:03 - scanning over our shield so we can all
01:05 - walk around the shield and even go
01:07 - inside it and the whole thing works
01:08 - great again go play that micro game to
01:11 - see the effect in action so first we're
01:13 - going to make the shader work with a 3d
01:15 - mesh and then we're also going to apply
01:17 - it to a 2d sprite that way we can use it
01:19 - on either 2d or 3d games alright so this
01:22 - is our goal let's get to it so here we
01:25 - are in a basic scene I just have a for
01:28 - any simple character control everything
01:30 - is set for 3d since we're going to start
01:32 - off with a 3d shader now over here in
01:34 - the project files I have the various
01:36 - textures we're going to need there's the
01:38 - base hexagon texture then we have a
01:41 - emission texture to make sure our
01:42 - hexagons glow and finally have a simple
01:45 - gradient texture that we're going to
01:47 - animate so let's start off by creating a
01:49 - new shader make it a PBR graph call this
01:53 - our shield
01:54 - PBR ok here we are in our shooter graph
01:57 - and here we have our PBR masternode now
02:00 - the first thing we need is obviously our
02:02 - texture so we make a new property of
02:04 - texture 2d call it our main text and set
02:07 - the reference to underscore main text
02:09 - this has to be this exact name for the
02:12 - primary texture now let's select default
02:14 - so we have our hexagons as our default
02:17 - now let's drag the texture onto our
02:20 - board and now we need to assemble it so
02:21 - create a new simple texture node drag
02:24 - the texture on there and the output into
02:27 - our albedo and just like that you can
02:29 - see it apply into our sphere preview ok
02:31 - so far so good
02:33 - let's test this out so back in the
02:35 - editor let's make a new sphere so a 3d
02:38 - object just a sphere right there it is
02:46 - we have our nice fear now let's create a
02:48 - brand new material
02:50 - I want our shield and let's set our
02:53 - shooter inside the shade where I've
02:54 - shown PBR and just like that it already
02:56 - has the main texture default texture so
02:59 - now we just apply it into our sphere
03:00 - just like that and just like that we
03:03 - have our sphere with our basic texture
03:04 - added into our world all right now one
03:07 - of the issues that you can already see
03:09 - is we didn't lack of transparency so
03:10 - let's solve that so that's very simple
03:12 - all we need to do is go into the PVR
03:14 - master node click on the gear icon in
03:16 - there and then here we have our surface
03:18 - and switch from opaque into transparent
03:20 - and in our case for the shield we also
03:23 - want it to be to silent so click that
03:25 - one as well all right that you do it
03:27 - let's test can if there is there's the
03:29 - texture applied and now we can go inside
03:31 - and there you go we can view it from the
03:32 - inside
03:33 - so our texture correctly has two sides
03:36 - and it's also transparent you can see it
03:39 - in the hole there
03:39 - alright so far so good now obviously
03:41 - another huge issue is the size of the
03:43 - texture so back in the shooter graph
03:46 - let's resize our texture by going in
03:49 - here and we add a tunneling an offset
03:51 - note we pass this into the UV input and
03:55 - now in here we can modify the tongue so
03:57 - for example let's put it 10/10 and this
04:00 - should make the texture repeat itself
04:01 - but as you can see it's not doing that
04:03 - the reason is on the texture import
04:05 - option so let's go there here on the
04:07 - texture import options we have our
04:08 - texture and we need to go into rap mode
04:10 - and switch it from clamp into repeat as
04:12 - soon as we hit a point there you go
04:14 - there's our texture now repeating itself
04:16 - so let's make sure we apply this to all
04:18 - of our textures so all these two also
04:20 - make them repeat ok now back in the
04:22 - shader graph you can already see our
04:23 - effect correctly working so instead of
04:25 - 10 let's put it 5 5 and we can play
04:27 - around with these values now in order to
04:29 - not have these values hard-code the
04:30 - initiator itself let's make a nice
04:32 - property so we create a new vector to
04:35 - call this the main text styling here
04:39 - lets default it to 5/5 and we can simply
04:42 - drag it into our scene and the
04:44 - put for our telling ok so just like that
04:48 - now let's look at it in game here's the
04:51 - texture and as you can see it is now
04:52 - much smaller and we can some point
04:54 - around in the values over here in the
04:56 - inspector we can similarly modify the
04:57 - main text sound let's put it at 10:10
04:59 - and just like this it starts to look
05:02 - more like a shield
05:03 - okay so far so good now back in the
05:06 - shadow graph let's just apply our alpha
05:08 - channel so we just connect the alpha
05:10 - directly in there let's see
05:12 - and yep there's our shield now looking
05:14 - more and more like a shield ok so far so
05:16 - good now let's deal with our emission so
05:18 - for that let's add our texture so we
05:20 - create a new texture TD call this our
05:23 - mission text okay there's the emission
05:30 - just regular in there and simple it like
05:32 - we did with the other one then let's
05:37 - apply the exact same telling so use down
05:39 - and yep just like that and now we take
05:41 - this and drag it straight on to the
05:43 - emission field okay so just like this
05:45 - let's test I just like that we have our
05:47 - shield with a nice emission texture
05:49 - applied onto it right so far so good now
05:52 - let's see how we can animate our shield
05:54 - so the way we're going to do it is by
05:56 - using this same telling an offset node
05:58 - we're essentially going to increase the
06:00 - offset over time and that's how we move
06:02 - our texture we want to increase it over
06:04 - time so for that we create a time node
06:07 - and we want to use this time value in
06:10 - here however this is a fault whereas
06:12 - this requires a vector too so we need to
06:15 - make a combined node and now here it's a
06:21 - bit confusing since the combine now
06:23 - chose labels for colors but it works the
06:24 - same for vectors so here the R equals
06:27 - the X and the G equals the Y so we pass
06:30 - in the time onto the gene saints who
06:32 - want to move it on the Y and we pass in
06:34 - the ERG which is the XY and put it on
06:36 - the offset and there you go just like
06:38 - that d texture is already nicely
06:40 - animated however we have two issues
06:42 - first of all it's moving too fast and
06:44 - secondly it's going down instead of up
06:46 - so let's on the direction which is very
06:48 - simple in here before we create our
06:51 - vector we just had a negate node and we
06:54 - negate our time value and pass
06:56 - there and there you go now the texture
06:58 - is moving up okay
06:59 - and now for the spin let's go up here to
07:02 - make a new vector one come with our
07:04 - shield spin and let's default it to
07:09 - point five now we can drag it onto our
07:11 - board and all we really need is to have
07:13 - a multiply node where we multiply the
07:15 - speed by the time before negating and
07:18 - going forward all right so let's just
07:20 - drag this and put it like that just like
07:23 - that okay great so just like that our
07:25 - speed knob looks better by being a bit
07:27 - slower and now we can also switch this
07:29 - from mode put it on a slider and drag it
07:32 - from zero to two this way we can easily
07:34 - modify this filner to make our shield
07:36 - faster or slower so let's test this out
07:39 - and here we are and yep there you go our
07:41 - shield is now nicely animated going up
07:43 - and here on the inspector we can see our
07:45 - shield speed and we can simply drag it
07:47 - to make it go much slower there you go
07:49 - very slow or very fast so there you go
07:52 - our effect is nicely customisable so we
07:55 - have successfully animated our shield
07:56 - awesome now here we have some basic
07:59 - emission we want to be able to tint it
08:01 - in different colors and play around with
08:03 - the intensity so back in our shadow
08:04 - graph let's make a new property of type
08:07 - color and let's call this the emission
08:10 - color let's switch the modes from
08:16 - default into HDR and here let's pick a
08:19 - nice blue okay so all we need is to take
08:25 - our color in here and then we make a
08:27 - multiply node and we multiply this color
08:30 - by our emission texture and we pass the
08:33 - output onto the emission on the master
08:35 - so just like that alright let's see it
08:37 - in game and yep there it is in game our
08:40 - shield with a very nice intense glow
08:42 - effect and here in the inspector we can
08:44 - play around with color so for example
08:45 - now we have a blue now make it a darker
08:47 - blue make it lighter make it a lot more
08:50 - intense way too intense and we can
08:52 - switch it to commerce and let's make it
08:54 - a more red more green and so on and so
08:56 - forth so there you go
08:57 - another nice customization option okay
09:00 - so our effect is coming along great we
09:01 - already have our shield working very
09:03 - nice now let's use the gradient texture
09:06 - to add an extra effect on top so back in
09:09 - our shield we're
09:09 - first we need the texture so we create a
09:11 - new texture 2d for our gradient
09:14 - okay so let's drag the texture in here
09:17 - and as always we first sample it so
09:20 - sample this texture yep there's our
09:22 - gradient and now we're going to take
09:24 - this color and add a multiply node and
09:29 - we're going to multiply our gradient by
09:31 - the output of our emission so there it
09:34 - is you can see the effect and now we can
09:36 - add this one on top of our emission in
09:37 - order to get a bit extra so here with a
09:43 - add node you can already see the effect
09:45 - and then we pass all this into the
09:47 - emission on the Ambassador and okay
09:48 - there it is now here we can add a color
09:51 - on top of our gradient like we did for
09:52 - the emission so let's make a new color
09:56 - here and let's put it at almost white
10:06 - and drag it in there okay and all we do
10:10 - is add a multiply node so multiply our
10:12 - extra color by that one and then we pass
10:14 - that one in there and there you go now
10:16 - we have a more intense effect okay so
10:19 - let's see this in game and if there is
10:22 - there is a shield with the gradient
10:23 - effects on top now it's currently being
10:25 - applied to the entire texture so it's a
10:27 - bit hard to see so let's deal with the
10:29 - tiling as well as animated now in order
10:31 - to do that we're going to do pretty much
10:33 - the same thing that we did in here so we
10:35 - need a tunneling and offset node and
10:41 - first to animate it we pass in the same
10:44 - vector that we used in there so we pass
10:46 - it on the offset and there you go you
10:48 - can already see the gradient constantly
10:49 - going up now like this gradient is going
10:52 - at the exact same speed as our main
10:53 - texture we want to make it a bit faster
10:55 - so we can simply make a vector one and
10:59 - first we multiply these and like this we
11:09 - have it going a bit faster so that's
11:11 - good now we also want to tell it more
11:13 - than just once so for that let's make it
11:15 - properly after I vector one call it the
11:18 - gradient child why
11:27 - let's see from two to four and now we
11:29 - just have to point into our telling so
11:31 - we drag it in here we'll create a new
11:33 - combine node and we want to tell it on
11:35 - the Y so we pass in the g and passing
11:37 - the RG in there and just like that yep
11:40 - you can see our nice gradient being
11:41 - tiled several times on the Y alright so
11:44 - let's see how our effect isn't looking
11:45 - right now and you here we are with our
11:47 - nice field effect as you can see we have
11:50 - the nice gradient going a bit faster
11:52 - than the actual shield
11:53 - hexagon and in-home effect looks pretty
11:56 - great here in the inspector we have all
11:58 - the families that we can play around
11:59 - with so we can make it move faster or
12:01 - slower and we can make the gradient tile
12:03 - more or less so just like that we get a
12:06 - bunch more rings on our gradient and we
12:09 - also can play around with colors so for
12:11 - the x-ray emission for example let's try
12:12 - putting it more of a green more of a red
12:15 - yellow and so on
12:16 - alright so here we have a great force
12:18 - field shield effect and we can also go
12:20 - inside and yep everything looks pretty
12:22 - nice alright now let's finally take this
12:24 - and make it into a spray chater
12:26 - ok so making this sprite is very simple
12:29 - let's simply duplicate our graph come
12:32 - with our shield sprite you know here is
12:35 - our complete nice shadow graph and all
12:37 - we need to do is modify our mess or node
12:39 - so we can go into master and in sets
12:42 - select the sprite lid so here are both
12:46 - of our master notes now we right-click
12:48 - on this one called set active and now we
12:51 - can get rid of the master node now here
12:53 - one of the main differences is that the
12:55 - sprite master does not have an emission
12:57 - but rather the emission is baked into
12:59 - the color so we just had a multiply node
13:02 - in order to multiply our emission by our
13:05 - base color and we pass that into the
13:07 - cone and let's right-click and make this
13:09 - into a quad so here on the quad you can
13:13 - already see the exact same effect
13:14 - however when working with sprites it
13:16 - makes more sense to have a spray
13:18 - cheap rather than a machine so let's go
13:21 - into our min tax which is our hexagon
13:23 - texture and we're going to rename this
13:25 - from min tax into shield text and now
13:28 - that we have renamed that now we can add
13:30 - a new texture and this one we're going
13:32 - to call the main text and a 4d foam
13:35 - let's select a circle okay so now we
13:37 - drag our texture in here we sample it
13:42 - and now we just need to multiply this by
13:44 - our output from there so we multiply our
13:47 - circle by our output in the colors in
13:50 - here and we drag them out into the color
13:55 - and there you go now we have our nice
13:57 - spreadsheet now one more thing we can do
13:59 - which is nice is applying a nice alpha
14:01 - so just add a new vector one comma T
14:04 - alpha we just multiply the Alpha by our
14:16 - texture and then we apply it in there
14:18 - and everything is the same all right so
14:20 - that's it let's test okay so here we are
14:22 - in a 2d scene now we simply create a new
14:24 - sprite render and now we need a material
14:26 - to a point to it so we create our
14:28 - material and we select our graphs
14:33 - and our shield sprite and there it is
14:35 - our inspector properly so now we just
14:37 - drag it into our sprite and there it is
14:42 - there's our sprite nicely applicator so
14:44 - here the shield effect essentially works
14:46 - on top of this sprite so we can change
14:48 - the sprite for example let's use this
14:49 - one and there you go there's our nice
14:51 - shield effect so you can play it in game
14:53 - any of here we are in game with our
14:55 - working shield effect working as a
14:56 - sprite so you're in the inspector I can
14:58 - change the sprite and if there it is now
15:01 - I can change the alpha so make it more
15:02 - transparent more visible that's really
15:04 - visible and again we can simply around
15:07 - down to colors like the emission and
15:09 - play around all this and it's a great
15:11 - looking effect so point to different
15:17 - textures and there you go it looks great
15:28 - so just like this we built our great
15:30 - effect we made it work both in 2d and 3d
15:32 - you can see this effect in action in the
15:35 - FPS game I made using unities micro game
15:38 - as a base go check out that video and
15:40 - play the game for yourself it's very
15:41 - quick and fully playable in the browser
15:43 - in there you don't see the shield effect
15:45 - being used on with a nice shield system
15:47 - as always you can download the project
15:49 - found any tony's from unity code monkey
15:51 - comm subscribe to the channel for more
15:53 - unity tutorials post any questions you
