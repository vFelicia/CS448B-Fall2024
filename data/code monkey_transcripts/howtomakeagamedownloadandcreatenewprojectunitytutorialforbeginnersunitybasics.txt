00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - here's a super quick video for complete
00:04 - beginners let's see how to download
00:06 - Unity how to create a new project and
00:08 - set it up so you can get started
00:09 - building games also in the end I will
00:11 - show some links and video references
00:13 - where you can continue your Learning
00:14 - Journey there's timestamps in the video
00:16 - if you want to skip ahead so let's get
00:18 - started right away from the beginning
00:19 - first up you need to download Unity so
00:22 - for that just go into unity.com
00:24 - then over here click on the top right on
00:26 - the big get start button and when you do
00:29 - takes it to this page where you can see
00:30 - all the plans and pricing chances are
00:32 - the one that you want is over here on
00:34 - the individual tab so if you click on it
00:36 - over here you see the personal which is
00:37 - commonly free also just one quick note
00:39 - so you don't get confused with all the
00:41 - plans basically don't worry about the
00:43 - fact there are multiple all of them the
00:45 - engine is exactly the same there's no
00:46 - limitations on the free version compared
00:48 - to the paid version nothing like that
00:49 - the engine is the same on all of them
00:52 - the only difference is over here the
00:53 - eligibility you can only use the free
00:55 - personal version if you have revenue or
00:57 - funding of less than 100K in the last 12
00:59 - months now if you're watching this
01:01 - complete beginner video then chances are
01:03 - you're just getting started so the free
01:04 - version is more than perfect so go ahead
01:06 - click on get started then you download
01:09 - you can download for Windows or Mac or
01:11 - Linux personally I'm on windows so I'm
01:13 - going to click on the big button this
01:15 - downloads the unity Hub Unity Hub is the
01:18 - program to manage all of the various
01:19 - into versions and all of your varies in
01:21 - the projects so just go ahead and
01:23 - install it and open okay so here we have
01:25 - the unity Hub and right away it asks you
01:27 - to sign in or create an account if you
01:30 - already have an account go ahead and
01:31 - sign in if not click on create you just
01:34 - fill in your data and create then back
01:36 - into UNT Hub now you can sign in
01:40 - next up it asks you about a int version
01:42 - and by default at the time of recording
01:44 - it selects version 2021.3 on TS now if
01:47 - you want to learn more about Unity
01:48 - versions and I made a quick video
01:50 - explainer in there I explain what is LTS
01:52 - what is tag preview and what all the
01:54 - numbers mean
01:56 - so go watch that video if you want to
01:57 - learn some more but over here Unity Hub
01:59 - already selects the best version you
02:01 - should be using which in this case
02:03 - version 21.3 which is the latest LTS
02:06 - version so just go ahead choose that one
02:07 - choose a folder and install then ask you
02:10 - to select a license like I said the
02:12 - personal license is exactly the one you
02:13 - want the only limitation is having
02:15 - Revenue under 100K per year but again if
02:17 - you're watching this beginner video I'm
02:19 - guessing this is perfect for you so go
02:20 - ahead and select it it will
02:22 - automatically begin downloading the
02:23 - entire editor
02:26 - okay so when it's done you can close the
02:28 - downloads window then over here we can
02:30 - see the phone ENT Hub on the side view
02:32 - we can see the various tabs you have the
02:34 - unlearn tab this has a bunch of official
02:37 - Indian links where you can learn how to
02:38 - do all kinds of things with unity then
02:40 - you also have the community tab a bunch
02:42 - of links for the forums documentation
02:44 - and so on
02:45 - then the installs tab is where you can
02:47 - download other ENT versions and for what
02:50 - we want right now let's go into the
02:51 - projects tab then click on the create
02:53 - new project button now in this window up
02:56 - top we can see the version selector if
02:58 - you have multiple versions installed
02:59 - then you can choose which one you want
03:01 - to use for this new project in our case
03:03 - we just have one version so let's keep
03:05 - using that one next up we need to select
03:07 - the template there's a whole bunch of
03:09 - them depending on what kind of game you
03:10 - want to make you can see the categories
03:13 - over here on the side by default it
03:15 - starts by showing you the unity micro
03:16 - games these are small complete games on
03:19 - various genres they are complete
03:21 - projects so these can be great for
03:23 - learning as a beginner so maybe you can
03:24 - look into these ones later but in this
03:26 - video we want to create a brand new
03:28 - empty project so let's keep looking then
03:30 - you have the simple scenes these are
03:32 - pre-configured to work with a certain
03:34 - Runner Pipeline and they have a really
03:36 - nice demo scene set up speaking of
03:38 - render pipeline CNT has three of them
03:40 - there's the Legacy built-in render
03:41 - pipeline the universal render pipeline
03:43 - or urp and the high def definition
03:45 - regular pipeline or hdrp now if you're a
03:48 - beginner you don't need to worry about
03:50 - that at all just choose the universal
03:51 - another pipeline or urp and you're good
03:54 - to go it's what I always use it's
03:56 - perfect for 99 of use cases you can make
03:58 - games that run on mobile desktop console
04:01 - or anything so it runs on everything and
04:03 - it also looks great so here we see the
04:05 - various samples there's one for herp one
04:07 - for urp and a cinematic sample but again
04:10 - let's keep searching then we have the
04:12 - core templates you have a 2d and a 3D
04:14 - template these two are for the unlikely
04:16 - render pipeline so don't use these then
04:19 - you have the same two for urp and the
04:21 - final ones for hdrp down here you also
04:24 - have the official ENT Stern assets we're
04:26 - actually going to be using this in a bit
04:28 - but like I said right now we want to
04:29 - create a little new empty project in
04:32 - most cases you want to be using urp so
04:34 - you should choose one of these two if
04:36 - you want to make a 2d game choose 2D if
04:38 - not choose 3D by the way also just
04:40 - another quick note here choosing a
04:42 - template doesn't really block you from
04:44 - anything meaning you can choose to start
04:46 - with the 3D template and then make a 2d
04:48 - game or you can pick the 2D template and
04:51 - then make a 3D game basically what these
04:52 - templates do is they just install a
04:54 - bunch of relevant packages so the 2D
04:57 - template when you create it it already
04:58 - has lots of 2D packages added so you can
05:01 - make Sprite style maps and so on and the
05:03 - 3D template already comes with 3D
05:05 - packages but again after creating the
05:07 - project you can install any more
05:08 - packages you want so like I said don't
05:10 - worry too much about choosing the quote
05:12 - unquote wrong template whatever reason
05:13 - light you can then later on do anything
05:15 - in any Dimension so over here I'm going
05:17 - to choose the 3D urp template then go
05:20 - ahead and download it now just give it a
05:23 - project name name it whatever you want
05:24 - you select the folder where you want the
05:26 - project to be created and finally when
05:29 - everything is set up just go ahead click
05:30 - on create
05:31 - okay so with that the project is being
05:33 - created now let's just wait a bit and
05:35 - yep over here is the main ENT window by
05:38 - default you can see it already comes
05:39 - with a bunch of packages print sound and
05:42 - over here on the assets you can see a
05:43 - nice readme file if you want to learn
05:45 - more about the Universe on Reddit
05:46 - pipeline over here you've got some
05:48 - documentation forms and so on or if you
05:50 - want you can also clean it up so click
05:52 - on the button to remove the readme
05:53 - assets and there you go it cleans it up
05:54 - alright so now let's just quickly get
05:56 - something playable like I mentioned
05:58 - Unity has some excellent free start
06:00 - assets that are really awesome they are
06:02 - really great starting points so over
06:04 - here on the NT accessor let's find the
06:06 - ntsar acids you can use the search bar
06:08 - or just go over here under the
06:10 - essentials tab let's go to the ones by
06:12 - unity now here we see all of unity's
06:14 - assets and over here we've got these two
06:16 - the star assets the third person
06:17 - controller and the first person
06:19 - controller these are really excellent
06:21 - turning points so just go ahead and pick
06:22 - which one you want for me I'm going to
06:24 - choose the third person sorry controller
06:26 - so just go here and click on the button
06:28 - to add to your assets then click on
06:30 - button to open it in unity with this it
06:33 - opens up the package manager and
06:34 - automatically Scrolls down into the star
06:36 - assets just in case this doesn't happen
06:38 - automatically you can only suggest going
06:39 - to window open up the package manager
06:41 - then on the packs you manager on the top
06:43 - left corner click on this drop down menu
06:45 - and select my assets then on the search
06:47 - bar here you can search for SAR assets
06:49 - and up here we see both of them so just
06:52 - go ahead and click on the button to
06:53 - download in my case I just need to
06:55 - update then click on import here's the
06:58 - import window let's make sure all of
06:59 - them are selected so click on all and
07:01 - let's import
07:03 - okay after a while everything is
07:04 - important now for this specific asset
07:06 - let's use the new input system again as
07:08 - a beginner don't worry too much but when
07:10 - working with this asset let's go ahead
07:12 - click on yes to make sure we switch the
07:13 - new input system okay so it restarted
07:16 - the editor also just in case you click
07:18 - on no in that one you can also go into
07:19 - edit then go into the project settings
07:21 - then here scroll down and find the
07:23 - player tab then scroll down and under
07:25 - other settings down here we can find the
07:28 - input system so here it is the active
07:30 - input handling
07:31 - and basically click on yes simply
07:33 - swapped it from the input manager into
07:34 - new input system so just in case you
07:36 - click on no you can go up here and
07:38 - manually swap into this one or you can
07:40 - select both of them okay so with that
07:42 - now we see all of our star assets so
07:43 - let's go inside let's go inside the
07:45 - third person controller inside the
07:47 - scenes folder and over here we've got
07:49 - the playground scene let's open this and
07:51 - by default we see this in pink now if
07:53 - you don't know pink usually means a
07:54 - Shader error so what we have here is
07:57 - because by default these assets are
07:58 - imported using the Lacy render pipeline
08:00 - but again if you remember we select the
08:02 - universal render pipeline again this is
08:04 - not a problem it's super easy to convert
08:05 - so for that let's go up here into window
08:07 - then go into rendering and let's find
08:10 - the render pipeline converter and on
08:12 - this one on the drop down menu let's
08:14 - select upgrade from built-in to urp then
08:17 - just go ahead and talk on this checkbox
08:18 - next to material upgrade this will
08:20 - automatically upgrade all the materials
08:22 - so let's click to initialize the
08:23 - converter now it finds all the materials
08:25 - that need importing just click on
08:27 - convert assets and it does automatically
08:29 - and we can see the background already
08:30 - updates so we can just go ahead exit
08:33 - this now hit on the play button and you
08:35 - here it is here we have our project
08:37 - created and we have a character we can
08:39 - walk around we can jump we can do
08:40 - anything we want all right awesome
08:43 - so this is a great starting point to
08:45 - build upon now one thing you should
08:47 - probably do is move around these windows
08:48 - to organize your own layout to something
08:50 - that feels comfortable to you all of
08:52 - these windows all these tabs like for
08:53 - example the game window you can swap it
08:55 - out drag it over here create a new one
08:56 - and so on so all of these can be placed
08:59 - exactly where you want it you can Define
09:01 - the kind of layout that you like and
09:02 - then when you have that you can go up
09:04 - here to the top right corner click on
09:05 - the layout button and then you can click
09:07 - on the button to save your layout or if
09:10 - you already have a layout just like I
09:12 - have my layout you can just go ahead
09:14 - click to select it and automatically
09:15 - load the previous layout so for me after
09:18 - using Unity for over 10 years this
09:19 - layout that I like so I like to have the
09:21 - inspector on the side down here the
09:23 - hierarchy next to it the project over
09:25 - here with nice compact list then next
09:27 - with the console Tab and in the main big
09:29 - window I've got the game and next week
09:31 - the scene View so again this is the
09:33 - layout that I personally like but you
09:34 - can go ahead and select anything and
09:36 - with this here it is here we have our
09:38 - fully working style project so now that
09:40 - you know how to create the brand new ENT
09:42 - project if you want to get a super quick
09:44 - overview of the NT Basics then check out
09:46 - this other video explaining tons of
09:47 - empty things in just 17 minutes there's
09:50 - links in the description and then the
09:52 - UNT programming language is c-sharp if
09:54 - you want to learn Basics I also have
09:55 - another video on it and after that after
09:57 - learning the absolute Basics you can
09:59 - certainly look for more complex things
10:01 - you can use the various search buttons
10:03 - on my website to find video tutorials on
10:05 - all kinds of topics maybe you can learn
10:07 - some more about c-sharp maybe learn
10:09 - about events delegates or more advanced
10:11 - things or you can get started making a
10:13 - really versatile grid system which
10:15 - allows you to make a city Builder
10:17 - Factory game Tetris inventory system and
10:19 - much more you can learn how to make
10:21 - Unity low how to use send machine to
10:23 - control your cameras how to do character
10:25 - customization or just swap out your
10:27 - character
10:28 - learn where you can get free characters
10:30 - and animations how to make a 2d

10:38 - videos for over four years now I've got
10:40 - tons of tutorials on lots of topics over
10:42 - 500 videos so if you browse around
10:44 - you'll find something for whatever you
10:45 - want to learn or if you prefer a more
10:47 - guide path then check out my complete
10:49 - step-by-step courses I have a course on
10:51 - making a builder Defender game using C
10:53 - sharp just like I can make my own Steam
10:55 - games or if you prefer visual scripting
10:57 - then I made a complete course on that it
10:59 - involves making three unique games all
11:01 - internally with visual scripting there
11:03 - isn't a single line of code in any of
11:04 - these games or if you want to learn
11:06 - about all of the tools the engine has
11:08 - and check out what they do you can go
11:10 - watch My ultimate TNT overview course
11:11 - each lecture is on explaining a
11:13 - different two or more feature of the
11:15 - engine
11:15 - and then once you know the basics and
11:17 - you feel really confident that you're
11:19 - ready to make the jump from beginner to
11:20 - Advanced at that point you can get my
11:22 - turn-based strategy course I designed it
11:24 - specifically to help guide you and take
11:26 - you from beginner to Advanced so in that
11:28 - course I assume you know the Epsilon
11:30 - Basics and then help you take the leap
11:31 - to the next level by making a more
11:33 - complex game using things like c-sharp
11:35 - generics delegates using cinemachine Ai
11:38 - and all of it while focusing on writing
11:39 - good clean code again this one is a more
11:42 - advanced course if you're a beginner
11:43 - make sure you learn the basics first
11:45 - alright so that's my super quick getting
11:47 - started guide for creating a new ENT
11:49 - project the engine is capable of
11:51 - anything so the only limit is really
11:52 - just your own skills and your
11:53 - imagination now go ahead and start
11:55 - learning and building your dream games
