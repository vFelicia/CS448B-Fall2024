00:00 - in this video we're going to check out a
00:01 - nice RPG I made in two weeks for a game
00:04 - jam it features an over map with enemies
00:06 - and NPCs a turn-based battle system and
00:09 - a nice small story with dialogue and
00:11 - cutscenes let's begin
00:15 - [Music]
00:19 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:22 - and this channel is all about helping
00:23 - you will learn how to make your own
00:25 - games with in-depth tutorials made by a
00:27 - professional indie game developer so if
00:28 - you find the video helpful consider
00:30 - subscribing so first of all this game is
00:32 - an entry to the easy allies Glenys
00:34 - countering game jam you can play the
00:36 - game on itch and like every other video
00:38 - on the channel you can download the
00:39 - project files from the website I've been
00:42 - a big fan of easy allies since they were
00:43 - game trailers and I've been meaning to
00:45 - join a game jam for some time if you're
00:47 - not familiar with easy unless they are a
00:49 - group of awesome people who cover gaming
00:51 - news reviews and more so check out their
00:53 - YouTube channel so with this being such
00:55 - a unique and interesting game jam I
00:57 - thought it was time to give it a shot
00:58 - the uniqueness of the game jam was in
01:01 - making a game with a bunch of weird
01:02 - rooms designed to annoy the player for
01:04 - example one of the rules was to make
01:06 - character that randomly trips up the
01:07 - player another one is to have the
01:09 - characters constantly talk about
01:11 - mountain dew and have a very garish
01:12 - looking armor the end result of all that
01:15 - is a nice small RPG with a turn-based
01:17 - battle system with various characters
01:18 - and enemies the game is actually quite
01:21 - complex and the reason I've been able to
01:23 - make it in such a short amount of time
01:24 - is due to what I always talk about the
01:26 - videos which is the importance of
01:28 - writing clean reusable code as I go
01:30 - through an overview of how the game was
01:32 - made you won't see many elements which
01:33 - were created previously and simply added
01:35 - on to this game so if you've been
01:37 - following the channel for some time you
01:39 - might recognize various elements let's
01:41 - start off by going through part of the
01:43 - game and then we'll go more in-depth
01:44 - into how each system works if you like
01:47 - you can pause the video right now and go
01:49 - play the game then come back here to
01:51 - continue watching the game is rather
01:53 - quick only around 20 minutes so go play
01:55 - it right now so the video doesn't spoil
01:57 - anything alright let's get to it we
02:00 - start off in a rather simple main menu
02:02 - here we just have gotten to play and
02:05 - want to quit as we hit play we can see
02:07 - the recipe which are the weird rules
02:09 - that the game must abide by so as you
02:11 - can see we have an extremely annoying
02:13 - sidekick
02:13 - then the button to taunt the NPC's is
02:16 - the same as the used consumable the
02:18 - player has a different sprite in the
02:19 - portrait the enemy wins in a cutscene
02:22 - and so on
02:23 - okay so continue here are the controls
02:26 - very simple movement and interaction now
02:29 - here we are in the game itself and we
02:31 - start the story
02:32 - we have a simple dialogue system with
02:34 - some text writing once the intro text is
02:37 - done then here we are in the over map so
02:41 - here we can move around very simple
02:43 - movement and we keep moving in counter
02:45 - our first enemy we talk to him and after
02:48 - a while we go into our battle screen so
02:51 - here we are in a very simple turn-based
02:53 - battle system
02:54 - I've actually covered this in a separate
02:55 - video last week now we can do our simple
02:58 - attack there he goes attacks once it's
03:00 - done it's the enemy's turn and he does
03:01 - his own attack and in this case he
03:03 - missed so we can keep attack him and
03:06 - destroy him
03:06 - we go back into the Oval map and the
03:08 - enemy has been destroyed keep going and
03:10 - we go into another fight now here we are
03:14 - and on this battle system we also have a
03:17 - special move the special differs per
03:19 - characters so our three different
03:21 - classes have three different special
03:23 - attacks this one is a powerful kick so
03:26 - president boom there he goes then when
03:30 - it's done it's on a cool-down so we now
03:32 - do our normal attacks to defeat town
03:33 - right there it is another one now we
03:37 - keep going
03:38 - and eventually you find our character
03:40 - which is blocking our passage first he
03:43 - starts off as an enemy so we need to
03:45 - defeat them
03:56 - and now we won and now he joins our team
03:59 - as he joins his annoying sidekick comes
04:03 - along with us so just like now we now
04:05 - have another member in our party now
04:08 - sleazier again one of the rules is to
04:10 - trip me up and yep he does it right away
04:12 - so I cannot move and that is indeed
04:13 - quite annoying so we keep going into
04:16 - this nice map and as we reach the town
04:20 - we have to go and talk to this NPC which
04:23 - is the other room where another NPC just
04:26 - randomly has the exact same sprite as
04:27 - the player and it is never explained
04:29 - then we keep going and go into a nice
04:32 - simple tavern and over here we get
04:37 - ambushed by enemies there you go some
04:39 - nice particle effects and yep we go into
04:41 - another battle so now we have two
04:43 - members in our team against three
04:45 - enemies so I can do a normal attack with
04:47 - this one and now on the tank character
04:50 - it has a different special so we hit it
04:52 - if there you go a nice AoE attack any of
04:55 - we win when we win then the humor which
04:58 - is the final character joins our party
04:59 - alright so this is the basics for how
05:02 - the game goes we move around the map we
05:05 - talk to NPCs from a story and pattern in
05:07 - a turn-based battle system so this is a
05:10 - fully functional simple RPG that was
05:12 - built in two weeks and you can go to
05:14 - edge to play the whole game and also you
05:16 - can download the project files from the
05:18 - website so you can see how all of this
05:19 - is set up so now that we've seen an
05:22 - overview let's see how each system is
05:24 - set up and what systems I've managed to
05:26 - reuse starting with the main menu here
05:28 - it is very simple we just have some
05:30 - buttons to play and quit and a bunch of
05:33 - extra buttons with information on the
05:34 - side the way the transitions are made is
05:37 - essentially with different selves so we
05:40 - start off with the south main then we
05:41 - hit play then we go into the recipe play
05:44 - so this one shows then we go into the
05:46 - controls and then we go into the game so
05:49 - here we are in the main menu hit play
05:50 - and there we go
05:51 - and the text is animated and pops up
05:54 - over time and we hit play and here it is
05:57 - just a simple thing and hit play okay so
06:00 - here we are in our game scene we start
06:01 - off with some story exposition so in
06:04 - here I've made this simple dialogue
06:06 - system it is very simple it only has two
06:09 - of all characters and text being written
06:11 - right now there's only one character
06:13 - talking so the right one is hidden so we
06:15 - can pause in order to go up here in turn
06:18 - look at our UI and here it is the
06:20 - download window and how it's set up so
06:22 - we have left character than the right
06:23 - character which is currently hidden live
06:25 - chat bubble right left name and right
06:27 - name this is a very simple dialogue
06:30 - system but the game is meant to be
06:31 - extremely simple so it's perfect for
06:33 - this scenario so let me know in the
06:34 - comments if you'd like to see a video
06:36 - dedicated to building a dialogue system
06:38 - now one of the rules is for the player
06:40 - sprite to be different in the portrait
06:41 - and in the over map so that's why the
06:43 - player has that sprite and in here the
06:45 - portrait is different once we get
06:47 - through the starting story here it is
06:48 - our main character the movement code was
06:51 - made in the simple character movement
06:53 - video so I can move them around with a
06:55 - keyboard but it would also be possible
06:57 - to use gamepad input now over here we
07:00 - have some hitboxes so if I go in there I
07:02 - cannot leave the map so the player is
07:04 - constrained to the plane area and if we
07:06 - pause we can see how the map is set up
07:08 - so here it is the entire game these game
07:12 - objects are what defines the various
07:14 - events that happened over the course of
07:16 - the game so as you can see in here the
07:18 - player start up in here this starts off
07:20 - the first enemy that has a specific text
07:22 - then the second one and then the tank
07:24 - gets spawned in here this laser and so
07:26 - on so as we move you can see everything
07:29 - is set up the map is on inside a nice
07:32 - game object where we have the visuals
07:34 - and also our hit boxes so there yo these
07:36 - are all the hitboxes so here for exemple
07:39 - you can see there's an invisible head
07:40 - box here to make sure that the player
07:42 - correctly interacts with this enemy
07:43 - before going through when he defeats
07:45 - this enemy then this head box won't
07:47 - become disabled so the player can keep
07:49 - moving and so on and so on so in here
07:51 - the same thing this one is blocked then
07:53 - it defeats the tank then the sprite and
07:56 - the hitbox both get vanished and as you
07:58 - can see on the entire map it's pretty
08:00 - simple since this is a very simple game
08:02 - jam game so we simply have this path so
08:04 - the player goes here goes here then
08:07 - keeps moving fight the evil monster get
08:09 - stuck in the dungeon moves towards evil
08:11 - monster - it was back in the dungeon
08:12 - then this head box disappears then he
08:15 - moves through into the third evil
08:17 - monster encounter for the enemies you
08:20 - can see that they have some very
08:22 - roaming behavior so there he is stopped
08:24 - and after a while he simply moves to a
08:26 - position nearby his spawn position and
08:29 - all the NPCs are simply I don't just
08:31 - stand or decode for the enemy overlap is
08:34 - also very simple since all the combat is
08:37 - done on a separate scene the code in
08:39 - here similar looks to see if the player
08:40 - is nearby and moved towards him
08:42 - so in here if the player is within a
08:45 - certain target range then he moves
08:47 - towards him and if he is within a attack
08:49 - range then we have our interaction which
08:52 - then depending on this character type
08:54 - you won't either unload the starting
08:56 - cutscenes article simply unload an enemy
08:58 - encounter okay so let's approach our
09:01 - first enemy here we are let's move to
09:04 - the right and there's the enemy right
09:05 - there he sees me moves towards and
09:07 - engages the cutscene now you can see
09:10 - that dialogue is between two characters
09:12 - so here's the dialogue window and as you
09:14 - can see the left character is now
09:16 - slightly faded which only means this one
09:18 - is on gray now we keep talking and there
09:21 - you go some nice text writer on the text
09:23 - along with some sound and after a while
09:25 - here we go we go into our battle now
09:28 - I've covered the creation of this
09:29 - turn-based battle system in the last
09:31 - video so go check that out to see how it
09:33 - was made here this one has a couple more
09:35 - features unlike for example multiple
09:36 - targets and special attacks but the
09:39 - basics are do a normal attack there you
09:40 - go attacks now it's his turn now he goes
09:42 - attacks and so on right so once we
09:45 - defeat him we go back into our over map
09:47 - and the enemy was killed so he no longer
09:50 - gets spawned when you go back into the
09:51 - over map well let's go into another
09:53 - battle just so we can take some damage
09:56 - okay so here we are we took some damage
09:58 - and now we need to go back into the over
10:00 - map there you go our health matches so
10:02 - the healthcare is between battle to
10:04 - battle how that is set up is by using a
10:07 - simple character class and let's see how
10:08 - its set up here it is the character
10:11 - class over here we have a type for each
10:14 - unique type then we also have some basic
10:17 - stats and down here on our constructor
10:20 - we receive a type and based on that type
10:23 - we initialize these stats so here the
10:25 - player starts off with 35 attack 120
10:28 - health and so on gaming Senshi AIT's a
10:30 - character when the game starts and keeps
10:33 - them in memory throughout the
10:34 - game that memory stored here in a game
10:37 - data class we have the various states
10:39 - that handle the story state and all the
10:42 - characters are stored in a simple list
10:44 - so they had initialized just once and
10:46 - there you go everything is like that for
10:48 - adding them here it is manually adding
10:50 - all the important characters so the
10:52 - player tanks laser in the healer and
10:53 - then it cycles through the map which is
10:56 - the map prefab that you saw previously
10:57 - and we insensate the characters that
11:00 - means in order to edit the map all we
11:02 - need to do is go in here and modify our
11:04 - prefab so in here I could have mana mean
11:07 - here by simply duplicating that game
11:09 - object and having it in there the data
11:11 - that is used to instantiate the
11:13 - character is stored in this simple model
11:15 - behavior so it is the position of the
11:18 - game object and then these stats to make
11:20 - sure which character it should be
11:21 - spawned so that's pretty much how the
11:23 - world design works just a bunch of game
11:25 - objects that define positions and what
11:27 - character type should be on that
11:28 - position
11:29 - okay now let's continue with the game
11:31 - now after fighting the first two we
11:34 - reach the tank blocking the tower
11:35 - entrance now there are four types of
11:38 - characters on the / map there's the
11:40 - player then there's the enemies then we
11:42 - have NPCs and farmers right now the tank
11:45 - is an NPC so he's just standing around
11:47 - and not doing anything by being near an
11:50 - NPC and pressing the interact but I can
11:52 - start a cutscene the cutscene that gets
11:55 - started depends on the game state so the
11:58 - aim state is stored in here on the game
12:00 - data as you can see we have just a very
12:02 - simple state variable and we leave
12:05 - various states so we do a switch and if
12:06 - we were interacting with an NPC and we
12:09 - are on a certain state then we start a
12:10 - certain cutting okay so over here we
12:13 - talk to the tank very simple and again
12:17 - here we are back in our battle scene
12:19 - with a different enemy type and over
12:21 - here I can now use a special for a very
12:23 - powerful kick now he attacks he does his
12:27 - normal attack and now normal time okay
12:30 - so just like this now I've defeated the
12:32 - tank and we go back into the over map
12:34 - and again it is the state to load the
12:36 - correct cutscene and over here we talked
12:39 - some like this name and go back to the
12:41 - over most so here we are back in the
12:43 - over map and slizzer immediately does
12:45 - his own thing
12:46 - now the tank is a forward instead of an
12:49 - NPC so that means he keeps track of the
12:50 - distance to the player and if it's far
12:52 - enough he moves towards him and that's
12:54 - it sneezer has a timer on his script and
12:58 - after a certain amount of time there you
13:01 - go he runs towards a player as soon as
13:03 - he gets within a certain distance the
13:05 - player trips up plays a small animation
13:07 - and can no longer move until it gets
13:09 - back up and everything proceeds so you
13:12 - see we also have various chat bombs
13:14 - being popped up these ones related to
13:16 - the fountain view are simple prefabs so
13:18 - they simply get in Senshi ated they are
13:21 - static prefabs in order to be able to
13:23 - have an image in the middle of the text
13:25 - whereas the other ones where this laser
13:27 - says and he replies those are dynamic
13:30 - chat bubbles meaning that the background
13:32 - extends based on the text so those are
13:35 - very similar to how the tone tip works
13:37 - okay continuing in the game we also have
13:39 - a nice quest arrow pointer this was also
13:42 - created in a previous video you saw
13:44 - previously pointing towards the tank
13:46 - with an exclamation mark and right now
13:48 - it's pointing there to the right and if
13:50 - we approach there go the position turns
13:52 - into 1x and when we get within a certain
13:55 - distance of our target there you go we
13:58 - unload another cutscene when we finish
14:00 - this cutscene there you go it's now
14:03 - pointing into a different direction and
14:05 - with a different color and as soon as we
14:07 - go there you go we nice exclamation
14:09 - point again check out the dedicated
14:11 - video to see how that works it's a very
14:13 - simple element now this character here
14:15 - is the one that is the examine like the
14:17 - player but never acknowledged so we
14:19 - talked to him and now we go towards the
14:21 - tavern and over here we have a bunch of
14:25 - NPCs just playing a simple iPhone
14:27 - animation over here is a healer which is
14:30 - currently just an NPC so he's not doing
14:32 - anything and when we approach this
14:34 - position it won't load another cutscene
14:37 - where the enemies won't ambushers now
14:39 - how that is set up we can see over here
14:41 - pause and go over here and here they are
14:44 - they get spawned right here in this
14:46 - corner so they're essentially just out
14:48 - of view and when we start the cutscene
14:51 - we won't play some nice particle effects
14:53 - and then they won't be teleported on to
14:55 - their correct positions so let's see
14:57 - that in action
14:58 - here we go start each cutscene all right
15:01 - now see the particle effects and now
15:04 - those characters get teleported in there
15:05 - as you can see they are no longer on the
15:07 - court okay so now is a good time to look
15:09 - at how the cutscenes are set up over
15:12 - here is a nice static classic contains
15:14 - all the cutscenes so down here we can go
15:17 - to the tavern ambush here is the tavern
15:20 - ambush cutscene so in this case we start
15:23 - off by destroying the pointer then we
15:26 - show the UI a black background we stop
15:29 - the over map from running so on the
15:31 - enemy stop roaming then we set the
15:33 - dialogue actions the dialogue is very
15:35 - simple so it only works linearly so
15:37 - essentially every action follows another
15:39 - one so we set those actions then we go
15:43 - into the very first one where we show
15:44 - the dialogue window then Sheldon left
15:47 - character with this pride show the
15:48 - unlife character name left text hide the
15:51 - right character right tags right name
15:53 - then when we go into the cutscene for
15:56 - the enemy spawning here it is we get the
15:59 - player position then we position the
16:01 - enemies in sin she ate some smoke
16:03 - particles and then we hide them so they
16:06 - are hidden while see smoke animation is
16:08 - playing and after a short amount of time
16:10 - they become visible all the timing is
16:14 - handled in here by the function timer
16:15 - which is a class from the code monkey
16:17 - utilities that you can get from the
16:18 - website then we keep going through our
16:21 - dialogue the enemy says his text and
16:24 - then we load our enemy encounter so all
16:27 - the cutscenes in the game are handled by
16:29 - this class so as you can see all of them
16:31 - play thanked after join play tank before
16:33 - join and so on we have all them ok so
16:37 - back into our game let's go through the
16:40 - dialogue and into battle and here as you
16:43 - can see we have multiple enemies and
16:44 - also the tank is now on our team so can
16:48 - select target and let's hit that one up
16:49 - there and now again the special attack
16:51 - is different so we can now try out the
16:53 - tank special attack and there you a nice
16:57 - AoE effect
16:59 - ok let's defeat them and here we are now
17:03 - we meet the human so now with all the
17:05 - team members in our party we can carry
17:07 - on with our quest well as soon as
17:09 - sleazier wants me go
17:10 - so let's wait
17:11 - if there is he is indeed very annoying
17:13 - okay so keep going and we're going to go
17:15 - into our shopkeeper and talk to him and
17:19 - there you go a very simple dialogue and
17:21 - when it's done we have the simplest
17:23 - basic shop possible and here we just
17:26 - have a very basic UI window here it is a
17:29 - UI window with just a few buttons Garen
17:33 - button is disabled and the others add
17:35 - points to either our health or our found
17:37 - you amount so just click on it and there
17:40 - you go our in your goes up and the store
17:42 - goes out of stock and so on now these
17:45 - ends are stored over here on the game
17:47 - data we just have two very simple ends
17:51 - okay so we keep going with the game and
17:54 - I last thing that I want to show is the
17:56 - animated cutscenes so here we are
17:59 - fighting the evil monster for the first
18:01 - time now the rules say that the monster
18:04 - should somehow we reckon Slee win the
18:06 - fight even though we kill me so we get
18:07 - them down to zero HP ok let's see if he
18:21 - dies on this hips and there we go as
18:24 - soon as he dies plays the animated
18:25 - cutscene and here we go he goes any
18:27 - spawns from behind any punches to play
18:29 - so just like that he miraculously won
18:31 - even though we actually destroyed and
18:34 - when we're done again based on our game
18:36 - state we now we had teleport into the
18:37 - dungeon and we start in here
18:39 - so here we meet the other character and
18:43 - after talking to him for a while he
18:46 - decides to untie us and there you go
18:50 - just simple movement and destroying the
18:52 - rope game objects before continuing on
18:54 - with down there we go the same particle
18:56 - effect he vanishes and here we are back
18:58 - into the cutscene so that's pretty much
19:01 - it for all of the unique elements of the
19:03 - game so again if we pause we can see the
19:06 - entire path of the game so we are right
19:08 - here in the dungeon so now the goal is
19:10 - to go in here meet the evil monster for
19:12 - the second time and we're going to lose
19:13 - again then we go back here then this
19:15 - package gets destroyed and we can then
19:19 - go and find the third battle where we
19:21 - can finally win let's just go over here
19:24 - to the second chair
19:25 - which has a fun new armor and that is
19:27 - again here on the character Spandana
19:29 - simply a bone has found your armor so
19:31 - when this shopkeeper is spawn he has the
19:34 - armor so let's meet him
19:37 - and also else in the over map we can
19:39 - press base in order to use one of the
19:41 - health potions and we heal everyone on
19:43 - the team ok so here we are talk to him
19:46 - and he has the armor available so click
19:48 - on it and there you go we equip the
19:50 - armor and there it is it replaced our
19:52 - previous body so now the player is
19:54 - wearing the special armor now the way
19:57 - this works is by replacing pixels on the
19:59 - players spreadsheet so in here we can
20:00 - pause look at the player spreadsheet and
20:03 - there you go there's the player
20:04 - spreadsheet and as you can see it has
20:06 - this body whereas previously we can see
20:08 - the original spreadsheet here is the
20:11 - original spreadsheet as you can see this
20:12 - body was replaced and it was replaced
20:16 - with this one in here this one so we
20:19 - just copy pasted these pixels onto the
20:21 - player spreadsheet check out the videos
20:23 - I've done on the gift spreadsheets as
20:25 - used in battle rata kun which explains
20:27 - how to read and copy pixels so you
20:29 - simply merge textures dynamically based
20:31 - on certain logic so in this case when he
20:33 - equips the special armor alright and
20:36 - just for the animated cutscene how that
20:39 - works here it is that he is handled in a
20:42 - different scene so in here we have the
20:44 - cinematic one which is the one where
20:46 - they in lose and here you can see how it
20:48 - is set up so it's very simple there's
20:50 - just an animation game object with a
20:52 - animation and over here we have the
20:55 - various poses of the characters and if
20:58 - we go into the animation we can play it
21:00 - and there you go first place through
21:02 - that one then that one shows up then
21:03 - that one shows up then down goes in
21:05 - there and that one goes in there and
21:06 - after a while there we go after seven
21:09 - seconds we then hold back into the over
21:10 - map so this is the cutscene where they
21:13 - lose and then the other cutscene where
21:15 - they win so here it is with a bunch more
21:17 - character poses and again the same thing
21:20 - just a game object with a animation and
21:23 - we play it and goes like that the player
21:25 - player defeats goes but then he defeats
21:28 - him and then he's on the floor and
21:30 - slizzer picks up the weapon and
21:33 - then he's standing around and sleazier
21:35 - stabs him in the back and there you go
21:37 - slizzer wins the day and yep there it is
21:41 - alright so that's pretty much it for our
21:43 - in-depth overview this was a very
21:46 - interesting game to make and I'm quite
21:48 - pleased with the end result it's a very
21:50 - nice simple old-school RPG you can get
21:53 - the project files yourself and try to
21:54 - expand upon it by making different maps
21:56 - and different story as you saw out the
21:58 - game is quite complex even though it was
22:00 - built in just two weeks the reason is
22:02 - because I was able to reuse quite a lot
22:04 - of code from previously made elements so
22:06 - as I only say make sure you always write
22:08 - clean code so you can reuse it in the
22:11 - future many thanks to easy on ice for
22:14 - setting up such a silly game gem and if
22:16 - you're interested in keeping up with
22:17 - gaming news and reviews go check them
22:19 - out on YouTube as always you can
22:21 - download the project files in the Tonys
