00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - and my game is finally out right now
00:04 - this has been quite an intense journey I
00:06 - definitely underestimated how much work
00:07 - it would be to make a game and regular
00:09 - videos at the same time but I finally
00:10 - reached the Finish Line I'm really happy
00:12 - with the end result I wanted to make a
00:14 - fun game with some automation Colony
00:15 - building and defense elements and I
00:17 - wanted to make it work in both single
00:18 - player and Co-op multiplayer and yep I
00:20 - did manage to achieve that lately every
00:22 - time that I go to test the game I end up
00:24 - playing way too long because I'm just
00:25 - enjoying playing the game that's always
00:26 - a good sign so I generally hope that you
00:29 - enjoy playing the game and speaking to
00:31 - you as an instructor I highly recommend
00:32 - that when you publish your games you ask
00:34 - your players to leave reviews reviews
00:35 - matter a ton on the same algorithm so
00:37 - now speaking to you as a developer
00:39 - myself I'm asking you to go ahead and
00:40 - review my game I really hope you like it
00:42 - and I'm looking forward to reading all
00:43 - your feedback as always this channel is
00:45 - all about learning and full transparency
00:47 - so I will be doing a video covering all
00:49 - of the sales numbers all the costs
00:51 - whether I hit my original goals and
00:53 - doing a postmart down the game what went
00:54 - right and what went wrong I'm really
00:56 - happy with how the game is right now but
00:58 - there are still lots of ideas that I'd
00:59 - love to EXP spend upon this but before I
01:01 - do that now that the game is out I will
01:02 - be constantly reading all the feedback
01:04 - and spend this week pretty much fixing
01:05 - any bugs and doing any improvements that
01:07 - I can after that for the rest of this
01:09 - month I really want to get back to
01:10 - making some tutorials some courses
01:12 - regular videos and so on basically all
01:14 - the things that I put on hold whilst I
01:15 - was working on this game now as you play
01:17 - the game go ahead and tell me which
01:19 - mechanics and systems you would like to
01:20 - see some tutorials on like perhaps the
01:22 - character customization perhaps you want
01:24 - to know how I built that or perhaps
01:26 - you're curious as to how the off Works
01:28 - maybe how I made this really nice 3 the
01:30 - UI maybe how all the dinki is set up and
01:33 - how each machine works personally I'm
01:35 - really proud of the game both in terms
01:36 - of just being a good game but perhaps
01:38 - even more so the quality of the code
01:39 - that I wrote especially these past few
01:41 - weeks when I was doing this super huge
01:43 - Sprint I wrote a massive amount of
01:45 - really high quality code I'm really
01:46 - happy with that so basically later this
01:48 - month I want to cover a bunch of
01:50 - tutorials on a lot of these systems let
01:51 - me know which ones you'd like to see
01:52 - most and I also want to thank you for
01:54 - following me on this journey this was
01:56 - quite stressful making videos alongside
01:58 - making a proper game this was quite a
02:00 - bit more worth than I anticipated but I
02:02 - really enjoyed reading all of your
02:03 - comments especially on dev Vlogs and
02:05 - your feedback for the demo build that
02:07 - was super helpful so thank you all so
02:08 - much and I also really hope that foll me
02:10 - along on this really nice six- month
02:12 - journey I hope this was helpful to see
02:14 - how I make games how I take something
02:15 - from prototype onto a final game on
02:17 - scene you can go watch the very first
02:19 - prototype to see just how far the game
02:20 - has come I really hope that watching
02:22 - this journey has helped you and inspire
02:24 - you to work on your own projects okay so
02:26 - go ahead and pick the game and please
02:27 - remember to write a review they really
02:29 - do help and stay tuned for the video
02:31 - covering all the revenue numbers and
02:32 - everything that I learned with this
02:33 - project all right so go play the game
02:35 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
02:36 - next time
