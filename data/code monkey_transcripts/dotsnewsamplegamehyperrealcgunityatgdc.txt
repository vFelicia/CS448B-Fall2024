00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - so gdc has just wrapped up and unity had
00:05 - quite a bunch of interesting things to
00:06 - show they made some news and had a bunch
00:08 - of sessions on their twitch channel
00:10 - which you can go watch here's some
00:11 - highlights first one was their brand new
00:14 - real-time cg demo called enemies really
00:16 - insanely impressive video by now i'm
00:18 - already pretty used to seeing some
00:20 - gorgeous hyper rail environments but
00:22 - seeing a fully cg character of this
00:24 - quality is truly insane
00:25 - honestly i thought it was green screen
00:27 - until zoomed in quite a bit further and
00:29 - again the more insane thing is the fact
00:31 - that this is running in real time so
00:33 - we've reached a point where we can
00:34 - render 30 frames per second whereas 20
00:36 - years ago it took days to render a
00:38 - single frame there's a bunch of
00:40 - technical details from the rendering
00:41 - lead of this project on twitter and also
00:43 - from the live stream the most important
00:45 - one that tons of people were wondering
00:47 - is what hardware is this running on
00:50 - the answer is this is all running in
00:51 - real time at 4k 30fps with an i7 and an
00:55 - rtx 390. so definitely a high-end
00:57 - machine but nothing too insane it's not
00:59 - running on a huge render farm
01:01 - and another thing that people asked is
01:02 - what version of unity is this running
01:04 - usually these impressive demos require
01:06 - tons of custom things added on top of
01:08 - the regular engine with lots of tweaks
01:10 - sometimes in the source code itself
01:12 - but that is not the case in this
01:13 - scenario this one is using standard hdrp
01:16 - on a vanilla unity editor it's using
01:18 - raytraced and screen space for ambient
01:20 - occlusion ray trace shadows and
01:22 - reflections as well then for the hair
01:24 - usually that's one of the toughest parts
01:26 - and this demo definitely has some of the
01:28 - best hair that i've ever seen apparently
01:30 - there's a hair package coming out in q2
01:32 - there were even more details in the live
01:34 - stream afterwards which you can go watch
01:36 - in the phone font they showcase it
01:38 - running in real time in the editor
01:40 - really zoomed in to see all the
01:41 - impressive detail and plays around the
01:43 - hair system in the end of the live
01:45 - stream they even played around with
01:46 - changing the hair color in the eyes and
01:48 - the whole thing runs great so extremely
01:50 - impressive and again the fact that this
01:51 - is running in real time is truly
01:53 - mind-boggling this demo will be released
01:55 - sometime soon so you can try it out for
01:57 - yourself now usually i stick with urp
01:59 - since i tend to prefer more stylized
02:01 - games over something hyper real but i'm
02:03 - definitely interested in exploring out
02:04 - this project when it's out i definitely
02:06 - want to at least take a look to that
02:08 - really awesome fire shaded effect they
02:09 - made and speaking of urp the next big
02:12 - news is a new sample game this one is a
02:14 - complete game so it's not just a demo
02:16 - not just a visual scene it's also
02:18 - extremely impressive really if you told
02:20 - me this was the next big budget console
02:22 - exclusive i'd have believed you it's got
02:24 - excellent art excellent sound world
02:26 - characters environment really everything
02:28 - this does not look like a simple simple
02:30 - game it looks like a proper well-made
02:32 - awesome game this project will also be
02:35 - downloadable and the final version will
02:36 - be a free game on seam there was a talk
02:39 - during the live stream that showed some
02:40 - gameplay and tons of details for how it
02:42 - works
02:43 - basically the team at unity used a ton
02:45 - of unity tools to build this demo really
02:47 - validating all their tools in a real
02:49 - production scenario
02:51 - it uses the new input system syn machine
02:53 - timeline uses the localization package
02:56 - visual scripting state machines navmesh
02:58 - for pathfinding a bunch of physics lots
03:01 - of scriptable objects for only use cases
03:03 - it uses animation breaking the effects
03:05 - round shadow graph and tons more by the
03:07 - way just a quick point for my courses my
03:09 - goal with my ultimate in the overview
03:11 - course is exactly to teach all these
03:13 - unity tools and features unity has so
03:16 - many tools that chances are you don't
03:17 - know about some of them and they might
03:19 - be super useful for whatever you're
03:20 - currently working on there's already
03:22 - over 15 lectures each covering a
03:24 - different tumor feature of the engine
03:25 - including many of these and i'm
03:27 - constantly updating the core since
03:28 - there's still even more tools left to
03:30 - cover so check it out if you want to
03:32 - learn how many of these things work they
03:34 - also use some of their own assets which
03:36 - i think is a great example for how you
03:38 - actually make games during the prototype
03:40 - stage they use their awesome third
03:42 - person star asset this one is free and
03:44 - it's really awesome i made a video on
03:46 - how quickly you can get started using it
03:48 - and have a character up and running
03:50 - they also use another excellent package
03:52 - the photon mode i haven't covered that
03:54 - one but i've looked into it and it's
03:55 - pretty great and for the water on this
03:57 - game they also grabbed the shader from
03:59 - their previous simple project the boat
04:00 - attack demo so this one is a great
04:03 - example on how they reuse tons of things
04:05 - to really help them develop this game
04:06 - possibly the most useful thing to come
04:08 - out of this simple game is the character
04:10 - controller it's a kinematic character
04:12 - controller with tons of features
04:14 - easily handles touching physics objects
04:16 - interacting with hinges moving platforms
04:18 - rotating objects and so on they showed a
04:21 - really awesome character gym with all
04:22 - kinds of obstacles and the character
04:24 - controller perfectly handles all of them
04:26 - it's got various inclines slopes and
04:28 - steps lots of moving objects a bunch of
04:30 - gears and some rolling balls there's a
04:32 - bunch of jump pads it even has some
04:35 - dynamic contextual animations where the
04:36 - character leans and pushes the arm out
04:38 - when on a steep slope it really is a
04:40 - very impressive very versatile character
04:42 - controller i think if they were to turn
04:44 - this into an asset it would be hugely
04:46 - helpful to a ton of people and even if
04:48 - they don't specifically do that you'll
04:50 - still be able to get the phone project
04:51 - and get it yourself i'm really looking
04:53 - forward to trying this one out
04:55 - so this ammo project is looking really
04:57 - awesome you can sign up to be notified
04:59 - when the download is available i've done
05:01 - that already and i can't wait to try it
05:03 - by the way if you find the video helpful
05:05 - please hit the like button it's a tiny
05:06 - thing but it really does help thanks
05:08 - some more news that actually happened
05:10 - before gdc the updated state of unity
05:12 - dots i covered it in a quick news video
05:15 - basically they just made a massive
05:17 - update and they're on track for
05:18 - launching 1.0 next year during gdc they
05:21 - had a great q and a section where they
05:22 - answered a bunch of questions
05:24 - it was co-hosted by johnny from turbo
05:26 - mix games check out his channel if
05:28 - you're interested in some more dot's
05:30 - content in there they talked about the
05:31 - various goals for dots 1.0 again
05:34 - emphasizing how dots does not replace
05:36 - game objects they can work very well
05:38 - together they also clarify that the dots
05:40 - netcode is meant for dots whereas for a
05:42 - game object you have the ml api which is
05:45 - now also known as netcode for game
05:47 - objects a really awesome part of that
05:49 - session was when they brought out a
05:51 - developer behind the massive vr mmo
05:53 - zenith to talk about their tech the game
05:55 - has been massively well received and
05:57 - uses dots in a bunch of various ways
05:59 - it's a vr mmo so that's very demanding
06:02 - and must run extremely smooth rlc
06:04 - players feel very nauseous for example
06:06 - having game objects with scripts
06:08 - constantly running some game dxp logic
06:10 - it's very tough to handle that with that
06:12 - many xp events and that many players in
06:14 - a performant way
06:16 - but when swapping just that part for ecs
06:18 - then the logic is very simple
06:20 - most of the game is game object based
06:22 - but each game object also has an entity
06:24 - attached to it so in this case instead
06:26 - of running game object on logic for
06:27 - every single exp gamed event it just
06:30 - adds an exp component an ecs component
06:32 - to the entity connected to that game
06:34 - object and then the system goes through
06:36 - all the entities that gain the xp and
06:38 - handles them all at once also lots of
06:40 - great comments on how they use a hybrid
06:42 - workflow basically using game objects
06:44 - where game objects make sense and using
06:46 - entities where entities make sense and
06:48 - really just combining both to make the
06:50 - best game possible
06:51 - so again whenever you hear anything
06:53 - about dots remember it's something you
06:55 - use alongside game objects you don't
06:57 - have to go with just one or just the
06:59 - other combining both will likely give
07:01 - you the best results then they brought
07:03 - out another developer behind the game
07:05 - detonation bracing which also uses dots
07:08 - in this case they use dots for recording
07:10 - and playback of phone races since ecs is
07:13 - data oriented it makes it super easy to
07:15 - save the entire game state
07:17 - that's great for recording gameplay and
07:18 - making demos and they use it for some
07:21 - better playtesting and reproducing bugs
07:23 - so as the tester is playing the game the
07:25 - game is constantly recording then if the
07:28 - tester finds a bug they can upload the
07:29 - exact same demo file and then the dev
07:32 - can just play back that demo and rerun
07:34 - the exact same series of inputs you
07:36 - replicate the issue and then fix the bug
07:38 - it's a really excellent use case which
07:39 - is made really easy if you're using ecs
07:42 - then there was the roadmap tonk they
07:44 - talked about how unt versions work the
07:46 - lts and the tech system i made a video
07:49 - on that topic if you don't know the
07:50 - logic behind those versions
07:52 - they talked about their core pillars for
07:54 - the upcoming 2022 tech stream
07:57 - so those being rendering performance and
07:59 - improved features with urp
08:01 - then their goal is also editor
08:03 - customization with ui toolkit after that
08:06 - another important pillar is netcode for
08:08 - game objects that one is currently in
08:09 - preview so it should be fully out
08:11 - sometime within this year and finally
08:13 - continuing to make lots of platform
08:15 - optimizations
08:16 - so nothing too flashy but it's really
08:18 - nice to see some more stability and
08:20 - performance along with multiplayer and
08:22 - finally seeing the ui toolkit
08:24 - there was another road map talk with a
08:25 - bunch more detail but that one was on
08:27 - gdc itself so there's no public
08:29 - recording i've asked the unity team if i
08:31 - can see those slides and if i do then
08:33 - i'll see if i can make a video on that
08:35 - also you might have seen me in the
08:37 - visual scripting session i was there
08:39 - alongside ashley and assan going over
08:41 - the basics of visual scripting and in
08:43 - the end i also showcased a pretty
08:45 - complex script from my fps game from my
08:47 - visual scripting course it's an entire
08:50 - game made entirely with visual scripting
08:52 - there's not a single line of code
08:53 - anywhere in any of the course games it
08:55 - was pretty fun to join their live stream
08:57 - and talk a bit about visual scripting i
08:59 - saw lots of great comments in chat so
09:01 - thank you all for joining me
09:02 - one thing that ashley wanted to mention
09:04 - but we ran out of time was the visual
09:06 - scripting roadmap we didn't get to it in
09:08 - the live stream but the page is live so
09:10 - you can go see what's coming up in that
09:12 - page you can also find the roadmaps for
09:14 - tons of things related to unity and the
09:16 - live stream also had a bunch of creative
09:18 - spotlights this is their series where
09:20 - they invite a developer from a game made
09:22 - with unity and they go inside the editor
09:24 - and talk about the various tips and
09:25 - tricks they use in making the game these
09:27 - are always super interesting for me the
09:30 - best one was on tunic it's a gorgeous
09:32 - game that was in development for seven
09:34 - years it's finally released and it's
09:35 - getting some awesome reviews they show
09:37 - the game running in the editor one of
09:39 - the things that i love seeing was the
09:41 - massive difference with and without post
09:43 - processing and what individual effects
09:45 - they use it really makes a huge
09:46 - difference i also love seeing their vfx
09:49 - tricks for example using meshes for
09:51 - particular paths and tons of use case
09:53 - for some simple scrolling textures
09:55 - really clever tricks and the final
09:56 - effects look gorgeous also showcase some
09:59 - interesting grass character avoidance
10:01 - pretty simple just a math and a collider
10:02 - but it works great so yeah that was my
10:05 - favorite one but there were a bunch more
10:06 - on various games it's really interesting
10:08 - to see how all of these games work under
10:10 - the hood and last of all at the very end
10:13 - of the live stream on the unless they
10:14 - were the unity awards lots of awesome
10:16 - games tools and creators were nominated
10:19 - in tons of unique awards
10:21 - and as you might have heard from my
10:22 - previous video or my updated banners yep
10:24 - i won the best tutorial creator award
10:27 - this was voted by the community so thank
10:29 - you all so much i'm really happy that
10:31 - people enjoy these videos and i plan to
10:33 - keep making them for a very long time
10:35 - i've got lots of awesome stuff planned
10:36 - for this year so next year hopefully
10:38 - i'll also be worthy of your vote so
10:40 - thanks again alright so that was unity
10:42 - at gdc22
10:44 - really great stuff i really enjoyed
10:46 - watching these past three days congrats
10:48 - to the entire unity team i think they
10:50 - all did a wonderful job setting all this
10:52 - up and making all these awesome projects
10:55 - who knows maybe next year when
10:56 - international travel becomes a bit
10:58 - easier i might be there in person to
10:59 - watch all this awesome stuff live
11:01 - alright so thanks for watching and i'll
11:03 - see you next time
11:15 - [Music]
11:19 - you
