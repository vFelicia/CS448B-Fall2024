00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and a while ago I saw this post on
00:04 - Twitter talking about the realities of
00:05 - game development and what success is all
00:07 - about it got a lot of attention on
00:08 - Twitter and then also on Reddit This
00:10 - Thread has lots of useful info and some
00:12 - numbers on this one specific game which
00:14 - is very much representative of the
00:15 - general results of a lot of Indie Games
00:17 - however it also has a bunch of
00:18 - statements about the Indie Dev industry
00:20 - that are not accurate so I want to give
00:22 - you my point of view the particular
00:23 - statement that I really disagree with is
00:25 - that it's all about luck and as a Dev
00:27 - you have almost no control as if the
00:29 - game is just a lottery ticket now I
00:31 - really don't want this video to come off
00:32 - as any kind of attack on this Dev I know
00:34 - how much it sucks to have a flop I've
00:36 - had a bunch of those myself so I fully
00:38 - understand that this Dev isn't really in
00:39 - a good state of mind to think too
00:41 - rationally it really sucks when you
00:42 - spend years on something and you get
00:44 - zero results so if the dev is watching
00:46 - this please don't take my comments too
00:47 - harshly I'm just using this game and
00:49 - these tweets as an example to talk about
00:51 - some topics that a lot of people think
00:52 - about I will first discuss the indie
00:54 - game Market in general and then more
00:56 - specifically on why I think this
00:57 - particular game didn't sell as well as
00:58 - the dev wouldn't like by the way way
01:00 - this video is a new format I'm trying
01:01 - out where I give you my thoughts on some
01:03 - topic I have a different perspective
01:05 - from a lot of people since I've been
01:06 - doing Game Dev for over 10 years now
01:07 - with many published games so I think
01:09 - hearing my point of view on some more
01:11 - General topics can be available to some
01:13 - of you there's lots of things that are
01:14 - very important with regards to Game Dev
01:16 - other than just technical tutorials so
01:18 - let me know in the comments and like
01:19 - this video if you enjoy this kind of
01:20 - just talking format so to start with the
01:23 - thread actually has some actual sales
01:24 - numbers for the game for about 5 months
01:27 - these are indeed pretty much numbers
01:28 - that I would expect for something like
01:30 - let's call it someone's second game for
01:32 - a first game you would probably only
01:34 - sell a dozen copies and for a second
01:36 - game maybe a couple hundred and most
01:38 - indie game devs don't make more than one
01:39 - or two games so the Empire would say
01:41 - these numbers are absolutely an accurate
01:43 - representation of the great majority of
01:44 - Indie Games then some stats on emailing
01:46 - press streamers and content creators
01:48 - they sent out over 2 000 Sim keys and
01:51 - about 10 of them created some content
01:54 - this I would say is actually higher than
01:55 - expected but it all depends on who those
01:57 - 2000 press people are if you email some
01:59 - smaller channels people that get
02:01 - something like 100 views per video you
02:03 - might need to get more content created
02:04 - since those people will likely be very
02:06 - appreciative of getting a steam king but
02:08 - with Sophie views it is unlikely to lead
02:10 - to any sales then a bunch more sets on
02:12 - the state of the indie game Market over
02:14 - half of the games make essentially
02:15 - nothing there's only about 15 to 20 of
02:18 - games making over 50k after that is the
02:21 - charge showing the number of releases
02:22 - every year there are more and more games
02:24 - coming out not to mention that all of
02:26 - the other games that already exist they
02:27 - still continue existing meaning if you
02:29 - launch a game this year you are still
02:31 - sort of competing with something like
02:32 - Terraria that came out a decade ago so
02:34 - there's lots of stats in this thread and
02:36 - they are indeed accurate and they do
02:37 - paint a pretty tough picture this Dev
02:39 - also makes an excellent point that
02:41 - perfectly encapsulates why I would never
02:42 - tell someone to quit their job and
02:44 - gamble everything on their first game
02:45 - would you accept a job if they said you
02:47 - would only get paid after several years
02:49 - of work and with no guarantees of how
02:51 - much that will be and there's still a
02:53 - huge chance it won't be much less than
02:54 - minimum wage this is indeed the reality
02:57 - so definitely don't quit your day job
02:58 - expecting to make the next stardew
03:00 - Valley I will definitely not lie to you
03:02 - and tell you that all of this is wrong
03:03 - and finding success as an in-depth is
03:05 - super easy it's definitely not it's
03:07 - really difficult but with that said the
03:08 - opposite of that that it's all about
03:10 - luck and nothing else is also not true
03:12 - that's pretty much a conclusion that
03:14 - this Dev reached after I'm looking at
03:15 - their stats they say that the idea of a
03:17 - meritocracy is a complete illusion and
03:19 - people should stop pretending that luck
03:21 - isn't a gigantic Factor this is where I
03:23 - would definitely disagree with it I
03:24 - would actually say that the Indie Dev
03:26 - Market is pretty much as close to a
03:27 - meritocracy as it can be however there's
03:29 - one huge asterisk when I say that people
03:31 - listen that and they think okay so that
03:33 - means I just have to make a good game
03:35 - and that's it and no that is not what
03:36 - I'm saying at all making a good game is
03:38 - only a tiny tiny portion of what is
03:40 - required to find success nowadays
03:41 - meritocracy means you need a good game
03:43 - coupled with good marketing you can't
03:45 - just focus on making the game and
03:47 - completely ignore marketing and expect
03:48 - to find success that will not work
03:50 - nowadays if you do then yes that
03:52 - strategy is indeed completely depend on
03:54 - luck I've made a video while ago all
03:56 - about marketing and I titled it the most
03:58 - important skill to be a successful game
03:59 - upper that is not an exaggeration that
04:02 - really is the reality also the concept
04:04 - of a meritocracy is depend on the
04:06 - quality of the final product meaning it
04:08 - has absolutely nothing to do with how
04:10 - much effort you put into it there are
04:12 - some excellent games that are indeed
04:13 - excellent that were made in just a
04:14 - weekend and there are some really poor
04:16 - games that were made in years this is
04:18 - one fallacy that a lot of Indie devs
04:19 - fall into how much effort you put into
04:21 - the game does not matter when it comes
04:22 - to finding success with players the
04:24 - players only care if the game is good
04:25 - they don't care how long it took to make
04:27 - it might sound harsh but that is the
04:29 - truth you can sacrifice years of your
04:31 - life building something whereas someone
04:32 - else can build something in a weekend
04:34 - and the players might prefer the other
04:35 - game that's really just how it is if
04:37 - you're regular on this channel then
04:38 - you've certainly heard me talk nonsouth
04:40 - about the importance of wishlist
04:41 - speaking of that go ahead and wishlist
04:43 - my own Sim game Total War Liberation we
04:45 - can look at cmdb to guess how many
04:47 - wishlists this game had at lunch we can
04:49 - look at the chart and we can see that
04:50 - just before release the game had about
04:52 - 90 followers the general rule of thumb
04:54 - is that wish lists are 10 times
04:56 - followers so this means that the game
04:57 - had probably under a thousand wishlists
04:59 - at launch if you show me a game that has
05:01 - a thousand wishlists my guess would
05:02 - indeed be exactly the results that this
05:04 - game got a couple dozen or a couple
05:06 - hundred copies wishing lists are an
05:08 - excellent predictor of sales that is why
05:09 - everyone myself included asks you to
05:11 - wishlist their game nowadays if you want
05:13 - to find success you need to launch with
05:15 - a bare minimum of at least like 5 000
05:17 - wishlists anything less than that and
05:19 - you're unlikely to be better that launch
05:20 - when the game releases one of their main
05:22 - tweets is also very much a false premise
05:24 - talking about the handful of positive
05:26 - reviews that the game has and using that
05:28 - as a way to state that the game is
05:29 - objectively good the only thing that
05:31 - this means is that those handful of
05:32 - reviewers did enjoy the game that's it
05:34 - it does not mean that the game is
05:35 - objectively good you can't really make a
05:37 - statistically valid conclusion on just a
05:39 - dozen reviews now don't get me wrong I'm
05:41 - not saying that the game is banned I'm
05:43 - mainly saying that looking at a
05:44 - headphone reviews does not prove the
05:46 - game is objectively good and somehow
05:48 - based on that it should have sown much
05:49 - better so my advice to you as a
05:51 - developer is don't download yourself
05:52 - into thinking your game is objectively a
05:54 - masterpiece just because a handful of
05:56 - people liked it another extremely
05:57 - important concept is what does success
05:59 - really mean this word means different
06:00 - things to different people in the thread
06:02 - this developer talks about vampire
06:04 - survivors and stray as examples of
06:06 - success let me point out that these are
06:08 - not examples of success instead these
06:10 - are examples of Mega massive Monumental
06:12 - success I really take issue with this
06:14 - kind of mentality because it completely
06:15 - ignores the huge spectrum between those
06:17 - two extremes there is a ton of space
06:19 - between games that make five thousand
06:21 - dollars and games that make a hundred
06:22 - million you don't need 100 million to
06:24 - consider that success personally I
06:26 - consider myself a successful indie game
06:27 - developer I've made eight games I've
06:29 - been making a living from my games for
06:31 - over 10 years now and of course none of
06:33 - my games have made a hundred million so
06:35 - yes you can definitely count Mega hits
06:36 - on one hand but the games that make say
06:38 - between 50 and 100K there are plenty of
06:41 - those those are not just 0.16 of new
06:43 - games I actually made a blog post a
06:45 - really long time ago titled sustainable
06:47 - living as an indie bottom feeder I made
06:49 - that blog post just before launching my
06:51 - game hypernites which was certainly not
06:53 - a mega hit like vampire survivors and
06:55 - actually did worse than I expected but
06:57 - since my costs are very low it was still
06:59 - very much enough for me to make a living
07:00 - basically what I'm trying to say is that
07:02 - success is relative for some people like
07:04 - me living in Portugal making 1K a month
07:06 - is considered a success but someone
07:08 - living in San Francisco they might need
07:10 - 10K a month just to survive but
07:11 - regardless of your definition of success
07:13 - no one needs 100ml to survive there's a
07:15 - huge spectrum between selling zero
07:17 - copies and the massive Mega hits
07:18 - speaking specifically about this one
07:20 - game and analyzing what might have
07:22 - caused it to some importantly first of
07:23 - all like I already said wishlist under 8
07:25 - 000 wishlist is not a good amount I'm
07:27 - sure if the dev is listening they might
07:29 - be shouting at their screen saying I was
07:31 - too busy working on the game to handle
07:32 - marketing and yep I do get that it's
07:34 - really difficult but that is the reality
07:36 - of the market you can't just make the
07:37 - game you also have to Market it then on
07:39 - the game itself visuals are extremely
07:41 - important if you have subpar visuals you
07:43 - need something truly magical to stand
07:45 - out the amount of games that have found
07:47 - success with some poor Visions can be
07:49 - cutting on one hand so things like
07:51 - undertale it needs to be that kind of
07:52 - special to make it for me I have my
07:54 - regular seam new release videos where I
07:56 - go through the new release list and pick
07:58 - 10 interesting games if I I had seen
08:00 - this game and maybe I didn't I probably
08:02 - wouldn't look at it for more than 3
08:03 - seconds I'm sorry if that sounds harsh
08:05 - but that is a reality nowadays you need
08:07 - good Visions you need to send out the
08:09 - game itself also doesn't really seem to
08:10 - have any unique hook it looks like yet
08:12 - another turn-based RPG with really
08:14 - nothing special to make it send out the
08:16 - title is somewhat intriguing it's called
08:18 - video game fables but the description
08:20 - just has a generic turn-based RPG so any
08:22 - couple all of those things with a very
08:24 - high premium price point of 20 dollars
08:26 - you really end up in a place where it's
08:28 - really tricky for someone to buy maybe
08:29 - the gameplay is really excellent but
08:31 - with these visuals with no immediate
08:33 - apparent unique hook and with a high
08:35 - price point very few people won't take
08:37 - the ammo and actually buy it when there
08:39 - are so many other games at this price
08:40 - point or lower so to give a clear answer
08:42 - to the question in the title is in the
08:44 - Game Dev all about luck I would say
08:46 - absolutely not but that also does not
08:48 - mean that success is easy it most
08:49 - definitely is not it is very hard but if
08:52 - you have a good unique hook if you have
08:54 - good presentation if you Market your
08:56 - game before launch and gather over 10
08:58 - 000 wish lists and of course if the the
08:59 - game is good regardless of how long it
09:01 - took to make with all of those
09:02 - conditions yes I believe success is very
09:04 - much possible very much within your
09:06 - control as much as it can be some amount
09:08 - of luck is always a factor but if you
09:10 - work hard and you work smart then I
09:12 - believe that luck is only a small
09:13 - portion of the final equation as an
09:15 - example I'm currently working on my next
09:16 - steam game total worm Liberation I
09:18 - talked about my hopes and goals in the
09:20 - announcement video I'm not relying on
09:22 - luck to achieve any of those I thought
09:23 - long and hard to come up with what I
09:25 - think is a pretty good unique hook I
09:27 - focus hard on the visuals to make them
09:28 - the best they can be considering I'm not
09:30 - an artist I'm obviously marketing the
09:32 - game over here on this channel on my
09:33 - Twitter on my other games and everywhere
09:35 - I can and of course I'm working hard on
09:37 - actually developing the game to make it
09:39 - the best game that I can make and like I
09:41 - mentioned success is relative if you
09:42 - look at my goals you won't see that none
09:44 - of my definitions of success are based
09:46 - on selling a million copies finally just
09:48 - one message to the dev this game in case
09:49 - they're watching they mentioned that
09:51 - they've only suffered from depression
09:52 - and anxiety and obviously this is not a
09:54 - helpful result my advice to that is
09:56 - remember that Game Dev is a marathon it
09:58 - is not a Sprint so don't put your entire
10:00 - life worth on a single game for me I've
10:02 - been working as an indie Dev for over 10
10:04 - years now and all that time I've had a
10:06 - bunch of success and also a bunch of
10:07 - Fallout the follow-ups do hurt they are
10:09 - indeed very painful but remember it's
10:11 - just one game of the many that you won't
10:13 - hopefully create for example I was
10:14 - really crushed when my game survived
10:16 - Squad gauntlets flop really hard I love
10:18 - that game I still do nowadays I think
10:20 - it's really interesting I worked on it
10:22 - for over a year and on launch I don't
10:23 - think it even sold 100 copies that
10:25 - definitely got me down for quite a while
10:27 - it was very painful but after that I
10:29 - made gamecorp DX which ended up being
10:31 - one of my most successful games ever so
10:33 - remember it's a marathon it's not a
10:35 - Sprint if a project goes bad take some
10:37 - time off then study what went wrong
10:39 - figure it out and use that to make the
10:40 - next one better if you do then I am
10:42 - certain you won't find a success that
10:43 - you're after in the long run
