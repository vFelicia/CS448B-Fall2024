00:05 - you can provide a unique identifier for
00:07 - your player to then interact with other
00:08 - unity services like for example cloud
00:10 - save so you know what save data belongs
00:12 - to that player the best part is it can
00:14 - be all completely done automatically and

00:48 - async function so don't forget the async
00:50 - in the function definition and the await
00:52 - in the function call register to the
00:54 - authentication events the code that i'm
00:56 - using here is taken straight from the
00:57 - dock so pause the video or check the
00:58 - docs make a function to sign in
01:00 - anonymously call it after the
01:02 - initialization and that's it run the
