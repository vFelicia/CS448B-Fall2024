    "- [DEF]: Statistical method that compares frequency of words in two different corpora, determining which words are more strongly associated with one corpus; essentially, we find distinctive words between two groups of texts, where that set of distinctive words is more associated with one group than another (positive vs. negative review language)! what words are \"over-represented\" and \"under-represented\" in one group of texts compared to another?\n",

    "    - Identify characteristic vocabulary that distinguishes different channels or video categories\n",

    "    - Accounts for both presence and absence of terms\n",
    "- Interpretation:\n",
    "    - A higher LLR score for a word in a specific channel indicates the word is distinctively assocaited with that channel's content\n",
    "    - Simultaneiously, the score measures how unlikely it is that the word's frequency in that channel occured by chance compared to its appear across all channels\n",
    "    - And it's statistically significant!!!\n",

    "- [DEF] extension of LLR. uses z-scores to adjust word frequency differences, highlighting over- and under-represented words between two corpora (in other words, highling polarized or distinctive words; FightingWords has historically been used for political speeches, for example). typically used when there is a need to focus on identifying polarized language or specific distinctions in word usage between corpora.\n",
    "- Interpretation: so, FightingWords calculate Z-Scores on a 95% confidence interval, corresponding to a Z-Score range of [-1.96,1.96]; any Z-Score outside of that is statistically significant at 95% confidence, where a positive Z-Score is more indicative of Channel A and a negative Z-Score is indicative of Channel B. As a practical example, let's say we were comparing word usage between Black Girls Code versus code.org. If we looked up that specific comparison .csv and looked at the word \"black\": the Z-Score is +25.37, meaning that the word \"Black\" is very strongly associated with Black Girls Code in this particular channel comparison.\n",
    "- In the context of our data, it would help:\n",
    "    - Highlight polarized or distinctive language between different channels\n",
    "    - Identifying words that are strongly associated with specific content types\n",
    "    - ** Detecting significant vocabulary diferences between different groups of videos **\n",
    "- How does this differ from what we've done before (TFs, TFDs, TF-IDFs...)?\n",
    "    - Incorporates statistical significance through using z-scores\n",
    "    - Accounts for sampling variability in word frequencies\n",
    "    - More robust when dealing with varying transcript lengths\n",
    "- Implementation: we'd basically need to \"borrow\" the code from open-source repositories, adapt it for our own purposes, save it as a Python script... like this one (https://github.com/jmhessel/FightingWords) or this one from Myra Cheng, a PhD in CS advised by Dan Jurafsky (https://github.com/myracheng/markedpersonas/blob/main/marked_words.py). ***Our implementation ended up taking from both.***"
